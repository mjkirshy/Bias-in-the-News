Cleared of collusion and flush with victory, President Trump is a man unleashed, ready to tackle everything thats evaded him over the last two years. His first target is health care. Were going to get rid of Obamacare, Trump said at a rally in Grand Rapids, Mich., on Thursday. And I said the other day, the Republican Party will become the party of great health care. Its good. Its important.

To that end, Trump had directed the Justice Department on Monday to seek the invalidation of the entire law, backing a federal district judge in Texas who declared it unconstitutional late last year.

Unraveling the Affordable Care Act would deal a catastrophic blow to the safety net. The health exchanges and new insurance regulations? Gone. Medicaid expansion, which even in its truncated form has reached people in 36 states? Gone. The host of protections for people who get health care through jobs and private insurers? Gone. Republican elites might cheer this destruction, but soon enough they would face millions of voters who pulled levers in 2016 believing that Trump and the Republican Party would protect them.

Remember, Trump did not run for president as an orthodox conservative Republican. He embraced social programs and so-called entitlements, rejecting the partys boilerplate on government and the economy. Im not going to cut Social Security like every other Republican, and Im not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid, he said during the campaign. Elaborating on health care, he told CBS News that everybodys got to be covered, which he called an un-Republican thing to say. I am going to take care of everybody, he added. I dont care if it costs me votes or not.
