Former President Barack Obamas DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson said Thursday that the U.S. is truly in a crisis at the southern border.

A little bit of context here. When I was in office in Kirstjen Nielsens job, at her desk, Id get to work around 6:30 in the morning, and there would be my intelligence book sitting on my desk, the PDB, and also the apprehension numbers from the day before, Johnson said during his appearance on MSNBCs Morning Joe.

My staff would tell you if it was under 1,000 apprehension the day before, that was a relatively good number, and if it was above 1,000, it was a relatively bad number, and I was going to be in a bad mood the whole day.

On Tuesday there were 4,000 apprehensions. I know that a thousand overwhelms the system. I cant imagine what 4,000 a day looks like. So, we are truly in a crisis, he continued.
