A federal judge in Alaska declared late Friday that President Trumps order revoking a sweeping ban on oil and gas drilling in the Arctic and Atlantic oceans is illegal, putting 128 million acres of federal waters off limits to energy exploration.

The decision by U.S. District Judge Sharon Gleason is the third legal setback this week to Trumps energy and environmental policies. The judge, who was appointed to the federal bench by President Barack Obama in 2012, also blocked on Friday a land swap the Interior Department arranged that would pave the way for constructing a road through wilderness in a major National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska.

Earlier this week, U.S. District Judge Lewis T. Babcock, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan, ruled that Interiors Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service illegally approved two gas drilling plans in western Colorado. The judge said officials did not adequately analyze wildlife and climate impacts in their plans  which were challenged by a coalition of environmental groups  to drill 171 wells in North Fork Valley, which provides key habitat for elk and mule deer.

Trumps rollbacks of Obama-era conservation policies have suffered nearly two dozen setbacks in federal court, largely on procedural grounds. While the administration is appealing many of these decisions and holds an advantage if the cases reach the Supreme Court, the rulings have slowed the presidents drive to expand fossil fuel production in the United States.

Earlier this month, for example, a federal judge halted drilling on more than 300,000 acres of oil and gas leases in Wyoming. Fridays decision on offshore drilling could affect a five-year leasing plan the administration plans to issue in the summer, as well as block the six offshore lease sales it proposed to schedule in the Arctic Ocean starting as early as this year.

President Trumps lawlessness is catching up with him, Erik Grafe, the lead attorney from the environmental law organization Earthjustice who argued to reinstate Obamas leasing withdrawals in the Arctic and Atlantic, said in a statement Friday. The judges ruling today shows that the president can not just trample on the constitution to do the bidding of his cronies in the fossil fuel industry at the expense of our oceans, wildlife, and climate.

Industry officials, however, said the administration could forge ahead with its offshore drilling process as litigation continued. While Fridays decision applies to 98 percent of the Arctic Ocean, it only covers undersea canyons in the Atlantic, stretching from the Chesapeake Bay to New England, as opposed to the entire Eastern Seaboard.

While we disagree with the decision, our nation still has a significant opportunity before us in the development of the next offshore leasing plan to truly embrace our nations energy potential and ensure American consumers and businesses continue to benefit from U.S. energy leadership, said Erik Milito, vice president of upstream and industry operations for the American Petroleum Institute.

The Interior Department declined to comment Saturday.

In her Friday ruling, Gleason wrote that the law in which Congress gave the president authority over offshore drilling  the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act  expressly allows for leasing withdrawals but does not state that a subsequent president can revoke those withdrawals without congressional approval.

As a result, the previous three withdrawals issued on January 27, 2015 and December 20, 2016 will remain in full force and effect unless and until revoked by Congress, she wrote.

In a separate decision earlier in the day, Gleason found that then-Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke did not provide sufficient justification for reversing the governments stance on whether to allow a small, remote Alaska town to construct a road through the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge.

Residents of King Cove have argued for years that they need to bisect the refuge, which has been protected for decades and provides a critical rest stop for migratory waterfowl, for medical evacuations under rough weather.

In a statement Friday, local leaders there vowed to continue their fight.

The people of King Cove deserve to have access to a higher level of care, especially when the unforgiving weather prevents them from traveling from their isolated community by air or boat, said Aleutians East Borough Mayor Alvin D. Osterback. This land exchange would have accomplished that.

Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) also promised to continue pushing for building the road, which otherwise would be prohibited in a wilderness area. I will never stop until this road is a reality and the nearly 1,000 residents of this isolated community have a lifeline for emergency medical care, she said.

Opponents counter that the federal government has provided millions in funding to give town residents alternative forms of transport and warn that a road would fragment critical habitat. They also cite expert testimony that any road through the refuge would be impassable during snowstorms.

Here, the Secretarys failure to acknowledge the change in agency policy and his failure to provide a reasoned explanation for that change in policy are serious errors, Gleason wrote.
