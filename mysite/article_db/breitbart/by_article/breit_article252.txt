Donald Trump Meets with Populist Conservative Brazil President

Trump said he was “honored” to be compared to Bolsonaro, who was described as a “Trump of the Tropics” during his conservative populist campaign that propelled him to victory, shocking the Western hemisphere.

The leaders expressed hopes for an improved relationship between the two countries, despite friction in the past.

“I think there was a lot of hostility with other presidents,” Trump said. “There’s zero hostility with me.”

Bolsonaro thanked Trump for the meeting and praised his leadership.

“It”s an honor to be here after decades of anti-America presidents,” Bolsonaro said. Referring to Trump, he added, “He wants an American great and I want a Brazil great too.”
