If youre confused about Brexit, you certainly arent alone. Britains path toward leaving the European Union is complicated and confounding  full of forks, U-turns and more than a few dead ends. Even seasoned Brexit watchers have been left at a loss for words.

British Prime Minister Theresa May might try for the fourth time to get parliamentary support for the withdrawal deal she negotiated with E.U. representatives. On March 29, lawmakers rejected her stripped-down deal by 58 votes, marking the third time shes failed to convince the British Parliament to move forward with a plan for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union.

After the latest failed vote, E.U. leaders quickly scheduled a new round of talks for April 10 in Brussels.

Britain is now in crisis mode as it inches closer toward the possibility of an economic earthquake  a no-deal withdrawal. As my colleagues in Britain wrote after the third vote failed, Britain now has until April 12 to propose a new way forward, or crash out of the bloc without a deal, or beg for a long extension.

But to understand how the Brits got here and whats at stake, we need to back up a bit.

Q: What is Brexit?

A: May has said, Brexit means Brexit. But what that means is that Britain plans to leave the E.U., gaining the ability to control its borders and make its own trade deals  or, as some people see at it, losing the automatic free-movement and free-trade rights that come with membership.

Q: Why is Britain leaving the E. U.?

A: Basically, because Brits voted for it, 52 to 48 percent, in a referendum on June 23, 2016. Concerns about immigration and sovereignty were the top reasons people voted to leave.

Q: Who voted for Brexit?

A: England and Wales voted to leave, while Scotland and Northern Ireland wanted to remain. London was strongly against. The vote divided both main political parties: Conservatives and Labour. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn voted to remain, though he is lukewarm on the E.U. and has regularly criticized it as a capitalist club. May, a Conservative, also voted to remain  though she asserts, repeatedly, that she is committed to delivering on the referendum result. Among the most notable Brexiteers are Boris Johnson, Mays former foreign secretary, and Jacob Rees-Mogg, another Conservative.

Q: So when does Brexit happen?

A: The original departure date was supposed to be March 29. But the British Parliament hasnt yet agreed on how to leave. It has now rejected Mays withdrawal plan three times. Last week, E.U. leaders granted a short extension. If British lawmakers had approved Mays deal this week, they would have left E.U. by May 22. Now they must plan an alternative by April 12 or leave without any transition provisions or protections that evening.

Q: Why does Parliament need to approve Brexit, after there was already a referendum?

A: The referendum wasnt legally binding, and it asked people only if they wanted in or out of the E.U.  not how they should leave. Because Britain is a parliamentary democracy, meaning Parliament is sovereign, it was agreed after a lengthy legal debate that Parliament would get a meaningful vote on the deal  a decision that significantly complicated Mays negotiations.

Q: Whats in her withdrawal deal?

A: The 585-page deal lays out things such as a timetable for a transition period, what happens to E.U. nationals living in Britain and the amount of money Britain has to pay the E.U. It doesnt get into anything about trade deals or other aspects of the future relationship between Britain and the E.U. Thats saved for a whole separate set of negotiations, to the chagrin of all those with Brexit fatigue.

Q: Why dont people like Mays deal?

A: Hardcore Brexiteers think she has made too many concessions to Europe. They want a more decisive split. Those who are more pro-Europe argue that the deal risks economic damage to Britain without sufficient benefits.

Q: Whats the issue with the Irish border?

A: An open border on the island of Ireland has helped to resolve decades of conflict  allowing unionists in Northern Ireland to feel securely part of the United Kingdom while republicans in the north can feel connected to the Republic of Ireland in the south. But that open border has been possible only because the E.U.s customs union and single market avoid the need for border checks. Once Northern Ireland leaves the E.U., along with the rest of the United Kingdom, there will have to be a different way to preserve an open border and maintain peace. Thats where the backstop comes in.

Q: Whats the backstop?

A: Its an insurance policy to guarantee an open border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. Until a future trade deal somehow dispenses with the need for border checks, or until technology is developed that does the job of border agents and achieves an invisible border, the backstop would require the United Kingdom to remain in the E.U. customs union and parts of the single market. Thats controversial in part because the U.K. would be subject to E.U. rules even after losing its say over them.

Q: Could Brexit be stopped?

A: Theoretically, yes. The E.U.s highest court ruled last year that Britain could unilaterally reverse its decision to leave. A petition to cancel Brexit has garnered more than 5 million signatures, becoming the most popular petition ever hosted on Parliaments website. Those numbers triggered a Parliamentary debate for Apr. 1. But many lawmakers would be wary of supporting a complete reversal, and, anyway, theyre several steps away from that happening.

Q: Couldnt Britain just hold a second referendum?

A: Since the Brexit vote in 2016, the prospect of a second referendum has gone from something barely imaginable to something remotely possible. The idea has considerable public support. About a million people demonstrated in London in favor of a peoples vote on March 23. But critics argue that a second referendum would be deeply damaging to democracy and a betrayal of those who chose to leave. It could also unleash further political chaos.

Q: Have people changed their minds on Brexit?

A: Certainly some have. But many people feel even more strongly now about the stance they took and have begun to define themselves as leavers or remainers. Polls suggest that a slight majority of Brits would now opt to remain in the E.U., but that swing is partly the result of changing demographics. Younger people are overwhelmingly pro-remain, and teens who couldnt vote in 2016 are now of voting age. Meanwhile, the majority of voters 65 and older voted to leave  and some of them have since died.

Q: Whats the worst-case scenario for Brexit?

A: Most economists would say a no-deal Brexit, a scenario in which Britain leaves without an agreement with the E.U. and without the two-year transition period that comes with it. Most likely Britain would revert to World Trade Organization trade rules at its borders. But the sudden break could cause major disruptions to trade and travel. The International Monetary Fund projected that up to 8 percent of Britains gross domestic product could be lost.

Q: Yikes. Are people prepared for that?

A: Britain and other E.U. countries have put together elaborate and costly contingency plans. Brits have also been hoarding toilet paper and chocolate just in case.

Q: How likely is a no-deal Brexit?

A: Its definitely possible. One study that came out before May made her deal last year estimated that there were five possible scenarios for Brexit. All but one resulted in no deal.

Q: Does the E.U. want a no-deal for Britain?

A: European leaders have voiced real concerns about a no-deal Brexit. It could potentially disrupt their own agreements, too. But the E.U. is also worried about other countries trying to leave, so it is driving a hard bargain with Britain and offering few concessions.

Q: Have E.U. leaders tried to help May at all?

A: To a degree, yes. In a letter published Jan. 14, European Council President Donald Tusk and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker explained that they did not want the Irish backstop to come into force, describing it as a suboptimal trading arrangement for both sides.

However, they also said there was little room for more negotiations, writing: We are not in a position to agree to anything that changes or is inconsistent with the Withdrawal Agreement. And after the deal was voted down a second time, Barnier basically said that the E.U. had done what it could do.

Q: Do any British politicians have a better idea?

A: Others claim to. Corbyn says he could solve the Irish border problem without a backstop, for example, and avoid a no-deal Brexit. But we probably wont find out how these ideas work in practice unless May loses her job.

Q: What would happen then?

A: \_()_/

Q: I have more questions that were not answered here.

A: We all do. Send them to us, and well try to answer them in an update.
