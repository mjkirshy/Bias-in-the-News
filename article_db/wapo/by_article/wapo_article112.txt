Some breaks in the cloud cover this morning made me think that we might make a run at 80 degrees today, but a quick return to overcast skies by the early afternoon put that thought to bed. Despite the clouds, temperatures rose into the mid- to upper 70s, which is not so bad for the last weekend of March.
