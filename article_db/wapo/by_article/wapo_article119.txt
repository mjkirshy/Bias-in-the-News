The Washington Nationals are going with Max Scherzer against the Philadelphia Phillies on Tuesday, so they can keep their ace on regular rest with a surplus of early-season off days.

And that decision carries even more significance than usual, at least for fans and television viewers. Scherzer will face Bryce Harper in his return to Washington.

Scherzer threw 7 innings and 109 pitches in a 2-0 loss to the New York Mets on Thursday. Manager Dave Martinez originally had Scherzer making his second start against the Phillies on Wednesday  with Anibal Sanchez making his Nationals debut a day before  but the pitchers have been flipped as Washington plans to keep a four-man rotation for the first two weeks of the year. Scherzer will have a normal four days between starts and welcome Harper back to Nationals Park after he signed a 13-year, $330 million deal with the Phillies in February.

If it is with the Phillies, hey, we got to face him, Scherzer said Feb. 28, as news of Harpers signing was breaking on social media. Itll be fun.

Now that fun will come a day earlier than expected. It is hard to place too much meaning on April games, especially since the season stretches through the spring, summer and into the fall. But Harper, once the Nationals homegrown franchise player, will step into the box against one of the best pitchers in the world, his teammate of three seasons, Washingtons anchor and the pulse of its clubhouse. That will mean more than enough. Clear your schedule for just after 7 p.m. on Tuesday.
