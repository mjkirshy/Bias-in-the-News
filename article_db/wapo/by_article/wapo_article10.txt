Bryce Harper played baseball on Thursday. For the Phillies. In Philadelphia.

Nationals fans, meanwhile, went to Opening Day in Washington, wearing red, white and sometimes blue. For some fans, this meant putting on clothes that had once honored Harper. Would they attempt to fix their jerseys? Or destroy their jerseys? Or just leave their jerseys the way they were? Lets take a look.

The rip

Has the added benefit of providing a cooling breeze.

The arts and crafts solution

Duct tape, markers, creative slogans, or even another name written out on tape? Sure, whatever.

It was kind of a last-minute decision," said Eric Pollard, 32, who wrote Anthony Rendons name on blue tape and covered up Harpers name on the back of his jersey. "I have a jersey with no name and no number, and I couldve gone with that, but this is more fun.

[Why Nationals fans chanted Lock him up! at Anthony Rendon on Opening Day]

Pollard, who bought the Harper jersey in 2013, is still debating whether to rotate the names taped on his back, or just get a new jersey. This could be a Trea Turner jersey next week, he joked.

As for Harper, well, Pollard once had dreams.

I wanted him to be a career player here, to stick around for 20 years, be another one of those guys like Ryan Zimmerman, and a perennial all-star," he said. "But baseball is a business and he got the best money he could get.

Pollard and his wife plan to attend Harpers return to Washington next week, and will likely boo the former star, but not out of hate.

He got plenty of comments for his handiwork on Thursday. And on his way down the ramp after the final out, a Nats fan tapped him on the shoulder and said, Your jersey is the best part about this game.
