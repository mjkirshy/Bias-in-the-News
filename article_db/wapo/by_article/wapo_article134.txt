It is 1928 and Berlin is at the center of a razzle-dazzle world between two wars. At the bustling Grand Hotel a series of eclectic guests and staff including a fading ballerina, a destitute baron, a wannabe-starlet typist, and an ailing bookkeeper collide in a non-stop musical toast to the high life.

Artistic Director Eric Schaeffer reunites the creative team behind last seasons smash hit A Little Night Music to conjure a scintillating musical destination where captivating characters played by Bobby Smith (Titanic, A Little Night Music), Natascia Diaz (Crazy for You), Kevin McAllister (Titanic), Nicki Elledge (A Little Night Music) and more converge with a lavish and lively score to embody the joy, style and decadence of the 1920s.

A showstopper at every turn.  TheaterMania
