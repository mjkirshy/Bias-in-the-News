How they got here: Gonzaga (33-3) finished the regular season 29-2, before losing to Saint Marys in the West Coast tournament final. The top-seeded Zags crushed No. 16 Fairleigh Dickinson in the NCAA tournaments first round, 87-49.

Texas Tech (29-6) shared the Big 12 regular season title with Kansas State before falling to West Virginia in the conference tournament quarterfinals. The No. 3 seed Red Raiders have hardly been tested in the NCAA tournament, with comfortable wins over No. 14 Northern Kentucky (72-57), No. 6 Buffalo (78-58) and No. 2 Michigan (63-44).

Elite Eight history: Gonzaga is in the Elite Eight for a fourth time. The Zags are 1-2 in their previous appearances, making their only Final Four appearance in 2017.

Since 2009, the Zags have an NCAA tournament record of 17-2 as the higher seed. . . . Point guard Josh Perkins, Gonzagas career leader in assists, has played 152 career games, more than any player in the country. . . . Entering the tournaments second weekend, Gonzaga also led the country in average scoring margin (plus-23.9), while Texas Tech ranked eighth (plus-14.0). . . . Texas Techs Jarrett Culver was the first Big 12 conference player of the year in program history. . . . Texas Tech has led by at least eight at halftime in 10 of its past 15 games. . . . Texas Tech Coach Chris Beard has a 7-2 career NCAA tournament record, while Gonzagas Mark Few is 31-19.

They said it: Come to Spokane. You will love it.  Gonzagas Zach Norvell Jr., asked this week about his school.

We have a lot of guys who arent five-star guys. The coaching staff and Coach Beard . . . came from a mid-major and started out coaching random teams and has worked his way up, and a lot of our guys are the same way. We try to embrace that, you know. We werent the highest recruited guys, but that not doesnt mean we cant compete with the best of the country.  Texas Tech guard Matt Mooney.

We respect [Gonzaga] a lot. Theyre one of the best teams in college basketball and its going to be one of the best games in college basketball history.  Margo Beard, Texas Tech Coach Chris Beards youngest daughter.

Jarrett Culvers NBA draft stock is soaring  maybe into the top five

A largely overlooked recruit out of high school, the Texas Tech guards profile has risen with a breakout sophomore season and a sensational NCAA tournament.

Texas Tech believes in its defense  and Coach Chris Beard  before Gonzaga showdown

The Red Raiders have become an NCAA tournament wrecking ball on defense, with locker-room energy to match. Next up: perhaps the nations best offense.

Gonzagas frontcourt stars reach Elite Eight, but leave NBA scouts divided

The Bulldogs Rui Hachimura and Brandon Clarke have garnered all-conference honors, but the junior forwards remain divisive NBA prospects.

Dont sleep on the Cavaliers, no matter how hard they make it to stay awake

Its easy to criticize top-seeded Virginias ponderous style, columnist Jerry Brewer writes, but you cant argue with the results: a berth in the Elite Eight.

With Carsen Edwards, Purdue always has a shot. Lots of them, in fact.

The prolific guard says he doesnt think about shooting slumps, not about the torrid performance that drove the Boilermakers to their third straight Sweet 16.

Hes a killer: Virginias Kihei Clark might be small, but he delivers big plays

Diminutive freshman guard shows poise beyond his years in helping the top-seeded Cavaliers reach the brink of first Final Four berth since 1984.

Gregg Nigls perfect NCAA tournament bracket is busted  all the way to 348th place.

He got 49 straight picks correct, but took a hard tumble Thursday night.
