AM: Its weird because I dont know him. I knew who he was, but I dont know him as a grown man. Its weird to feel like you have a kinship with someone because of shared adversity. I just want to ask, where was he at mentally when he heard [his first lawyer] Cristina Gutierrez was disbarred? Where was he at when he heard [state prosecutor] Kevin Urick testify that I recanted my story in 2010? Where was he in his head when he found out Serial went viral? What does he think about my involvement in this case? Because when Sarah [Koenig] told him that she reached out to me in Serial, you can hear him go silent, and I want to know what was in that silence. Was it hope?
