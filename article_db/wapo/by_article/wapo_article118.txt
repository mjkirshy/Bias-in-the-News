TAMPA  The Washington Capitals bench stood to watch the puck slide down the ice, poised for an empty net goal late in Thursday nights game against the Carolina Hurricanes. It went just wide, and what has felt like a foregone conclusion for roughly half the season would have to wait at least one more night. Captain Alex Ovechkin didnt seem nearly as disappointed as everyone else. What could have been his 50th goal of the season missed by inches.

Even enemy arenas now often root for him to reach this feat or another milestone, wanting to witness some history.

See how quick it changes when the team wins and were doing good? center Nicklas Backstrom said. Its a different story.

After years of weathering criticism  for not winning a Stanley Cup, for not being committed to two-way play, for not being enough of a team player  the perception of Ovechkin has changed over the past year, from a great player who was considered flawed to simply a great player who at last is beloved by most. He won a championship, and he did it with the defensive detail and team game so many thought he was incapable of. Now, as Ovechkin is again on the precipice of 50 goals, he finally has the acceptance of the NHL and those around it. They celebrate what he has accomplished without also pointing out what he hasnt. At 33 years old, he can become just the third player in league history with eight 50-goal campaigns, joining legends Mike Bossy and Wayne Gretzky. He would be just the fourth player to score that many goals in a season at this age or older.

Its obviously not too difficult for him, Tampa Bay captain Steven Stamkos said. Hes found a way to consistently produce in this league. Hes a horse out there. Hes a big, strong guy. His longevity has been amazing in terms of staying healthy and staying out on the ice and just producing. Its amazing to see. Im sure he had some doubters out there that think its going to stop, but he just finds a way.

Hes motivated, he loves to score goals, and with the shot that he has, when he shoots it, its going to go in a lot of the time.

Its the magnitude of Ovechkins longevity that has led to more appreciation as he has gotten older, similar to what happened with Jaromir Jagr as he continued to play past age 40. Players entering the league now are smaller and quicker, forcing the game to trend toward rapid puck movement, but Ovechkin is a vintage model in the midst of all of that. At 6-foot-3 and 235 pounds, he can play a physical style thats becoming rarer in todays NHL and still appeals to the purists. But his shot is still so mystifying that Ovechkin hasnt had trouble keeping up with the younger generation  and he has the youthful enthusiasm and gap-toothed grin to fit in with the kids.

Hes been that guy for so long, said 21-year-old Carolina Hurricanes sniper Sebastian Aho. Its not just the one year he scores 50; its like every year."

Said NBC Sports Network analyst Mike Milbury: He is a physical throwback. We used to call it truck-driver strong. Hes actually beefy and bold with a little bit of an edge.

Milbury was among Ovechkins harshest critics throughout his career. The former NHL player, head coach and general manager called Ovechkin a coach killer and described him as just a one-dimensional player. But he gushed about Ovechkin during the Capitals Stanley Cup run last postseason, and he has continued to do so this year as Ovechkin surprised even some of his teammates by showing up to training camp in impressive shape after a short offseason that featured some very public partying.

Ive changed my mind on him a lot, Milbury said. Its my job to be critical  analytical is a better word for it  but Ive always admired his physical skills. Hes just such a bull. His effort level on most nights was there physically but not always mentally. I dont think he thought the game through thoroughly, and I wondered whether he would finally get it. ...

"I thought there was a change in his approach, the little aspects of the game that mark a winner as opposed to an immensely gifted player. The little things like line changes, backchecking in the right spots, being willing to a block a shot at the right time, not spending three minutes on a shift.

When Ovechkin first stormed into the NHL as a 20-year-old, his talent dazzled, but he was scrutinized by the old guard for his flamboyant celebrations. Then, after his production slumped to 32 goals during the 2010-11 season and he followed with 38 in 2011-12  marks that still would be career years for most players  some questioned his commitment off the ice. Others posited that it could just be the beginning of Ovechkins decline. Ovechkin responded with 32 goals in 48 games the following year, the lockout-shortened 2012-13 campaign. He then put up three straight seasons with at least 50 goals. But he was flayed again for the teams shortcomings in the postseason.

We had been losing a lot in the first, second round and stuff like that, and people wanted us to go further, Backstrom said. Without that [success], youve got to get criticized. And it wasnt just him. It was the whole team. I just think thats normal. But it can change pretty quick in hockey."

These days, Ovechkin and his teammates raucous celebrations with the Stanley Cup were applauded, and his frequent milestones are no longer discussed with an asterisk. That he has been seen wearing a Well Im not Michael Jordan hoodie is considered more endearing than arrogant, as was his confidence Tuesday that he would score his 50th goal next game. Checking off that final item on his bucket list has helped Ovechkin feel freer, too, even if he never paid much mind to what was being said outside of his own locker room.

Maybe his game isnt yet back to the level it was in the playoffs a year ago, but this could be the most complete play he has shown over the course of the regular season. It hasnt gone unnoticed or underappreciated, including on the play Ovechkin nearly scored his 50th goal Thursday night in Carolina. Seconds before he shot the puck down the ice, he blocked a slap shot by Hurricanes defenseman Jaccob Slavin as his team defended a late six-on-five push.

To me, 50, not 50, lets talk about the two-way play and talk about him blocking shots, Capitals Coach Todd Reirden said. When you go back to huge difference-makers in our run last year and our success this year, its improved two-way play by him, and thats why hes out there at the end in that situation to get that opportunity. Hes growing a lot in that regard.
