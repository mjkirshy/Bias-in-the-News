Melting glaciers are revealing dozens of dead bodies on the worlds tallest mountain, according to news reports.

The treacherous journey to the summit of Mount Everest is riddled with obstacles  falling ice, ragged terrain, biting temperatures and incredible heights that cause altitude sickness. While nearly 5,000 people have successfully climbed the mountain, another 300 are thought to have died along the way.

Some of these bodies ended up covered in ice and remained hidden that way for many years. But now, climate change is accelerating the ice melt around them, exposing multiple limbs and bodies, the BBC reported last month.

Last year, a group of researchers found that the ice on Everest was warmer than average, and a study conducted four years ago found that ponds on the mountain were expanding with melting ice water, according to the BBC. But its not only melting glaciers that are exposing these bodies  its also the movement of the Khumbu Glacier in Nepal.

Most of the bodies are turning up at the Khumbu Icefall, one of the most dangerous spots on the mountain.

There, blocks of ice can unexpectedly collapse and glaciers can slip several feet downhill per day, The Washington Post reported in 2015. In 2014, 16 climbers were killed at once in that area, crushed under falling ice.

After searing tragedy, Everests deadliest route is off-limits

Removing bodies from the mountain is a delicate, dangerous and extremely costly task riddled with legal constraints. Nepals law, for example, requires government agencies to be involved when dealing with them, according to the BBC.

Whats more, most climbers like to be left on the mountains if they died there, Alan Arnette, a mountaineer, told the BBC.
