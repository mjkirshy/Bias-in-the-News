TAMPA  A mysterious illness working its way through the Washington Capitals locker room has taken its latest victim. Forward Brett Connolly is considered a game-time decision for Saturday nights game against the Tampa Bay Lightning after he wasnt feeling well enough to participate in the teams morning skate, according to Coach Todd Reirden. Connolly is the fourth player on the team to fall ill in the past eight days.

A little bit of adversity again so its about finding a way to work through it, Reirden said. Itll be a game-time decision, see how he does the rest of the day.

It started with Carl Hagelin last Friday; he was a late scratch against the Minnesota Wild with an illness. The next day, center Evgeny Kuznetsov was sent home from the teams practice facility for the same reason, but he then played on Sunday. Forward T.J. Oshie was under the weather Thursday and didnt play against the Carolina Hurricanes, but hell be back in the lineup Saturday.

This would be the first game Connolly has missed all season. Hes having a career year with 22 goals and 23 assists, and if hes out Saturday, winger Andre Burakovsky is expected to take his third-line right wing spot. The Lightning have already clinched the Presidents Trophy with the NHLs best record, but this game could have some standings implications for the Capitals. Washington has a three-point lead on the New York Islanders for first place in the Metropolitan Division, and the Islanders host Buffalo on Saturday night.

Between our medical staff and our trainers, they do a really good job disinfecting everything, Reirden said. Its just been strange how its gone like this, one by one. Its nice you can replace one guy at a time; its when you get six or seven guys sick that you get in trouble. Especially this late in the season, we dont need to be dealing with this. But were fine in a way and its opening up some chances for others.

Caps expected lineup:



Ovechkin-Backstrom-Wilson

Vrana-Kuznetsov-Oshie

Hagelin-Eller-Burakovsky

Stephenson-Dowd-Boyd



Djoos-Carlson

Orlov-Niskanen

Orpik-Jensen



Holtby to start  Isabelle Khurshudyan (@ikhurshudyan) March 30, 2019
