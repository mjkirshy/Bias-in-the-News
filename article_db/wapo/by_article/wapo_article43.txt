Ive been a photojournalist and documentary photographer for most of my adult life; Im accustomed to shooting news and capturing social issues. But over the past few years, I felt an inner drive to go deeper  to become more of an artist.

I needed to shake things up, so last April, around my 56th birthday, I traveled to the South of France for a workshop led by Antoine dAgata, a well-known Magnum photographer. His work is honest and hauntingly beautiful. Hes fearless. Working with him, I thought, might challenge me to expand my style.
