Colorados Senate passed the so-called red flag bill that allows law enforcement to seize peoples guns if a court rules them at risk to themselves or others.

Thursdays 18-17 vote, that saw no Republican support, moved the bill one step closer to Governor Jared Polis signature  who has already pledged to sign it into law if it reaches his desk.

The legislation, called House Bill 1177, has been slammed by the states sheriffs who have been supporting multiple counties efforts to become a Second Amendment sanctuary.

If you pass an unconstitutional law, our oaths as commissioners or myself as the sheriff  were going to follow our constitutional oath first, said Sheriff Steve Reams.

Advocates for the bill insist its intended to combat mental health issues as over half of Colorados suicides involve a firearm, a cause sheriffs are eager to address but not at the expense of everyones rights.

Its time we quit trying to put lipstick on a pig and start funding our mental health facilities, instead of trying to take the rights from our people, said another sheriff.

The states attorney general, Democrat Phil Weiser, has called officials to leave office if they cant follow the law.

If a sheriff cannot follow the law, the sheriff cannot do his or her job, Weiser said. The right thing to do for a sheriff who says, I cant follow the law is to resign.

Interestingly, after being pressed by the media, Governor Polis has distanced himself from Weisers remarks by saying police can exercise their discretion when choosing to honor the new law.

Every law enforcement agency has limited resources, and they do have to prioritize what they choose to enforce or not enforce, said Polis.
