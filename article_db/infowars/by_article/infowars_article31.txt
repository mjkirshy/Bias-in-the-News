The BBC was ordered to pay damages after the far-left outlet published fake news claiming Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko authorized an illegal payment of $400,000 to Michael Cohen for additional face time during a June 2017 meeting with President Trump.

We apologize to Mr. Poroshenko for any distress caused and have agreed to pay him damages, legal costs and have participated in a joint statement in open court, the BBCs said in a written apology published Thursday.

In the May 2018 piece, the disgraced BBC made the absurd claim that Poroshenko, who already had a meeting set up with Trump, paid this $400,000 to extend the meeting.

Think about how well this utterly deranged piece of fake news fits into the overall medias Russia Collusion Hoax.

Poroshenko is an aggressive opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin, so naturally the only way he could get serious face time with Trump (aka Putins Stooge) is through a six-figure bribe. Michael Cohen was still the presidents personal lawyer at this time, which means the media were desperate for us to see Cohen as Trumps world-traveling bagman, because that would lend credibility to the phony dossiers lie about Cohen visiting Prague to pay off the hackers who got Hillarys emails. The story openly insinuates Trump is both in Putins pocket and accepting bribes.
