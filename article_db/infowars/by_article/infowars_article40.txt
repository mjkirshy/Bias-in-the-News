Congressional Democrats are displaying Transgender Equality flags outside their offices in protest of the so-called military trans ban proposed by the Trump administration.

The National Center for Transgender Awareness announced that the flags had been delivered to every member of Congress as part of Trans Visibility Week.

To mark this years Trans Visibility Week, weve done something UNPRECEDENTED: With the help of community members & volunteers, we delivered trans pride flags to EVERY member of the Congress, from every party, including voting members and non-voting delegates, the group tweeted. Our request: Fly them outside your office for Trans Visibility Week.

Many Democrats have complied, sharing photographs to social media calling the military policy hateful and an act of bigotry.

House Democrats passed a non-binding resolution opposing the partial ban on transgender military personnel this week. Only five House Republicans joined them.

The Supreme Court has ruled the restrictions can be implemented, however transgender troops will reportedly be allowed to serve if they do so as their biological sex, and other transgender personnel already serving will be grandfathered in.

A Smithsonian poll published in January revealed only 39% of active and retired servicepeople supported transgenders serving in the military.



This is a compilation of videos and newscasts showing the dark intentions to Drag Queen Story Hour programs that are sprouting up across America.
