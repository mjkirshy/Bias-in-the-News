Attorney General William Barr wrote a Friday letter in response to Senate Judiciary Chair Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) notifying them that a redacted copy of the Mueller report will be delivered to Congress, then available to the public, by mid-April if not sooner.

Everyone will soon be able to read it on their own, wrote Barr.

Barr says that his office is working with Special Counsel Robert Mueller to redact sensitive information which could affect ongoing matters, infringe on someones personal privacy or information which could compromise the DOJs sources and methods of investigation.

The report will be nearly 400 pages, while Barr writes that there is no plans to let the White House review it beforehand.

Although the president would have the right to assert privilege over certain parts of the report, he has stated publicly that he intends to defer to me and, accordingly, there are no plans to submit the report to the White House for a privilege review.

Barr also disputes the characterization that a four-page letter released on Sunday was a summary of Muellers report.

My March 24 letter was not, and did not purport to be, an exhaustive recounting of the Special Counsels investigation or report, writes Barr. As my letter made clear, my notification to Congress and the public provided, pending release of the report, a summary of its principal conclusions  that is, its bottom line. The Special Counsels report is nearly 400 pages long (exclusive of tables and appendices) and sets forth the Special Counsels findings, his analysis, and the reasons for his conclusions. . . . I do not believe it would be in the publics interest for me to attempt to summarize the full report or to release it in serial or piecemeal fashion.

Barr then says he will be available to testify in front of Congress on May 1 and 2.
