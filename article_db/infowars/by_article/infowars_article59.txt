The Top 5 Reasons You Need Nascent Iodine



Iodine is an essential mineral that supports thyroid health and well-being for the body. *

Nascent iodine may support healthy iodine levels to supercharge cognitive functions. *

Nascent iodine may support healthy hormone levels to stabilize your vitality. *

Nascent iodine may be involved in maintaining healthy metabolism to keep you going as long as necessary.* Supplementing with pure nascent iodine may help your body reach optimal iodine levels so you don't have to reach it from impure sources.*



Survival Shield X-2 Quality



Survival Shield X-2 is manufactured in a state-licensed facility that meets federal regulatory standards, is cGMP/HACCP-compliant, and lab grade. Raw elemental iodine is a controlled substance both at a State and Federal level, and Survival Shield X-2 meets all requirements in controlling it. The licensing, approvals and regulatory documentary procedures are exacting and costly, but worth it for our consumers.



Bound forms of iodine must first be separated, clarified and purified from other binding components or impurities into a USP-grade (United States Pharmaceutical), mono-elemental iodine as certified USP resublimated iodine crystals. In this purified crystal form, iodine is a highly reactive and toxic substance. However, when the purified USP iodine crystals are subjected to a proprietary process it becomes nano-colloidalized and transforms into a form of elemental nascent iodine, also referred to as monoatomic iodine, without the addition of iodides!



Shocking Statistics About Iodine



According to the World Health Organization's Department o f Nutrition for Health and Development, iodine deficiency is a public health problem in 54 countries where impure iodine sources are plentiful.

The CDC states that iodine deficiency is one of the four major deficiency diseases in the world (Thankfully, it is easily corrected).

The 2013 USGS iodine commodity summary warns that there are no comparable substitutes for iodine that will match it's benefits.

Information published by UNICEF notes that iodine deficiency is the most avoidable cause of stunted physical and intellectual development.
