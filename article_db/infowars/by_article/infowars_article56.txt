An Austin American-Statesman investigation found an altercation between Alex Jones and customers at a Lucys Fried Chicken restaurant began when the customers approached Jones table as he sat dining.

Speaking to a Lucys employee, The Statesmans Jonathan Tilove discovered Jones was not responsible for initiating the confrontation which went viral over the weekend.

An employee with Lucys told the American-Statesman that Jones, a regular customer, was in the inside seating area of the eatery off South Congress Avenue when some other customers approached his table with insults, Tilove reported Thursday.

On Saturday, Jones and his wife were having oysters at Lucys when a group of leftists spotted and began berating him.

Jones initially ignored the insults, among which leftists shouted, Fuck you, fuck your family! and Eat shit Alex Jones, youre gonna get it, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!

Videos that emerged of the event begin with Jones holding his phone up to film a group of patrons as they chant protest slogans at him.

Jones maintained the footage did not show the full context and was deceptively edited.

They baited me like a matador does with a bull and then when I open the door, theyre all waiting with their cameras going and then edited it deceptively, because it didnt look right because showing them chanting obscenities at me would have ruined their narrative, Jones told Infowars.

Heres raw footage of the incident, corroborating Jones version of events.
