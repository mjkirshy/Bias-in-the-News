The United States will no longer provide foreign aid to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, the State Department announced Saturday.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has ordered the State Department to cut off all aid to the three nations – collectively known as the Northern Triangle – for their failure to address the waves of caravans traveling to the U.S. southern border.

“At the Secretary’s instruction, we are carrying out the President’s direction and ending FY 2017 and FY 2018 foreign assistance programs for the Northern Triangle. We will be engaging Congress as part of this process,” a State Department spokesperson said in a statement.

President Trump warned reporters Friday that he may shut down the southern border over Mexico’s failure to stop “massive caravans” coming from the Northern Triangle.

“We have right now two big caravans coming up from Guatemala, massive caravans, walking right through Mexico,” Trump said. “So Mexico is tough, they can stop them. And if they don’t stop them, we’re closing the border.”

President Trump: "Massive caravans walking right through Mexico. So Mexico's tough. They can stop them but they chose not to. Now they're going to stop them. And if they don't stop them, we're closing the border. We'll keep it closed for a long time, I'm not playing games." pic.twitter.com/xOZI1e6Oe9 — The Hill (@thehill) March 29, 2019

“We were paying them tremendous amounts of money. And we’re not paying them anymore. Because they haven’t done a thing for us. They set up these caravans,” he added.

Mexico warned the U.S. that the “mother of all caravans” comprised of nearly 20,000 people has formed and is making its way to the border.

“We have information that a new caravan is forming in Honduras, that they’re calling ‘the mother of all caravans,’ and they are thinking it could have more than 20,000 people,” Mexico’s Interior Secretary Olga Sanchez Cordero said Wednesday.

Officials reportedly did not say how much money would be withheld by the order.

“Between last year and this year, about $1.3 billion was allocated to the region with the vast majority of it going to those three countries, according to a study from the Congressional Research Service,” CNN reported.

Alex Jones presents a report produced by CNN where Latino voters living along the border in Texas make it completely clear that they want the wall, and in fact, they want it taller and longer than its current construction.

Facebook ‘accidentally’ deleted old posts by CEO Mark Zuckerberg during pivotal periods in the company’s history, reports Business Insider.

Zuck’s old posts – which were even reported on by news outlets at the time – have vanished, including every comment he made in 2007 and 2008.

“The most drastic deletions involved entire years. Throughout both 2006 and 2009, Zuckerberg was regularly active on the social network — but there are no posts visible of any kind for the two full years in between. The spokesperson confirmed that all the posts during 2007 and 2008 were deleted.” -Business Insider

The company says the posts were “mistakenly deleted” due to “technical errors.”

“A few years ago some of Mark’s posts were mistakenly deleted due to technical errors. The work required to restore them would have been extensive and not guaranteed to be successful so we didn’t do it,” reads a statement by a spokesperson.

“We agree people should be able to find information about past announcements and major company news, which is why for years we’ve shared and archived this information publicly — first on our blog and in recent years on our Newsroom.”

“These disappearances, along with other changes Facebook has made to how it saves its archive of announcements and blog posts, make it much harder to parse the social network’s historical record. This makes it far more difficult to hold the company, and Zuckerberg himself, accountable to past statements — particularly during a period of intense scrutiny of the company in the wake of a string of scandals.”

“The very nature of the issue means it is extremely challenging to make a full accounting of what exactly what has gone missing over the years. The spokesperson said they didn’t know how many posts in total were deleted.” -Business Insider

One such deleted post which was widely reported (and now no longer works) was an important document in Facebook’s history, as Zuckerberg promised during the April 2012 acquisition of Instagram that “we’re committed to building and growing Instagram independently,” – a commitment the company never stuck to, while Instagram’s two co-founders departed last year amid clashes with the 34-year-old billionaire CEO.

Harder to search the archives

According to the report, Facebook has also made it more difficult to navigate its dedicated announcement blog – after launching their new “Newsroom” for key announcements – the ability to search for old posts has all but been disabled.

“Now, when you click on a link to a blog post included in an old news story, it redirects you to the Newsroom. The Newsroom doesn’t have copies of many of these old blog posts, meaning there’s no easy way to access them.”

“They do still exist in one form — as a “note” saved to Facebook’s public “Facebook” page on the social network. But until today there was no centralized archive through which to browse them, like what was available for the Facebook blog, or like what exists today for Newsroom posts.”

“Instead, to read a specific one, you had to either know about it already and search for keywords on Google, or scroll back through the Facebook page’s thousands of posts over the years”. -Business Insider

Facebook added a “notes” tab to the Facebook page to access the old entries after BI contacted them for the story – which notes that “The net effect of this change to the archives was to drastically obfuscate Facebook’s historical record — making it far harder to find past statements and announcements from the company about itself.”

In April 2018, controversy erupted when TechCrunch reported that messages sent by Zuckerberg were being deleted in other people’s inboxes without their knowledge or consent. The feature was not available to other users at the time.

Meanwhile The Verge noted in November 2016 that Zuckerberg’s public posts about the media and Facebook’s role in the 2016 US election had disappeared.

The volume of censorship now taking place in America is unprecedented as well as ominous. Alex explains that now is the time for patriots to stand up before Big Tech fully turns America into China.

Freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) on Friday blamed an anonymous staffer for the early rollout of the Green New Deal FAQ, which was widely-mocked for saying there would be a guarantee of economic security even for those “unwilling to work” and calling for the elimination of “farting cows.”

During a town hall that aired on MSNBC Friday night, Ocasio-Cortez was asked by host Chris Hayes whether she thought that office rolled out the Green New Deal the right way.

“What I will say is that I definitely had a staffer that had a very bad day at work and did release a working draft early, so I get that that’s what they are seizing on,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “Really what we need to do is have a serious conversation and even in those draft versions what they were talking about is really about the fact that we need to innovate on technology.”

She went on to reference “cow flatulence,” prompting Hayes to interject, “It sounds ridiculous, but it literally is an issue.”

Attorney General William Barr is a “stooge” for President Trump coordinating “a high-tech coup” by announcing that Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report found no collusion, said late night host Bill Maher.

On Friday’s HBO show “Real Time,” Maher accused “dictator” Trump of hiring Barr for the sole purpose of being exonerated by him.

“You know, high-tech lynching. Remember that phrase? This is like a high-tech coup,” Maher told his guest panel. “I know Barr is an esteemed person, William Barr. He’s a stooge. This is what Third World countries do. The dictator appoints somebody who exonerates him. That’s what happened here.”

Additionally, Maher said, Barr’s announcement last week was simply to provide cover for Trump when Mueller’s full report is released a few weeks later when the true nature of the collusion is revealed.

“I think the whole point of what Barr did was to give Trump a month-long lead to get out there and do the end zone dance, put the bullshit out, I’m completely exonerated. Because then, when we come up with the other stuff, it’s a month later, and then we’re like undoing something.”

Barr released a 4-page summary last weekend outlining Mueller’s main findings, which concluded the Trump campaign did not collude with Russia and Trump did not obstruct justice during the course of the “investigation.”

Alex Jones presents video footage of Texas Representative Mike Conaway calling out California Representative Adam Schiff on the house floor for his open participation in pushing propaganda on the American public that suggested President Trump colluded with the Russian Government in 2016.

Media companies are refusing to air advertisements for an anti-abortion movie that criticizes the practices of Planned Parenthood.

The Hallmark Channel, Lifetime, and media properties owned by the Discovery conglomerate are among the organizations that rejected the movie’s advertisements. The movie’s producers says that Fox News Channel is the only mainstream media outlet to have accepted its advertisements.

The movie, “Unplanned,” premiered in 1,000 movie theaters across the nation. Pure Flix, the production company behind the film, primarily targets Christian and social conservative audiences. Its feature “God’s Not Dead” grossed over $62 million on a $2 million budget, according to box office releases in 2014.

President Donald Trump on Friday called on The Washington Post and New York Times to be stripped of Pulitzer Prizes that the newspapers received last year for reporting on Russiagate.

So funny that The New York Times & The Washington Post got a Pulitzer Prize for their coverage (100% NEGATIVE and FAKE!) of Collusion with Russia – And there was No Collusion! So, they were either duped or corrupt? In any event, their prizes should be taken away by the Committee! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2019

The Post and Times shared the 2018 Pulitzer for a series of reports on developments in the Russia investigation.

Many of the core allegations in the reports were undercut with the recent revelation that special counsel Robert Mueller did not find collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian government.

“The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities,” Mueller wrote in his 400-page report, according to Attorney General William Barr. (RELATED: Mueller: No Collusion)

According to Barr, Mueller also did not establish “that any U.S. person or Trump campaign official or associate” conspired or “knowingly coordinated” with Russian efforts to use social media platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 campaign or to hack Democrats’ emails and disseminate them online.

On Sunday, after Barr released the summary of Mueller’s findings, Donald Trump Jr. also blasted The Post and Times over their award-winning reports.

They should convert those Pulitzer’s to #fakenews awards. How do you win a reporting award for reporting fake news? There should be a recall. Those Pulitzer’s were earned like Liz Warren’s tenure. https://t.co/5Bak6VTQ5G — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) March 24, 2019

In announcing the awards in April 2018, the Pulitzer committee praised the Post and Times’ Russia reporting.

The Post and Times received the award “for deeply sourced, relentlessly reported coverage in the public interest that dramatically furthered the nation’s understanding of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and its connections to the Trump campaign, the President-elect’s transition team and his eventual administration,” the committee said.

None of the 20 stories cited by the Pulitzer committee have come under particular scrutiny. But most furthered the narrative of collusion between the Trump team and Russia.

President Trump gave a rousing speech in Michigan where he went on offense against the MSM and the Deep State. Alex Jones gives his take on the future for President Trump’s America first agenda.

Former President Barack Obama’s DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson said Thursday that the U.S. is “truly in a crisis” at the southern border.

“A little bit of context here. When I was in office in Kirstjen Nielsen’s job, at her desk, I’d get to work around 6:30 in the morning, and there would be my intelligence book sitting on my desk, the PDB, and also the apprehension numbers from the day before,” Johnson said during his appearance on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.”

“My staff would tell you if it was under 1,000 apprehension the day before, that was a relatively good number, and if it was above 1,000, it was a relatively bad number, and I was going to be in a bad mood the whole day.”

“On Tuesday there were 4,000 apprehensions. I know that a thousand overwhelms the system. I can’t imagine what 4,000 a day looks like. So, we are truly in a crisis,” he continued.

A caravan migrant from Honduras who complained about being given beans to eat during her journey through Mexico is now in a Texas jail facing one charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.

The woman became the topic of a viral video during her journey. The woman’s sister is also facing similar charges and both have an immigration detainer placed on them preventing them from bonding out.

Jail records from Dallas County jail revealed that Mirian Zelaya and Mirna Zelaya are both being held in a detention center on a charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.

While jail records do not reveal the details that led to the charge, the news outlet Mundo Hispanico revealed that the two women allegedly beat another woman who was providing them with housing.

President Donald Trump is threatening to close parts of the U.S.-Mexican border as record numbers of migrants surge through the legal loopholes created by Congress and judges.

“CONGRESS MUST CHANGE OUR WEAK IMMIGRATION LAWS NOW … If Mexico doesn’t immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States throug [sic] our Southern Border, I will be CLOSING….. ….the Border, or large sections of the Border, next week,” he said in a series of three tweets Friday morning.

The DEMOCRATS have given us the weakest immigration laws anywhere in the World. Mexico has the strongest, & they make more than $100 Billion a year on the U.S. Therefore, CONGRESS MUST CHANGE OUR WEAK IMMIGRATION LAWS NOW, & Mexico must stop illegals from entering the U.S…. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2019

….the Border, or large sections of the Border, next week. This would be so easy for Mexico to do, but they just take our money and “talk.” Besides, we lose so much money with them, especially when you add in drug trafficking etc.), that the Border closing would be a good thing! — Donald J.

Border officials are ramping up their estimates for the number of migrants who will grab the opportunity created by Congress. Predictions for 2019 have climbed from 900,000 to 1.2 million during the last few weeks.

If Mexico doesn’t immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States throug our Southern Border, I will be CLOSING….. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2019

….the Border, or large sections of the Border, next week. This would be so easy for Mexico to do, but they just take our money and “talk.” Besides, we lose so much money with them, especially when you add in drug trafficking etc.), that the Border closing would be a good thing! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2019

Border officials are ramping up their estimates for the number of migrants who will grab the opportunity created by Congress. Predictions for 2019 have climbed from 900,000 to 1.2 million during the last few weeks.

Alex Jones breaks down how, according to the commissioner of Customs & Border Protection, America’s immigration system is at a breaking point as illegal aliens flood across the border and the government releases them into American cities as catch and release thrives. This is the UN’s plan to break our southern border.The United States will no longer provide foreign aid to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, the State Department announced Saturday.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has ordered the State Department to cut off all aid to the three nations – collectively known as the Northern Triangle – for their failure to address the waves of caravans traveling to the U.S. southern border.

“At the Secretary’s instruction, we are carrying out the President’s direction and ending FY 2017 and FY 2018 foreign assistance programs for the Northern Triangle. We will be engaging Congress as part of this process,” a State Department spokesperson said in a statement.

President Trump warned reporters Friday that he may shut down the southern border over Mexico’s failure to stop “massive caravans” coming from the Northern Triangle.

“We have right now two big caravans coming up from Guatemala, massive caravans, walking right through Mexico,” Trump said. “So Mexico is tough, they can stop them. And if they don’t stop them, we’re closing the border.”

President Trump: "Massive caravans walking right through Mexico. So Mexico's tough. They can stop them but they chose not to. Now they're going to stop them. And if they don't stop them, we're closing the border. We'll keep it closed for a long time, I'm not playing games." pic.twitter.com/xOZI1e6Oe9 — The Hill (@thehill) March 29, 2019

“We were paying them tremendous amounts of money. And we’re not paying them anymore. Because they haven’t done a thing for us. They set up these caravans,” he added.

Mexico warned the U.S. that the “mother of all caravans” comprised of nearly 20,000 people has formed and is making its way to the border.

“We have information that a new caravan is forming in Honduras, that they’re calling ‘the mother of all caravans,’ and they are thinking it could have more than 20,000 people,” Mexico’s Interior Secretary Olga Sanchez Cordero said Wednesday.

Officials reportedly did not say how much money would be withheld by the order.

“Between last year and this year, about $1.3 billion was allocated to the region with the vast majority of it going to those three countries, according to a study from the Congressional Research Service,” CNN reported.

Alex Jones presents a report produced by CNN where Latino voters living along the border in Texas make it completely clear that they want the wall, and in fact, they want it taller and longer than its current construction.

Facebook ‘accidentally’ deleted old posts by CEO Mark Zuckerberg during pivotal periods in the company’s history, reports Business Insider.

Zuck’s old posts – which were even reported on by news outlets at the time – have vanished, including every comment he made in 2007 and 2008.

“The most drastic deletions involved entire years. Throughout both 2006 and 2009, Zuckerberg was regularly active on the social network — but there are no posts visible of any kind for the two full years in between. The spokesperson confirmed that all the posts during 2007 and 2008 were deleted.” -Business Insider

The company says the posts were “mistakenly deleted” due to “technical errors.”

“A few years ago some of Mark’s posts were mistakenly deleted due to technical errors. The work required to restore them would have been extensive and not guaranteed to be successful so we didn’t do it,” reads a statement by a spokesperson.

“We agree people should be able to find information about past announcements and major company news, which is why for years we’ve shared and archived this information publicly — first on our blog and in recent years on our Newsroom.”

“These disappearances, along with other changes Facebook has made to how it saves its archive of announcements and blog posts, make it much harder to parse the social network’s historical record. This makes it far more difficult to hold the company, and Zuckerberg himself, accountable to past statements — particularly during a period of intense scrutiny of the company in the wake of a string of scandals.”

“The very nature of the issue means it is extremely challenging to make a full accounting of what exactly what has gone missing over the years. The spokesperson said they didn’t know how many posts in total were deleted.” -Business Insider

One such deleted post which was widely reported (and now no longer works) was an important document in Facebook’s history, as Zuckerberg promised during the April 2012 acquisition of Instagram that “we’re committed to building and growing Instagram independently,” – a commitment the company never stuck to, while Instagram’s two co-founders departed last year amid clashes with the 34-year-old billionaire CEO.

Harder to search the archives

According to the report, Facebook has also made it more difficult to navigate its dedicated announcement blog – after launching their new “Newsroom” for key announcements – the ability to search for old posts has all but been disabled.

“Now, when you click on a link to a blog post included in an old news story, it redirects you to the Newsroom. The Newsroom doesn’t have copies of many of these old blog posts, meaning there’s no easy way to access them.”

“They do still exist in one form — as a “note” saved to Facebook’s public “Facebook” page on the social network. But until today there was no centralized archive through which to browse them, like what was available for the Facebook blog, or like what exists today for Newsroom posts.”

“Instead, to read a specific one, you had to either know about it already and search for keywords on Google, or scroll back through the Facebook page’s thousands of posts over the years”. -Business Insider

Facebook added a “notes” tab to the Facebook page to access the old entries after BI contacted them for the story – which notes that “The net effect of this change to the archives was to drastically obfuscate Facebook’s historical record — making it far harder to find past statements and announcements from the company about itself.”

In April 2018, controversy erupted when TechCrunch reported that messages sent by Zuckerberg were being deleted in other people’s inboxes without their knowledge or consent. The feature was not available to other users at the time.

Meanwhile The Verge noted in November 2016 that Zuckerberg’s public posts about the media and Facebook’s role in the 2016 US election had disappeared.

The volume of censorship now taking place in America is unprecedented as well as ominous. Alex explains that now is the time for patriots to stand up before Big Tech fully turns America into China.

Freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) on Friday blamed an anonymous staffer for the early rollout of the Green New Deal FAQ, which was widely-mocked for saying there would be a guarantee of economic security even for those “unwilling to work” and calling for the elimination of “farting cows.”

During a town hall that aired on MSNBC Friday night, Ocasio-Cortez was asked by host Chris Hayes whether she thought that office rolled out the Green New Deal the right way.

“What I will say is that I definitely had a staffer that had a very bad day at work and did release a working draft early, so I get that that’s what they are seizing on,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “Really what we need to do is have a serious conversation and even in those draft versions what they were talking about is really about the fact that we need to innovate on technology.”

She went on to reference “cow flatulence,” prompting Hayes to interject, “It sounds ridiculous, but it literally is an issue.”

Attorney General William Barr is a “stooge” for President Trump coordinating “a high-tech coup” by announcing that Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report found no collusion, said late night host Bill Maher.

On Friday’s HBO show “Real Time,” Maher accused “dictator” Trump of hiring Barr for the sole purpose of being exonerated by him.

“You know, high-tech lynching. Remember that phrase? This is like a high-tech coup,” Maher told his guest panel. “I know Barr is an esteemed person, William Barr. He’s a stooge. This is what Third World countries do. The dictator appoints somebody who exonerates him. That’s what happened here.”

Additionally, Maher said, Barr’s announcement last week was simply to provide cover for Trump when Mueller’s full report is released a few weeks later when the true nature of the collusion is revealed.

“I think the whole point of what Barr did was to give Trump a month-long lead to get out there and do the end zone dance, put the bullshit out, I’m completely exonerated. Because then, when we come up with the other stuff, it’s a month later, and then we’re like undoing something.”

Barr released a 4-page summary last weekend outlining Mueller’s main findings, which concluded the Trump campaign did not collude with Russia and Trump did not obstruct justice during the course of the “investigation.”

Alex Jones presents video footage of Texas Representative Mike Conaway calling out California Representative Adam Schiff on the house floor for his open participation in pushing propaganda on the American public that suggested President Trump colluded with the Russian Government in 2016.

Media companies are refusing to air advertisements for an anti-abortion movie that criticizes the practices of Planned Parenthood.

The Hallmark Channel, Lifetime, and media properties owned by the Discovery conglomerate are among the organizations that rejected the movie’s advertisements. The movie’s producers says that Fox News Channel is the only mainstream media outlet to have accepted its advertisements.

The movie, “Unplanned,” premiered in 1,000 movie theaters across the nation. Pure Flix, the production company behind the film, primarily targets Christian and social conservative audiences. Its feature “God’s Not Dead” grossed over $62 million on a $2 million budget, according to box office releases in 2014.

President Donald Trump on Friday called on The Washington Post and New York Times to be stripped of Pulitzer Prizes that the newspapers received last year for reporting on Russiagate.

So funny that The New York Times & The Washington Post got a Pulitzer Prize for their coverage (100% NEGATIVE and FAKE!) of Collusion with Russia – And there was No Collusion! So, they were either duped or corrupt? In any event, their prizes should be taken away by the Committee! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2019

The Post and Times shared the 2018 Pulitzer for a series of reports on developments in the Russia investigation.

Many of the core allegations in the reports were undercut with the recent revelation that special counsel Robert Mueller did not find collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian government.

“The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities,” Mueller wrote in his 400-page report, according to Attorney General William Barr. (RELATED: Mueller: No Collusion)

According to Barr, Mueller also did not establish “that any U.S. person or Trump campaign official or associate” conspired or “knowingly coordinated” with Russian efforts to use social media platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 campaign or to hack Democrats’ emails and disseminate them online.

On Sunday, after Barr released the summary of Mueller’s findings, Donald Trump Jr. also blasted The Post and Times over their award-winning reports.

They should convert those Pulitzer’s to #fakenews awards. How do you win a reporting award for reporting fake news? There should be a recall. Those Pulitzer’s were earned like Liz Warren’s tenure. https://t.co/5Bak6VTQ5G — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) March 24, 2019

In announcing the awards in April 2018, the Pulitzer committee praised the Post and Times’ Russia reporting.

The Post and Times received the award “for deeply sourced, relentlessly reported coverage in the public interest that dramatically furthered the nation’s understanding of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and its connections to the Trump campaign, the President-elect’s transition team and his eventual administration,” the committee said.

None of the 20 stories cited by the Pulitzer committee have come under particular scrutiny. But most furthered the narrative of collusion between the Trump team and Russia.

President Trump gave a rousing speech in Michigan where he went on offense against the MSM and the Deep State. Alex Jones gives his take on the future for President Trump’s America first agenda.

Former President Barack Obama’s DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson said Thursday that the U.S. is “truly in a crisis” at the southern border.

“A little bit of context here. When I was in office in Kirstjen Nielsen’s job, at her desk, I’d get to work around 6:30 in the morning, and there would be my intelligence book sitting on my desk, the PDB, and also the apprehension numbers from the day before,” Johnson said during his appearance on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.”

“My staff would tell you if it was under 1,000 apprehension the day before, that was a relatively good number, and if it was above 1,000, it was a relatively bad number, and I was going to be in a bad mood the whole day.”

“On Tuesday there were 4,000 apprehensions. I know that a thousand overwhelms the system. I can’t imagine what 4,000 a day looks like. So, we are truly in a crisis,” he continued.

A caravan migrant from Honduras who complained about being given beans to eat during her journey through Mexico is now in a Texas jail facing one charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.

The woman became the topic of a viral video during her journey. The woman’s sister is also facing similar charges and both have an immigration detainer placed on them preventing them from bonding out.

Jail records from Dallas County jail revealed that Mirian Zelaya and Mirna Zelaya are both being held in a detention center on a charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.

President Donald Trump is threatening to close parts of the U.S.-Mexican border as record numbers of migrants surge through the legal loopholes created by Congress and judges.

“CONGRESS MUST CHANGE OUR WEAK IMMIGRATION LAWS NOW … If Mexico doesn’t immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States throug [sic] our Southern Border, I will be CLOSING….. ….the Border, or large sections of the Border, next week,” he said in a series of three tweets Friday morning.

The DEMOCRATS have given us the weakest immigration laws anywhere in the World. Mexico has the strongest, & they make more than $100 Billion a year on the U.S. Therefore, CONGRESS MUST CHANGE OUR WEAK IMMIGRATION LAWS NOW, & Mexico must stop illegals from entering the U.S…. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2019

….the Border, or large sections of the Border, next week. This would be so easy for Mexico to do, but they just take our money and “talk.” Besides, we lose so much money with them, especially when you add in drug trafficking etc.), that the Border closing would be a good thing! — Donald J.

Alex Jones breaks down how, according to the commissioner of Customs & Border Protection, America’s immigration system is at a breaking point as illegal aliens flood across the border and the government releases them into American cities as catch and release thrives. This is the UN’s plan to break our southern border.


President Donald Trump is threatening to close parts of the U.S.-Mexican border as record numbers of migrants surge through the legal loopholes created by Congress and judges.

“CONGRESS MUST CHANGE OUR WEAK IMMIGRATION LAWS NOW … If Mexico doesn’t immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States throug [sic] our Southern Border, I will be CLOSING….. ….the Border, or large sections of the Border, next week,” he said in a series of three tweets Friday morning.

The DEMOCRATS have given us the weakest immigration laws anywhere in the World. Mexico has the strongest, & they make more than $100 Billion a year on the U.S. Therefore, CONGRESS MUST CHANGE OUR WEAK IMMIGRATION LAWS NOW, & Mexico must stop illegals from entering the U.S…. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2019

….through their country and our Southern Border. Mexico has for many years made a fortune off of the U.S., far greater than Border Costs. If Mexico doesn’t immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States throug our Southern Border, I will be CLOSING….. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2019

….the Border, or large sections of the Border, next week. This would be so easy for Mexico to do, but they just take our money and “talk.” Besides, we lose so much money with them, especially when you add in drug trafficking etc.), that the Border closing would be a good thing! — Donald J.

Alex Jones breaks down how, according to the commissioner of Customs & Border Protection, America’s immigration system is at a breaking point as illegal aliens flood across the border and the government releases them into American cities as catch and release thrives. This is the UN’s plan to break our southern border.The United States will no longer provide foreign aid to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, the State Department announced Saturday.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has ordered the State Department to cut off all aid to the three nations – collectively known as the Northern Triangle – for their failure to address the waves of caravans traveling to the U.S. southern border.

“At the Secretary’s instruction, we are carrying out the President’s direction and ending FY 2017 and FY 2018 foreign assistance programs for the Northern Triangle. We will be engaging Congress as part of this process,” a State Department spokesperson said in a statement.

President Trump warned reporters Friday that he may shut down the southern border over Mexico’s failure to stop “massive caravans” coming from the Northern Triangle.

“We have right now two big caravans coming up from Guatemala, massive caravans, walking right through Mexico,” Trump said. “So Mexico is tough, they can stop them. And if they don’t stop them, we’re closing the border.”

President Trump: "Massive caravans walking right through Mexico. So Mexico's tough. They can stop them but they chose not to. Now they're going to stop them. And if they don't stop them, we're closing the border. We'll keep it closed for a long time, I'm not playing games." pic.twitter.com/xOZI1e6Oe9 — The Hill (@thehill) March 29, 2019

“We were paying them tremendous amounts of money. And we’re not paying them anymore. Because they haven’t done a thing for us. They set up these caravans,” he added.

Mexico warned the U.S. that the “mother of all caravans” comprised of nearly 20,000 people has formed and is making its way to the border.

“We have information that a new caravan is forming in Honduras, that they’re calling ‘the mother of all caravans,’ and they are thinking it could have more than 20,000 people,” Mexico’s Interior Secretary Olga Sanchez Cordero said Wednesday.

Officials reportedly did not say how much money would be withheld by the order.

“Between last year and this year, about $1.3 billion was allocated to the region with the vast majority of it going to those three countries, according to a study from the Congressional Research Service,” CNN reported.

Alex Jones presents a report produced by CNN where Latino voters living along the border in Texas make it completely clear that they want the wall, and in fact, they want it taller and longer than its current construction.

Facebook ‘accidentally’ deleted old posts by CEO Mark Zuckerberg during pivotal periods in the company’s history, reports Business Insider.

Zuck’s old posts – which were even reported on by news outlets at the time – have vanished, including every comment he made in 2007 and 2008.

“The most drastic deletions involved entire years. Throughout both 2006 and 2009, Zuckerberg was regularly active on the social network — but there are no posts visible of any kind for the two full years in between. The spokesperson confirmed that all the posts during 2007 and 2008 were deleted.” -Business Insider

The company says the posts were “mistakenly deleted” due to “technical errors.”

“A few years ago some of Mark’s posts were mistakenly deleted due to technical errors. The work required to restore them would have been extensive and not guaranteed to be successful so we didn’t do it,” reads a statement by a spokesperson.

“We agree people should be able to find information about past announcements and major company news, which is why for years we’ve shared and archived this information publicly — first on our blog and in recent years on our Newsroom.”

“These disappearances, along with other changes Facebook has made to how it saves its archive of announcements and blog posts, make it much harder to parse the social network’s historical record. This makes it far more difficult to hold the company, and Zuckerberg himself, accountable to past statements — particularly during a period of intense scrutiny of the company in the wake of a string of scandals.”

“The very nature of the issue means it is extremely challenging to make a full accounting of what exactly what has gone missing over the years. The spokesperson said they didn’t know how many posts in total were deleted.” -Business Insider

One such deleted post which was widely reported (and now no longer works) was an important document in Facebook’s history, as Zuckerberg promised during the April 2012 acquisition of Instagram that “we’re committed to building and growing Instagram independently,” – a commitment the company never stuck to, while Instagram’s two co-founders departed last year amid clashes with the 34-year-old billionaire CEO.

Harder to search the archives

According to the report, Facebook has also made it more difficult to navigate its dedicated announcement blog – after launching their new “Newsroom” for key announcements – the ability to search for old posts has all but been disabled.

“Now, when you click on a link to a blog post included in an old news story, it redirects you to the Newsroom. The Newsroom doesn’t have copies of many of these old blog posts, meaning there’s no easy way to access them.”

“They do still exist in one form — as a “note” saved to Facebook’s public “Facebook” page on the social network. But until today there was no centralized archive through which to browse them, like what was available for the Facebook blog, or like what exists today for Newsroom posts.”

“Instead, to read a specific one, you had to either know about it already and search for keywords on Google, or scroll back through the Facebook page’s thousands of posts over the years”. -Business Insider

Facebook added a “notes” tab to the Facebook page to access the old entries after BI contacted them for the story – which notes that “The net effect of this change to the archives was to drastically obfuscate Facebook’s historical record — making it far harder to find past statements and announcements from the company about itself.”

In April 2018, controversy erupted when TechCrunch reported that messages sent by Zuckerberg were being deleted in other people’s inboxes without their knowledge or consent. The feature was not available to other users at the time.

Meanwhile The Verge noted in November 2016 that Zuckerberg’s public posts about the media and Facebook’s role in the 2016 US election had disappeared.

The volume of censorship now taking place in America is unprecedented as well as ominous. Alex explains that now is the time for patriots to stand up before Big Tech fully turns America into China.

Freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) on Friday blamed an anonymous staffer for the early rollout of the Green New Deal FAQ, which was widely-mocked for saying there would be a guarantee of economic security even for those “unwilling to work” and calling for the elimination of “farting cows.”

During a town hall that aired on MSNBC Friday night, Ocasio-Cortez was asked by host Chris Hayes whether she thought that office rolled out the Green New Deal the right way.

“What I will say is that I definitely had a staffer that had a very bad day at work and did release a working draft early, so I get that that’s what they are seizing on,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “Really what we need to do is have a serious conversation and even in those draft versions what they were talking about is really about the fact that we need to innovate on technology.”

She went on to reference “cow flatulence,” prompting Hayes to interject, “It sounds ridiculous, but it literally is an issue.”

Attorney General William Barr is a “stooge” for President Trump coordinating “a high-tech coup” by announcing that Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report found no collusion, said late night host Bill Maher.

On Friday’s HBO show “Real Time,” Maher accused “dictator” Trump of hiring Barr for the sole purpose of being exonerated by him.

“You know, high-tech lynching. Remember that phrase? This is like a high-tech coup,” Maher told his guest panel. “I know Barr is an esteemed person, William Barr. He’s a stooge. This is what Third World countries do. The dictator appoints somebody who exonerates him. That’s what happened here.”

Additionally, Maher said, Barr’s announcement last week was simply to provide cover for Trump when Mueller’s full report is released a few weeks later when the true nature of the collusion is revealed.

“I think the whole point of what Barr did was to give Trump a month-long lead to get out there and do the end zone dance, put the bullshit out, I’m completely exonerated. Because then, when we come up with the other stuff, it’s a month later, and then we’re like undoing something.”

Barr released a 4-page summary last weekend outlining Mueller’s main findings, which concluded the Trump campaign did not collude with Russia and Trump did not obstruct justice during the course of the “investigation.”

Alex Jones presents video footage of Texas Representative Mike Conaway calling out California Representative Adam Schiff on the house floor for his open participation in pushing propaganda on the American public that suggested President Trump colluded with the Russian Government in 2016.

Media companies are refusing to air advertisements for an anti-abortion movie that criticizes the practices of Planned Parenthood.

The Hallmark Channel, Lifetime, and media properties owned by the Discovery conglomerate are among the organizations that rejected the movie’s advertisements. The movie’s producers says that Fox News Channel is the only mainstream media outlet to have accepted its advertisements.

The movie, “Unplanned,” premiered in 1,000 movie theaters across the nation. Pure Flix, the production company behind the film, primarily targets Christian and social conservative audiences. Its feature “God’s Not Dead” grossed over $62 million on a $2 million budget, according to box office releases in 2014.

President Donald Trump on Friday called on The Washington Post and New York Times to be stripped of Pulitzer Prizes that the newspapers received last year for reporting on Russiagate.

So funny that The New York Times & The Washington Post got a Pulitzer Prize for their coverage (100% NEGATIVE and FAKE!) of Collusion with Russia – And there was No Collusion! So, they were either duped or corrupt? In any event, their prizes should be taken away by the Committee! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2019

The Post and Times shared the 2018 Pulitzer for a series of reports on developments in the Russia investigation.

Many of the core allegations in the reports were undercut with the recent revelation that special counsel Robert Mueller did not find collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian government.

“The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities,” Mueller wrote in his 400-page report, according to Attorney General William Barr. (RELATED: Mueller: No Collusion)

According to Barr, Mueller also did not establish “that any U.S. person or Trump campaign official or associate” conspired or “knowingly coordinated” with Russian efforts to use social media platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 campaign or to hack Democrats’ emails and disseminate them online.

On Sunday, after Barr released the summary of Mueller’s findings, Donald Trump Jr. also blasted The Post and Times over their award-winning reports.

They should convert those Pulitzer’s to #fakenews awards. How do you win a reporting award for reporting fake news? There should be a recall. Those Pulitzer’s were earned like Liz Warren’s tenure. https://t.co/5Bak6VTQ5G — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) March 24, 2019

In announcing the awards in April 2018, the Pulitzer committee praised the Post and Times’ Russia reporting.

The Post and Times received the award “for deeply sourced, relentlessly reported coverage in the public interest that dramatically furthered the nation’s understanding of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and its connections to the Trump campaign, the President-elect’s transition team and his eventual administration,” the committee said.

None of the 20 stories cited by the Pulitzer committee have come under particular scrutiny. But most furthered the narrative of collusion between the Trump team and Russia.

President Trump gave a rousing speech in Michigan where he went on offense against the MSM and the Deep State. Alex Jones gives his take on the future for President Trump’s America first agenda.

Former President Barack Obama’s DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson said Thursday that the U.S. is “truly in a crisis” at the southern border.

“A little bit of context here. When I was in office in Kirstjen Nielsen’s job, at her desk, I’d get to work around 6:30 in the morning, and there would be my intelligence book sitting on my desk, the PDB, and also the apprehension numbers from the day before,” Johnson said during his appearance on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.”

“My staff would tell you if it was under 1,000 apprehension the day before, that was a relatively good number, and if it was above 1,000, it was a relatively bad number, and I was going to be in a bad mood the whole day.”

“On Tuesday there were 4,000 apprehensions. I know that a thousand overwhelms the system. I can’t imagine what 4,000 a day looks like. So, we are truly in a crisis,” he continued.

A caravan migrant from Honduras who complained about being given beans to eat during her journey through Mexico is now in a Texas jail facing one charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.

The woman became the topic of a viral video during her journey. The woman’s sister is also facing similar charges and both have an immigration detainer placed on them preventing them from bonding out.

Jail records from Dallas County jail revealed that Mirian Zelaya and Mirna Zelaya are both being held in a detention center on a charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.

While jail records do not reveal the details that led to the charge, the news outlet Mundo Hispanico revealed that the two women allegedly beat another woman who was providing them with housing.

President Donald Trump is threatening to close parts of the U.S.-Mexican border as record numbers of migrants surge through the legal loopholes created by Congress and judges.

“CONGRESS MUST CHANGE OUR WEAK IMMIGRATION LAWS NOW … If Mexico doesn’t immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States throug [sic] our Southern Border, I will be CLOSING….. ….the Border, or large sections of the Border, next week,” he said in a series of three tweets Friday morning.

Alex Jones breaks down how, according to the commissioner of Customs & Border Protection, America’s immigration system is at a breaking point as illegal aliens flood across the border and the government releases them into American cities as catch and release thrives. This is the UN’s plan to break our southern border.The United States will no longer provide foreign aid to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, the State Department announced Saturday.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has ordered the State Department to cut off all aid to the three nations – collectively known as the Northern Triangle – for their failure to address the waves of caravans traveling to the U.S. southern border.

“At the Secretary’s instruction, we are carrying out the President’s direction and ending FY 2017 and FY 2018 foreign assistance programs for the Northern Triangle. We will be engaging Congress as part of this process,” a State Department spokesperson said in a statement.

President Trump warned reporters Friday that he may shut down the southern border over Mexico’s failure to stop “massive caravans” coming from the Northern Triangle.

“We have right now two big caravans coming up from Guatemala, massive caravans, walking right through Mexico,” Trump said. “So Mexico is tough, they can stop them. And if they don’t stop them, we’re closing the border.”

President Trump: "Massive caravans walking right through Mexico. So Mexico's tough. They can stop them but they chose not to. Now they're going to stop them. And if they don't stop them, we're closing the border. We'll keep it closed for a long time, I'm not playing games." pic.twitter.com/xOZI1e6Oe9 — The Hill (@thehill) March 29, 2019

“We were paying them tremendous amounts of money. And we’re not paying them anymore. Because they haven’t done a thing for us. They set up these caravans,” he added.

Mexico warned the U.S. that the “mother of all caravans” comprised of nearly 20,000 people has formed and is making its way to the border.

“We have information that a new caravan is forming in Honduras, that they’re calling ‘the mother of all caravans,’ and they are thinking it could have more than 20,000 people,” Mexico’s Interior Secretary Olga Sanchez Cordero said Wednesday.

Officials reportedly did not say how much money would be withheld by the order.

“Between last year and this year, about $1.3 billion was allocated to the region with the vast majority of it going to those three countries, according to a study from the Congressional Research Service,” CNN reported.

Alex Jones presents a report produced by CNN where Latino voters living along the border in Texas make it completely clear that they want the wall, and in fact, they want it taller and longer than its current construction.

Facebook ‘accidentally’ deleted old posts by CEO Mark Zuckerberg during pivotal periods in the company’s history, reports Business Insider.

Zuck’s old posts – which were even reported on by news outlets at the time – have vanished, including every comment he made in 2007 and 2008.

“The most drastic deletions involved entire years. Throughout both 2006 and 2009, Zuckerberg was regularly active on the social network — but there are no posts visible of any kind for the two full years in between. The spokesperson confirmed that all the posts during 2007 and 2008 were deleted.” -Business Insider

The company says the posts were “mistakenly deleted” due to “technical errors.”

“A few years ago some of Mark’s posts were mistakenly deleted due to technical errors. The work required to restore them would have been extensive and not guaranteed to be successful so we didn’t do it,” reads a statement by a spokesperson.

“We agree people should be able to find information about past announcements and major company news, which is why for years we’ve shared and archived this information publicly — first on our blog and in recent years on our Newsroom.”

“These disappearances, along with other changes Facebook has made to how it saves its archive of announcements and blog posts, make it much harder to parse the social network’s historical record. This makes it far more difficult to hold the company, and Zuckerberg himself, accountable to past statements — particularly during a period of intense scrutiny of the company in the wake of a string of scandals.”

“The very nature of the issue means it is extremely challenging to make a full accounting of what exactly what has gone missing over the years. The spokesperson said they didn’t know how many posts in total were deleted.” -Business Insider

One such deleted post which was widely reported (and now no longer works) was an important document in Facebook’s history, as Zuckerberg promised during the April 2012 acquisition of Instagram that “we’re committed to building and growing Instagram independently,” – a commitment the company never stuck to, while Instagram’s two co-founders departed last year amid clashes with the 34-year-old billionaire CEO.

Harder to search the archives

According to the report, Facebook has also made it more difficult to navigate its dedicated announcement blog – after launching their new “Newsroom” for key announcements – the ability to search for old posts has all but been disabled.

“Now, when you click on a link to a blog post included in an old news story, it redirects you to the Newsroom. The Newsroom doesn’t have copies of many of these old blog posts, meaning there’s no easy way to access them.”

“They do still exist in one form — as a “note” saved to Facebook’s public “Facebook” page on the social network. But until today there was no centralized archive through which to browse them, like what was available for the Facebook blog, or like what exists today for Newsroom posts.”

“Instead, to read a specific one, you had to either know about it already and search for keywords on Google, or scroll back through the Facebook page’s thousands of posts over the years”. -Business Insider

Facebook added a “notes” tab to the Facebook page to access the old entries after BI contacted them for the story – which notes that “The net effect of this change to the archives was to drastically obfuscate Facebook’s historical record — making it far harder to find past statements and announcements from the company about itself.”

In April 2018, controversy erupted when TechCrunch reported that messages sent by Zuckerberg were being deleted in other people’s inboxes without their knowledge or consent. The feature was not available to other users at the time.

Meanwhile The Verge noted in November 2016 that Zuckerberg’s public posts about the media and Facebook’s role in the 2016 US election had disappeared.

The volume of censorship now taking place in America is unprecedented as well as ominous. Alex explains that now is the time for patriots to stand up before Big Tech fully turns America into China.

Freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) on Friday blamed an anonymous staffer for the early rollout of the Green New Deal FAQ, which was widely-mocked for saying there would be a guarantee of economic security even for those “unwilling to work” and calling for the elimination of “farting cows.”

During a town hall that aired on MSNBC Friday night, Ocasio-Cortez was asked by host Chris Hayes whether she thought that office rolled out the Green New Deal the right way.

“What I will say is that I definitely had a staffer that had a very bad day at work and did release a working draft early, so I get that that’s what they are seizing on,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “Really what we need to do is have a serious conversation and even in those draft versions what they were talking about is really about the fact that we need to innovate on technology.”

She went on to reference “cow flatulence,” prompting Hayes to interject, “It sounds ridiculous, but it literally is an issue.”

Attorney General William Barr is a “stooge” for President Trump coordinating “a high-tech coup” by announcing that Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report found no collusion, said late night host Bill Maher.

On Friday’s HBO show “Real Time,” Maher accused “dictator” Trump of hiring Barr for the sole purpose of being exonerated by him.

“You know, high-tech lynching. Remember that phrase? This is like a high-tech coup,” Maher told his guest panel. “I know Barr is an esteemed person, William Barr. He’s a stooge. This is what Third World countries do. The dictator appoints somebody who exonerates him. That’s what happened here.”

Additionally, Maher said, Barr’s announcement last week was simply to provide cover for Trump when Mueller’s full report is released a few weeks later when the true nature of the collusion is revealed.

“I think the whole point of what Barr did was to give Trump a month-long lead to get out there and do the end zone dance, put the bullshit out, I’m completely exonerated. Because then, when we come up with the other stuff, it’s a month later, and then we’re like undoing something.”

Barr released a 4-page summary last weekend outlining Mueller’s main findings, which concluded the Trump campaign did not collude with Russia and Trump did not obstruct justice during the course of the “investigation.”

Alex Jones presents video footage of Texas Representative Mike Conaway calling out California Representative Adam Schiff on the house floor for his open participation in pushing propaganda on the American public that suggested President Trump colluded with the Russian Government in 2016.

Media companies are refusing to air advertisements for an anti-abortion movie that criticizes the practices of Planned Parenthood.

The Hallmark Channel, Lifetime, and media properties owned by the Discovery conglomerate are among the organizations that rejected the movie’s advertisements. The movie’s producers says that Fox News Channel is the only mainstream media outlet to have accepted its advertisements.

The movie, “Unplanned,” premiered in 1,000 movie theaters across the nation. Pure Flix, the production company behind the film, primarily targets Christian and social conservative audiences. Its feature “God’s Not Dead” grossed over $62 million on a $2 million budget, according to box office releases in 2014.

President Donald Trump on Friday called on The Washington Post and New York Times to be stripped of Pulitzer Prizes that the newspapers received last year for reporting on Russiagate.

So funny that The New York Times & The Washington Post got a Pulitzer Prize for their coverage (100% NEGATIVE and FAKE!) of Collusion with Russia – And there was No Collusion! So, they were either duped or corrupt? In any event, their prizes should be taken away by the Committee! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2019

The Post and Times shared the 2018 Pulitzer for a series of reports on developments in the Russia investigation.

Many of the core allegations in the reports were undercut with the recent revelation that special counsel Robert Mueller did not find collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian government.

“The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities,” Mueller wrote in his 400-page report, according to Attorney General William Barr. (RELATED: Mueller: No Collusion)

According to Barr, Mueller also did not establish “that any U.S. person or Trump campaign official or associate” conspired or “knowingly coordinated” with Russian efforts to use social media platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 campaign or to hack Democrats’ emails and disseminate them online.

On Sunday, after Barr released the summary of Mueller’s findings, Donald Trump Jr. also blasted The Post and Times over their award-winning reports.

They should convert those Pulitzer’s to #fakenews awards. How do you win a reporting award for reporting fake news? There should be a recall. Those Pulitzer’s were earned like Liz Warren’s tenure. https://t.co/5Bak6VTQ5G — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) March 24, 2019

In announcing the awards in April 2018, the Pulitzer committee praised the Post and Times’ Russia reporting.

The Post and Times received the award “for deeply sourced, relentlessly reported coverage in the public interest that dramatically furthered the nation’s understanding of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and its connections to the Trump campaign, the President-elect’s transition team and his eventual administration,” the committee said.

None of the 20 stories cited by the Pulitzer committee have come under particular scrutiny. But most furthered the narrative of collusion between the Trump team and Russia.

President Trump gave a rousing speech in Michigan where he went on offense against the MSM and the Deep State. Alex Jones gives his take on the future for President Trump’s America first agenda.

Former President Barack Obama’s DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson said Thursday that the U.S. is “truly in a crisis” at the southern border.

“A little bit of context here. When I was in office in Kirstjen Nielsen’s job, at her desk, I’d get to work around 6:30 in the morning, and there would be my intelligence book sitting on my desk, the PDB, and also the apprehension numbers from the day before,” Johnson said during his appearance on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.”

“My staff would tell you if it was under 1,000 apprehension the day before, that was a relatively good number, and if it was above 1,000, it was a relatively bad number, and I was going to be in a bad mood the whole day.”

“On Tuesday there were 4,000 apprehensions. I know that a thousand overwhelms the system. I can’t imagine what 4,000 a day looks like. So, we are truly in a crisis,” he continued.

A caravan migrant from Honduras who complained about being given beans to eat during her journey through Mexico is now in a Texas jail facing one charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.

The woman became the topic of a viral video during her journey. The woman’s sister is also facing similar charges and both have an immigration detainer placed on them preventing them from bonding out.

Jail records from Dallas County jail revealed that Mirian Zelaya and Mirna Zelaya are both being held in a detention center on a charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.

While jail records do not reveal the details that led to the charge, the news outlet Mundo Hispanico revealed that the two women allegedly beat another woman who was providing them with housing.

A caravan migrant from Honduras who complained about being given beans to eat during her journey through Mexico is now in a Texas jail facing one charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.

The woman became the topic of a viral video during her journey. The woman’s sister is also facing similar charges and both have an immigration detainer placed on them preventing them from bonding out.

Jail records from Dallas County jail revealed that Mirian Zelaya and Mirna Zelaya are both being held in a detention center on a charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.

While jail records do not reveal the details that led to the charge, the news outlet Mundo Hispanico revealed that the two women allegedly beat another woman who was providing them with housing.

President Donald Trump is threatening to close parts of the U.S.-Mexican border as record numbers of migrants surge through the legal loopholes created by Congress and judges.

“CONGRESS MUST CHANGE OUR WEAK IMMIGRATION LAWS NOW … If Mexico doesn’t immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States throug [sic] our Southern Border, I will be CLOSING….. ….the Border, or large sections of the Border, next week,” he said in a series of three tweets Friday morning.

The DEMOCRATS have given us the weakest immigration laws anywhere in the World. Mexico has the strongest, & they make more than $100 Billion a year on the U.S. Therefore, CONGRESS MUST CHANGE OUR WEAK IMMIGRATION LAWS NOW, & Mexico must stop illegals from entering the U.S…. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2019

….through their country and our Southern Border. Mexico has for many years made a fortune off of the U.S., far greater than Border Costs. If Mexico doesn’t immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States throug our Southern Border, I will be CLOSING….. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2019

….the Border, or large sections of the Border, next week. This would be so easy for Mexico to do, but they just take our money and “talk.” Besides, we lose so much money with them, especially when you add in drug trafficking etc.), that the Border closing would be a good thing! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2019

Border officials are ramping up their estimates for the number of migrants who will grab the opportunity created by Congress. Predictions for 2019 have climbed from 900,000 to 1.2 million during the last few weeks.

Alex Jones breaks down how, according to the commissioner of Customs & Border Protection, America’s immigration system is at a breaking point as illegal aliens flood across the border and the government releases them into American cities as catch and release thrives. This is the UN’s plan to break our southern border.The United States will no longer provide foreign aid to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, the State Department announced Saturday.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has ordered the State Department to cut off all aid to the three nations – collectively known as the Northern Triangle – for their failure to address the waves of caravans traveling to the U.S. southern border.

“At the Secretary’s instruction, we are carrying out the President’s direction and ending FY 2017 and FY 2018 foreign assistance programs for the Northern Triangle. We will be engaging Congress as part of this process,” a State Department spokesperson said in a statement.

President Trump warned reporters Friday that he may shut down the southern border over Mexico’s failure to stop “massive caravans” coming from the Northern Triangle.

“We have right now two big caravans coming up from Guatemala, massive caravans, walking right through Mexico,” Trump said. “So Mexico is tough, they can stop them. And if they don’t stop them, we’re closing the border.”

President Trump: "Massive caravans walking right through Mexico. So Mexico's tough. They can stop them but they chose not to. Now they're going to stop them. And if they don't stop them, we're closing the border. We'll keep it closed for a long time, I'm not playing games." pic.twitter.com/xOZI1e6Oe9 — The Hill (@thehill) March 29, 2019

“We were paying them tremendous amounts of money. And we’re not paying them anymore. Because they haven’t done a thing for us. They set up these caravans,” he added.

Mexico warned the U.S. that the “mother of all caravans” comprised of nearly 20,000 people has formed and is making its way to the border.

“We have information that a new caravan is forming in Honduras, that they’re calling ‘the mother of all caravans,’ and they are thinking it could have more than 20,000 people,” Mexico’s Interior Secretary Olga Sanchez Cordero said Wednesday.

Officials reportedly did not say how much money would be withheld by the order.

“Between last year and this year, about $1.3 billion was allocated to the region with the vast majority of it going to those three countries, according to a study from the Congressional Research Service,” CNN reported.

Alex Jones presents a report produced by CNN where Latino voters living along the border in Texas make it completely clear that they want the wall, and in fact, they want it taller and longer than its current construction.

Facebook ‘accidentally’ deleted old posts by CEO Mark Zuckerberg during pivotal periods in the company’s history, reports Business Insider.

Zuck’s old posts – which were even reported on by news outlets at the time – have vanished, including every comment he made in 2007 and 2008.

“The most drastic deletions involved entire years. Throughout both 2006 and 2009, Zuckerberg was regularly active on the social network — but there are no posts visible of any kind for the two full years in between. The spokesperson confirmed that all the posts during 2007 and 2008 were deleted.” -Business Insider

The company says the posts were “mistakenly deleted” due to “technical errors.”

“A few years ago some of Mark’s posts were mistakenly deleted due to technical errors. The work required to restore them would have been extensive and not guaranteed to be successful so we didn’t do it,” reads a statement by a spokesperson.

“We agree people should be able to find information about past announcements and major company news, which is why for years we’ve shared and archived this information publicly — first on our blog and in recent years on our Newsroom.”

“These disappearances, along with other changes Facebook has made to how it saves its archive of announcements and blog posts, make it much harder to parse the social network’s historical record. This makes it far more difficult to hold the company, and Zuckerberg himself, accountable to past statements — particularly during a period of intense scrutiny of the company in the wake of a string of scandals.”

“The very nature of the issue means it is extremely challenging to make a full accounting of what exactly what has gone missing over the years. The spokesperson said they didn’t know how many posts in total were deleted.” -Business Insider

One such deleted post which was widely reported (and now no longer works) was an important document in Facebook’s history, as Zuckerberg promised during the April 2012 acquisition of Instagram that “we’re committed to building and growing Instagram independently,” – a commitment the company never stuck to, while Instagram’s two co-founders departed last year amid clashes with the 34-year-old billionaire CEO.

Harder to search the archives

According to the report, Facebook has also made it more difficult to navigate its dedicated announcement blog – after launching their new “Newsroom” for key announcements – the ability to search for old posts has all but been disabled.

“Now, when you click on a link to a blog post included in an old news story, it redirects you to the Newsroom. The Newsroom doesn’t have copies of many of these old blog posts, meaning there’s no easy way to access them.”

“They do still exist in one form — as a “note” saved to Facebook’s public “Facebook” page on the social network. But until today there was no centralized archive through which to browse them, like what was available for the Facebook blog, or like what exists today for Newsroom posts.”

“Instead, to read a specific one, you had to either know about it already and search for keywords on Google, or scroll back through the Facebook page’s thousands of posts over the years”. -Business Insider

Facebook added a “notes” tab to the Facebook page to access the old entries after BI contacted them for the story – which notes that “The net effect of this change to the archives was to drastically obfuscate Facebook’s historical record — making it far harder to find past statements and announcements from the company about itself.”

In April 2018, controversy erupted when TechCrunch reported that messages sent by Zuckerberg were being deleted in other people’s inboxes without their knowledge or consent. The feature was not available to other users at the time.

Meanwhile The Verge noted in November 2016 that Zuckerberg’s public posts about the media and Facebook’s role in the 2016 US election had disappeared.

The volume of censorship now taking place in America is unprecedented as well as ominous. Alex explains that now is the time for patriots to stand up before Big Tech fully turns America into China.

Freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) on Friday blamed an anonymous staffer for the early rollout of the Green New Deal FAQ, which was widely-mocked for saying there would be a guarantee of economic security even for those “unwilling to work” and calling for the elimination of “farting cows.”

During a town hall that aired on MSNBC Friday night, Ocasio-Cortez was asked by host Chris Hayes whether she thought that office rolled out the Green New Deal the right way.

“What I will say is that I definitely had a staffer that had a very bad day at work and did release a working draft early, so I get that that’s what they are seizing on,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “Really what we need to do is have a serious conversation and even in those draft versions what they were talking about is really about the fact that we need to innovate on technology.”

She went on to reference “cow flatulence,” prompting Hayes to interject, “It sounds ridiculous, but it literally is an issue.”

Attorney General William Barr is a “stooge” for President Trump coordinating “a high-tech coup” by announcing that Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report found no collusion, said late night host Bill Maher.

On Friday’s HBO show “Real Time,” Maher accused “dictator” Trump of hiring Barr for the sole purpose of being exonerated by him.

“You know, high-tech lynching. Remember that phrase? This is like a high-tech coup,” Maher told his guest panel. “I know Barr is an esteemed person, William Barr. He’s a stooge. This is what Third World countries do. The dictator appoints somebody who exonerates him. That’s what happened here.”

Additionally, Maher said, Barr’s announcement last week was simply to provide cover for Trump when Mueller’s full report is released a few weeks later when the true nature of the collusion is revealed.

“I think the whole point of what Barr did was to give Trump a month-long lead to get out there and do the end zone dance, put the bullshit out, I’m completely exonerated. Because then, when we come up with the other stuff, it’s a month later, and then we’re like undoing something.”

Barr released a 4-page summary last weekend outlining Mueller’s main findings, which concluded the Trump campaign did not collude with Russia and Trump did not obstruct justice during the course of the “investigation.”

Alex Jones presents video footage of Texas Representative Mike Conaway calling out California Representative Adam Schiff on the house floor for his open participation in pushing propaganda on the American public that suggested President Trump colluded with the Russian Government in 2016.

Media companies are refusing to air advertisements for an anti-abortion movie that criticizes the practices of Planned Parenthood.

The Hallmark Channel, Lifetime, and media properties owned by the Discovery conglomerate are among the organizations that rejected the movie’s advertisements. The movie’s producers says that Fox News Channel is the only mainstream media outlet to have accepted its advertisements.

The movie, “Unplanned,” premiered in 1,000 movie theaters across the nation. Pure Flix, the production company behind the film, primarily targets Christian and social conservative audiences. Its feature “God’s Not Dead” grossed over $62 million on a $2 million budget, according to box office releases in 2014.

President Donald Trump on Friday called on The Washington Post and New York Times to be stripped of Pulitzer Prizes that the newspapers received last year for reporting on Russiagate.

So funny that The New York Times & The Washington Post got a Pulitzer Prize for their coverage (100% NEGATIVE and FAKE!) of Collusion with Russia – And there was No Collusion! So, they were either duped or corrupt? In any event, their prizes should be taken away by the Committee! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2019

The Post and Times shared the 2018 Pulitzer for a series of reports on developments in the Russia investigation.

Many of the core allegations in the reports were undercut with the recent revelation that special counsel Robert Mueller did not find collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian government.

“The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities,” Mueller wrote in his 400-page report, according to Attorney General William Barr. (RELATED: Mueller: No Collusion)

According to Barr, Mueller also did not establish “that any U.S. person or Trump campaign official or associate” conspired or “knowingly coordinated” with Russian efforts to use social media platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 campaign or to hack Democrats’ emails and disseminate them online.

On Sunday, after Barr released the summary of Mueller’s findings, Donald Trump Jr. also blasted The Post and Times over their award-winning reports.

They should convert those Pulitzer’s to #fakenews awards. How do you win a reporting award for reporting fake news? There should be a recall. Those Pulitzer’s were earned like Liz Warren’s tenure. https://t.co/5Bak6VTQ5G — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) March 24, 2019

In announcing the awards in April 2018, the Pulitzer committee praised the Post and Times’ Russia reporting.

The Post and Times received the award “for deeply sourced, relentlessly reported coverage in the public interest that dramatically furthered the nation’s understanding of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and its connections to the Trump campaign, the President-elect’s transition team and his eventual administration,” the committee said.

None of the 20 stories cited by the Pulitzer committee have come under particular scrutiny. But most furthered the narrative of collusion between the Trump team and Russia.

President Trump gave a rousing speech in Michigan where he went on offense against the MSM and the Deep State. Alex Jones gives his take on the future for President Trump’s America first agenda.

Former President Barack Obama’s DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson said Thursday that the U.S. is “truly in a crisis” at the southern border.

“A little bit of context here. When I was in office in Kirstjen Nielsen’s job, at her desk, I’d get to work around 6:30 in the morning, and there would be my intelligence book sitting on my desk, the PDB, and also the apprehension numbers from the day before,” Johnson said during his appearance on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.”

“My staff would tell you if it was under 1,000 apprehension the day before, that was a relatively good number, and if it was above 1,000, it was a relatively bad number, and I was going to be in a bad mood the whole day.”

“On Tuesday there were 4,000 apprehensions. I know that a thousand overwhelms the system. I can’t imagine what 4,000 a day looks like. So, we are truly in a crisis,” he continued.

President Donald Trump is threatening to close parts of the U.S.-Mexican border as record numbers of migrants surge through the legal loopholes created by Congress and judges.

“CONGRESS MUST CHANGE OUR WEAK IMMIGRATION LAWS NOW … If Mexico doesn’t immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States throug [sic] our Southern Border, I will be CLOSING….. ….the Border, or large sections of the Border, next week,” he said in a series of three tweets Friday morning.

The DEMOCRATS have given us the weakest immigration laws anywhere in the World. Mexico has the strongest, & they make more than $100 Billion a year on the U.S. Therefore, CONGRESS MUST CHANGE OUR WEAK IMMIGRATION LAWS NOW, & Mexico must stop illegals from entering the U.S…. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2019

….through their country and our Southern Border. Mexico has for many years made a fortune off of the U.S., far greater than Border Costs. If Mexico doesn’t immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States throug our Southern Border, I will be CLOSING….. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2019

….the Border, or large sections of the Border, next week. This would be so easy for Mexico to do, but they just take our money and “talk.” Besides, we lose so much money with them, especially when you add in drug trafficking etc.), that the Border closing would be a good thing! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2019

Border officials are ramping up their estimates for the number of migrants who will grab the opportunity created by Congress. Predictions for 2019 have climbed from 900,000 to 1.2 million during the last few weeks.

Citing a ‘high-level source,’ Rand Paul says former CIA Director John Brennan grew frustrated that no one was giving credence to the Clinton-funded dossier, so he attached it to an intelligence report, ensuring that it would be seen by President Obama and President-elect Trump.

BREAKING: A high-level source tells me it was Brennan who insisted that the unverified and fake Steele dossier be included in the Intelligence Report… Brennan should be asked to testify under oath in Congress ASAP. — Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) March 27, 2019

Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) told Breitbart News exclusively on Wednesday that President Donald Trump told senators at the weekly GOP luncheon that he backs his call for an investigation into the origins of the Russia scandal “hoax” that Trump has now been cleared of by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.

“The president was at lunch today and he voiced his support for investigating the people who concocted this hoax,” Paul told Breitbart News. “He didn’t use the word hoax, those are my words, but I think we should get to the bottom of this and he believes we should get to the bottom of this because this should never happen to another president. He feels that it’s damaging to the country, damaging to the ability to lead the country, that we basically—somebody within the Obama administration, within the DOJ and the FBI, basically concocted an investigation, trumped it up to be something that it wasn’t and then we’ve gone through two years of the country being stalled because of this fake investigation.”

Rand exclaimed (at around 3: 02): “Officials must be asked under oath what Obama knew, and when…”



When asked specifically if former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, former CIA Director John Brennan, and former National Security Adviser Susan Rice should be called to testify about their role in the matter – and be subpoenaed to force their testimony if they refuse to voluntarily comply.



Colorado’s Senate passed the so-called ‘red flag bill’ that allows law enforcement to seize people’s guns if a court rules them at risk to themselves or others. Millie Weaver joins Alex to discuss the Big Tech smear machine.

Paul said:

“Absolutely. We have John Brennan, who lied to us, who spied on the Senate and tapped into Senate computers,” Paul said. “We have James Clapper who came before the Intelligence Committee and said they weren’t collecting all of our phone data. So both Brennan and Clapper have been known to lie in official testimony. They should be brought forward and asked what was their part? What was their role in ginning up this dossier? Amazingly, most media outlets wouldn’t even print the dossier because they thought it was so unsubstantiated. And then all of a sudden, the FBI gives it credence. There’s one interesting story out today that says still no one would print it, so then Comey gives it to President Trump and that’s when it’s been leaked and then we have a news story saying that this dossier had been given to the president and that became the hook or the story.” “I think it’s a terrible tragedy,” Paul said of the investigation. “It cost us $30 million, two years to go through all of this, the media has been so consumed by all of this that they have barely had time to report on any of the real news of the day. I think we shouldn’t allow this to happen again to a Republican or a Democrat.”

For now, the full Mueller report is not yet public—and Paul said he intends to object to its full release until such time as all the documents regarding the Obama administration’s abuse of power to start this “hoax” investigation are also released.

“My plan is to object to the release of the Mueller report and/or all of the Mueller information until they also release the complete information from the White House, DOJ, FBI, on why they chose to credit the dossier,” Paul said. “What were the discussions? And who was it who was promoting that the dossier was real? How did it come about? How were all these judgments made? So, the other side wants to read a million pages of Mueller report. We’re going to want to read a million pages of how this whole Russian hoax got started.”

This is the first part of a lengthy interview with Sen. Paul on Spygate in the wake of the Mueller probe clearing President Trump on all matters. More is forthcoming soon…

Update: In response to Barr’s letter announcing the upcoming release of a redacted version of the Mueller report, Chairman Nadler said: “As I informed the Attorney General..Congress requires the full and complete Mueller report, without redactions, as well as access to the underlying evidence, by April 2. That deadline still stands.”

Attorney General William Barr wrote a Friday letter in response to Senate Judiciary Chair Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) notifying them that a redacted copy of the Mueller report will be delivered to Congress, then available to the public, by mid-April “if not sooner.”

“Everyone will soon be able to read it on their own,” wrote Barr.



Alex Jones breaks the news that Joseph Farah, founder and editor-in-chief of World Net Daily, has suffered a serious stroke. Patriots around the world, please send him your prayers.

Barr says that his office is working with Special Counsel Robert Mueller to redact sensitive information which could affect ongoing matters, infringe on someone’s personal privacy or information which could compromise the DOJ’s sources and methods of investigation.

The report will be nearly 400 pages, while Barr writes that there is no plans to let the White House review it beforehand.

“Although the president would have the right to assert privilege over certain parts of the report, he has stated publicly that he intends to defer to me and, accordingly, there are no plans to submit the report to the White House for a privilege review.”

Barr also disputes the characterization that a four-page letter released on Sunday was a “summary” of Mueller’s report.

“My March 24 letter was not, and did not purport to be, an exhaustive recounting of the Special Counsel’s investigation or report,” writes Barr. “As my letter made clear, my notification to Congress and the public provided, pending release of the report, a summary of its “principal conclusions” — that is, its bottom line. The Special Counsel’s report is nearly 400 pages long (exclusive of tables and appendices) and sets forth the Special Counsel’s findings, his analysis, and the reasons for his conclusions. . . . I do not believe it would be in the public’s interest for me to attempt to summarize the full report or to release it in serial or piecemeal fashion.”

Barr then says he will be available to testify in front of Congress on May 1 and 2.

Former Nevada State Assemblywoman Lucy Flores detailed, in a piece for The Cut, a very awkward and uncomfortable encounter she had with former Vice President Joe Biden in 2014.

Flores was the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor in Nevada in 2014, and she recounts how Biden came to the state ahead of the election to campaign.

At the event in question, Flores says she felt Biden’s hands on her shoulders:

I felt him get closer to me from behind. He leaned further in and inhaled my hair. I was mortified. I thought to myself, “I didn’t wash my hair today and the vice-president of the United States is smelling it. And also, what in the actual fuck? Why is the vice-president of the United States smelling my hair?” He proceeded to plant a big slow kiss on the back of my head. My brain couldn’t process what was happening. I was embarrassed. I was shocked. I was confused. There is a Spanish saying, “tragame tierra,” it means, “earth, swallow me whole.” I couldn’t move and I couldn’t say anything. I wanted nothing more than to get Biden away from me. My name was called and I was never happier to get on stage in front of an audience.

She writes that Biden’s behavior was “blatantly inappropriate and unnerving” and he made her feel “uneasy, gross, and confused.”

The BBC was ordered to pay damages after the far-left outlet published fake news claiming Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko “authorized” an illegal payment of $400,000 to Michael Cohen for additional face time during a June 2017 meeting with President Trump.

“We apologize to Mr. Poroshenko for any distress caused and have agreed to pay him damages, legal costs and have participated in a joint statement in open court,” the BBC’s said in a written apology published Thursday.

In the May 2018 piece, the disgraced BBC made the absurd claim that Poroshenko, who already had a meeting set up with Trump, paid this $400,000 to extend the meeting.

Think about how well this utterly deranged piece of fake news fits into the overall media’s Russia Collusion Hoax.

Poroshenko is an aggressive opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin, so naturally the only way he could get serious face time with Trump (aka Putin’s Stooge) is through a six-figure bribe. Michael Cohen was still the president’s personal lawyer at this time, which means the media were desperate for us to see Cohen as Trump’s world-traveling bagman, because that would lend credibility to the phony dossier’s lie about Cohen visiting Prague to pay off the hackers who got Hillary’s emails. The story openly insinuates Trump is both in Putin’s pocket and accepting bribes.

A left-leaning news editor claims he was bullied to hold off on publishing a story, regarding the upcoming Democrat debates, by MSNBC’s politics editor working “on behalf of the DNC.”

In a lengthy thread published on Twitter Friday, New York Magazine and Huffington Post contributor Yashar Ali called out Dafna Linzer, NBC News & MSNBC politics managing editor, over a threatening phone call in which she insisted he not publish a story in order to give the DNC more time to prepare.

Ali says Linzer called after he had phoned the DNC to fact check the story before publishing it in his personal newsletter. During the call the DNC also requested he delay the story for about an hour, to which he refused because the news could leak during that time leaving him without a scoop.

“After exchanging pleasantries, Dafna told me that she received a call from the DNC and was told I had a story,” Ali documented in several tweets. “Now it’s not strange that the DNC called her, they were coordinating an announcement. What was strange was that she was calling me and taking a menacing tone.”

“She asked if I could hold the story and I said I couldn’t. She was agitated, ‘why not?’ I said I’m not going to lose a scoop. Then she got angrier and said ‘Why not? It’s not a big deal, let them make a few phone calls.'”

Ali says he still can’t figure out why Linzer would stick her neck on the line for what he considered a “stupid scoop,” but that he felt compelled to expose Linzer’s “bad behavior” publicly after speaking with colleagues and feeling she “advocated for me to not do something on behalf of a political party.”

2. Dafna, who oversees the political coverage for NBC and MSNBC, was calling to bully me into delaying the publication of an innocuous scoop and at no point did she advocate for her network, it was only about the DNC. Here’s how this all started… — Yashar Ali 🐘 (@yashar) March 29, 2019

4. At first I thought it was just a fun tidbit that I could tweet out. But after I called several presidential campaign staffers I learn that all the Dem campaigns were desperate to learn what the dates were going to be. I decided to post the scoop as an item in my newsletter. — Yashar Ali 🐘 (@yashar) March 29, 2019

6. So I won’t share most of what was said but can tell you it’s pretty run-of-the mill stuff. I asked the DNC if my tip was accurate and they asked if they could call me back in 10 minutes. A few minutes later they called back and asked if I could delay posting my scoop — Yashar Ali 🐘 (@yashar) March 29, 2019

8. I’ve never spoken to Dafna by phone. A couple years ago she reached out to me to see if I wanted to have coffee and talk about working at NBC News but I declined as I was actively investigating NBC matters and thought it would be strange if I discussed a job. — Yashar Ali 🐘 (@yashar) March 29, 2019

10. After exchanging pleasantries, Dafna told me that she received a call from the DNC and was told I had a story. Now it’s not strange that the DNC called her, they were coordinating an announcement. What was strange was that she was calling me and taking a menacing tone — Yashar Ali 🐘 (@yashar) March 29, 2019

12. I realized that @DafnaLinzer, the head of all political coverage for NBC News and MSNBC wasn’t calling to advocate for her network, she was calling to advocate the DNC’s position. She wanted me to wait so they could call state party leaders. — Yashar Ali 🐘 (@yashar) March 29, 2019

14. I would lose a scoop. Dafna reminded me she was a nat sec reporter at WAPO for ten years and they would hold stuff all the time (note: so people wouldn’t get killed). “Why can’t you just wait, let them make their calls, then you’ll be the first to put it into print,” she said — Yashar Ali 🐘 (@yashar) March 29, 2019

16. I kept telling Dafna no, that I wasn’t waiting. And she kept getting more frustrated. She was exasperated…she didn’t understand why I couldn’t wait for the DNC to make their state notification calls. — Yashar Ali 🐘 (@yashar) March 29, 2019

18. 2/3 of the way into the conversation Dafna started a sentence with “this is off the record.” She hadn’t said it at the beginning of our conversation and most important at no point did I agree when she said “off record” to keep it off record. — Yashar Ali 🐘 (@yashar) March 29, 2019

20. She said “off record” one more time later in the call and again I just let her keep talking, I did not agree to anything. I then told her I had to go talk to my editor and she got even more frustrated and said “No. I want to talk to you about this.” — Yashar Ali 🐘 (@yashar) March 29, 2019

22. After the call with Dafna I published the stupid scoop. Then I did a gut check and over the next two hours I called 10 experienced prominent reporters and told them the story. They were all stunned by what Dafna did and encouraged me to share it publicly. — Yashar Ali 🐘 (@yashar) March 29, 2019

24. There are plenty of times reporters will introduce people in politics to other reporters or TV people. I have done it many times, that is advocating for more coverage, not less. Dafna was advocating for me to not do something on behalf of a political party. — Yashar Ali 🐘 (@yashar) March 29, 2019

25. What I can’t figure out is (and no one else I spoke to could understand), why open yourself up to this for a stupid story? How was this worth it? END — Yashar Ali 🐘 (@yashar) March 29, 2019

Zero Hedge notes Ali’s story suggests “how closely the MSM and DNC will be ‘coordinating’ efforts going into 2020.”


The United States will no longer provide foreign aid to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, the State Department announced Saturday.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has ordered the State Department to cut off all aid to the three nations – collectively known as the Northern Triangle – for their failure to address the waves of caravans traveling to the U.S. southern border.

“At the Secretary’s instruction, we are carrying out the President’s direction and ending FY 2017 and FY 2018 foreign assistance programs for the Northern Triangle. We will be engaging Congress as part of this process,” a State Department spokesperson said in a statement.

President Trump warned reporters Friday that he may shut down the southern border over Mexico’s failure to stop “massive caravans” coming from the Northern Triangle.

“We have right now two big caravans coming up from Guatemala, massive caravans, walking right through Mexico,” Trump said. “So Mexico is tough, they can stop them. And if they don’t stop them, we’re closing the border.”

President Trump: "Massive caravans walking right through Mexico. So Mexico's tough. They can stop them but they chose not to. Now they're going to stop them. And if they don't stop them, we're closing the border. We'll keep it closed for a long time, I'm not playing games." pic.twitter.com/xOZI1e6Oe9 — The Hill (@thehill) March 29, 2019

“We were paying them tremendous amounts of money. And we’re not paying them anymore. Because they haven’t done a thing for us. They set up these caravans,” he added.

Mexico warned the U.S. that the “mother of all caravans” comprised of nearly 20,000 people has formed and is making its way to the border.

“We have information that a new caravan is forming in Honduras, that they’re calling ‘the mother of all caravans,’ and they are thinking it could have more than 20,000 people,” Mexico’s Interior Secretary Olga Sanchez Cordero said Wednesday.

Officials reportedly did not say how much money would be withheld by the order.

“Between last year and this year, about $1.3 billion was allocated to the region with the vast majority of it going to those three countries, according to a study from the Congressional Research Service,” CNN reported.

The United States will no longer provide foreign aid to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, the State Department announced Saturday.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has ordered the State Department to cut off all aid to the three nations – collectively known as the Northern Triangle – for their failure to address the waves of caravans traveling to the U.S. southern border.

“At the Secretary’s instruction, we are carrying out the President’s direction and ending FY 2017 and FY 2018 foreign assistance programs for the Northern Triangle. We will be engaging Congress as part of this process,” a State Department spokesperson said in a statement.

President Trump warned reporters Friday that he may shut down the southern border over Mexico’s failure to stop “massive caravans” coming from the Northern Triangle.

“We have right now two big caravans coming up from Guatemala, massive caravans, walking right through Mexico,” Trump said. “So Mexico is tough, they can stop them. And if they don’t stop them, we’re closing the border.”

President Trump: "Massive caravans walking right through Mexico. So Mexico's tough. They can stop them but they chose not to. Now they're going to stop them. And if they don't stop them, we're closing the border. We'll keep it closed for a long time, I'm not playing games." pic.twitter.com/xOZI1e6Oe9 — The Hill (@thehill) March 29, 2019

“We were paying them tremendous amounts of money. And we’re not paying them anymore. Because they haven’t done a thing for us. They set up these caravans,” he added.

Mexico warned the U.S. that the “mother of all caravans” comprised of nearly 20,000 people has formed and is making its way to the border.

“We have information that a new caravan is forming in Honduras, that they’re calling ‘the mother of all caravans,’ and they are thinking it could have more than 20,000 people,” Mexico’s Interior Secretary Olga Sanchez Cordero said Wednesday.

Officials reportedly did not say how much money would be withheld by the order.

“Between last year and this year, about $1.3 billion was allocated to the region with the vast majority of it going to those three countries, according to a study from the Congressional Research Service,” CNN reported.

Facebook ‘accidentally’ deleted old posts by CEO Mark Zuckerberg during pivotal periods in the company’s history, reports Business Insider.

Zuck’s old posts – which were even reported on by news outlets at the time – have vanished, including every comment he made in 2007 and 2008.

“The most drastic deletions involved entire years. Throughout both 2006 and 2009, Zuckerberg was regularly active on the social network — but there are no posts visible of any kind for the two full years in between. The spokesperson confirmed that all the posts during 2007 and 2008 were deleted.” -Business Insider

The company says the posts were “mistakenly deleted” due to “technical errors.”

“A few years ago some of Mark’s posts were mistakenly deleted due to technical errors. The work required to restore them would have been extensive and not guaranteed to be successful so we didn’t do it,” reads a statement by a spokesperson.

“We agree people should be able to find information about past announcements and major company news, which is why for years we’ve shared and archived this information publicly — first on our blog and in recent years on our Newsroom.”

“These disappearances, along with other changes Facebook has made to how it saves its archive of announcements and blog posts, make it much harder to parse the social network’s historical record. This makes it far more difficult to hold the company, and Zuckerberg himself, accountable to past statements — particularly during a period of intense scrutiny of the company in the wake of a string of scandals.”

“The very nature of the issue means it is extremely challenging to make a full accounting of what exactly what has gone missing over the years. The spokesperson said they didn’t know how many posts in total were deleted.” -Business Insider

One such deleted post which was widely reported (and now no longer works) was an important document in Facebook’s history, as Zuckerberg promised during the April 2012 acquisition of Instagram that “we’re committed to building and growing Instagram independently,” – a commitment the company never stuck to, while Instagram’s two co-founders departed last year amid clashes with the 34-year-old billionaire CEO.

Harder to search the archives

According to the report, Facebook has also made it more difficult to navigate its dedicated announcement blog – after launching their new “Newsroom” for key announcements – the ability to search for old posts has all but been disabled.

“Now, when you click on a link to a blog post included in an old news story, it redirects you to the Newsroom. The Newsroom doesn’t have copies of many of these old blog posts, meaning there’s no easy way to access them.”

“They do still exist in one form — as a “note” saved to Facebook’s public “Facebook” page on the social network. But until today there was no centralized archive through which to browse them, like what was available for the Facebook blog, or like what exists today for Newsroom posts.”

“Instead, to read a specific one, you had to either know about it already and search for keywords on Google, or scroll back through the Facebook page’s thousands of posts over the years”. -Business Insider

Facebook added a “notes” tab to the Facebook page to access the old entries after BI contacted them for the story – which notes that “The net effect of this change to the archives was to drastically obfuscate Facebook’s historical record — making it far harder to find past statements and announcements from the company about itself.”

In April 2018, controversy erupted when TechCrunch reported that messages sent by Zuckerberg were being deleted in other people’s inboxes without their knowledge or consent. The feature was not available to other users at the time.

Meanwhile The Verge noted in November 2016 that Zuckerberg’s public posts about the media and Facebook’s role in the 2016 US election had disappeared.

The volume of censorship now taking place in America is unprecedented as well as ominous. Alex explains that now is the time for patriots to stand up before Big Tech fully turns America into China.

Freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) on Friday blamed an anonymous staffer for the early rollout of the Green New Deal FAQ, which was widely-mocked for saying there would be a guarantee of economic security even for those “unwilling to work” and calling for the elimination of “farting cows.”

During a town hall that aired on MSNBC Friday night, Ocasio-Cortez was asked by host Chris Hayes whether she thought that office rolled out the Green New Deal the right way.

“What I will say is that I definitely had a staffer that had a very bad day at work and did release a working draft early, so I get that that’s what they are seizing on,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “Really what we need to do is have a serious conversation and even in those draft versions what they were talking about is really about the fact that we need to innovate on technology.”

She went on to reference “cow flatulence,” prompting Hayes to interject, “It sounds ridiculous, but it literally is an issue.”

Attorney General William Barr is a “stooge” for President Trump coordinating “a high-tech coup” by announcing that Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report found no collusion, said late night host Bill Maher.

On Friday’s HBO show “Real Time,” Maher accused “dictator” Trump of hiring Barr for the sole purpose of being exonerated by him.

“You know, high-tech lynching. Remember that phrase? This is like a high-tech coup,” Maher told his guest panel. “I know Barr is an esteemed person, William Barr. He’s a stooge. This is what Third World countries do. The dictator appoints somebody who exonerates him. That’s what happened here.”

Additionally, Maher said, Barr’s announcement last week was simply to provide cover for Trump when Mueller’s full report is released a few weeks later when the true nature of the collusion is revealed.

“I think the whole point of what Barr did was to give Trump a month-long lead to get out there and do the end zone dance, put the bullshit out, I’m completely exonerated. Because then, when we come up with the other stuff, it’s a month later, and then we’re like undoing something.”

Barr released a 4-page summary last weekend outlining Mueller’s main findings, which concluded the Trump campaign did not collude with Russia and Trump did not obstruct justice during the course of the “investigation.”

Alex Jones presents video footage of Texas Representative Mike Conaway calling out California Representative Adam Schiff on the house floor for his open participation in pushing propaganda on the American public that suggested President Trump colluded with the Russian Government in 2016.

Media companies are refusing to air advertisements for an anti-abortion movie that criticizes the practices of Planned Parenthood.

The Hallmark Channel, Lifetime, and media properties owned by the Discovery conglomerate are among the organizations that rejected the movie’s advertisements. The movie’s producers says that Fox News Channel is the only mainstream media outlet to have accepted its advertisements.

The movie, “Unplanned,” premiered in 1,000 movie theaters across the nation. Pure Flix, the production company behind the film, primarily targets Christian and social conservative audiences. Its feature “God’s Not Dead” grossed over $62 million on a $2 million budget, according to box office releases in 2014.

President Donald Trump on Friday called on The Washington Post and New York Times to be stripped of Pulitzer Prizes that the newspapers received last year for reporting on Russiagate.

So funny that The New York Times & The Washington Post got a Pulitzer Prize for their coverage (100% NEGATIVE and FAKE!) of Collusion with Russia – And there was No Collusion! So, they were either duped or corrupt? In any event, their prizes should be taken away by the Committee! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2019

The Post and Times shared the 2018 Pulitzer for a series of reports on developments in the Russia investigation.

Many of the core allegations in the reports were undercut with the recent revelation that special counsel Robert Mueller did not find collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian government.

“The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities,” Mueller wrote in his 400-page report, according to Attorney General William Barr. (RELATED: Mueller: No Collusion)

According to Barr, Mueller also did not establish “that any U.S. person or Trump campaign official or associate” conspired or “knowingly coordinated” with Russian efforts to use social media platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 campaign or to hack Democrats’ emails and disseminate them online.

On Sunday, after Barr released the summary of Mueller’s findings, Donald Trump Jr. also blasted The Post and Times over their award-winning reports.

They should convert those Pulitzer’s to #fakenews awards. How do you win a reporting award for reporting fake news? There should be a recall. Those Pulitzer’s were earned like Liz Warren’s tenure. https://t.co/5Bak6VTQ5G — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) March 24, 2019

In announcing the awards in April 2018, the Pulitzer committee praised the Post and Times’ Russia reporting.

The Post and Times received the award “for deeply sourced, relentlessly reported coverage in the public interest that dramatically furthered the nation’s understanding of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and its connections to the Trump campaign, the President-elect’s transition team and his eventual administration,” the committee said.

None of the 20 stories cited by the Pulitzer committee have come under particular scrutiny. But most furthered the narrative of collusion between the Trump team and Russia.

President Trump gave a rousing speech in Michigan where he went on offense against the MSM and the Deep State. Alex Jones gives his take on the future for President Trump’s America first agenda.

Former President Barack Obama’s DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson said Thursday that the U.S. is “truly in a crisis” at the southern border.

“A little bit of context here. When I was in office in Kirstjen Nielsen’s job, at her desk, I’d get to work around 6:30 in the morning, and there would be my intelligence book sitting on my desk, the PDB, and also the apprehension numbers from the day before,” Johnson said during his appearance on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.”

“My staff would tell you if it was under 1,000 apprehension the day before, that was a relatively good number, and if it was above 1,000, it was a relatively bad number, and I was going to be in a bad mood the whole day.”

“On Tuesday there were 4,000 apprehensions. I know that a thousand overwhelms the system. I can’t imagine what 4,000 a day looks like. So, we are truly in a crisis,” he continued.

President Donald Trump is threatening to close parts of the U.S.-Mexican border as record numbers of migrants surge through the legal loopholes created by Congress and judges.

“CONGRESS MUST CHANGE OUR WEAK IMMIGRATION LAWS NOW … If Mexico doesn’t immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States throug [sic] our Southern Border, I will be CLOSING….. ….the Border, or large sections of the Border, next week,” he said in a series of three tweets Friday morning.

The DEMOCRATS have given us the weakest immigration laws anywhere in the World. Mexico has the strongest, & they make more than $100 Billion a year on the U.S. Therefore, CONGRESS MUST CHANGE OUR WEAK IMMIGRATION LAWS NOW, & Mexico must stop illegals from entering the U.S…. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2019

….the Border, or large sections of the Border, next week. This would be so easy for Mexico to do, but they just take our money and “talk.” Besides, we lose so much money with them, especially when you add in drug trafficking etc.), that the Border closing would be a good thing! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2019

Border officials are ramping up their estimates for the number of migrants who will grab the opportunity created by Congress. Predictions for 2019 have climbed from 900,000 to 1.2 million during the last few weeks.

Citing a ‘high-level source,’ Rand Paul says former CIA Director John Brennan grew frustrated that no one was giving credence to the Clinton-funded dossier, so he attached it to an intelligence report, ensuring that it would be seen by President Obama and President-elect Trump.

BREAKING: A high-level source tells me it was Brennan who insisted that the unverified and fake Steele dossier be included in the Intelligence Report… Brennan should be asked to testify under oath in Congress ASAP. — Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) March 27, 2019

Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) told Breitbart News exclusively on Wednesday that President Donald Trump told senators at the weekly GOP luncheon that he backs his call for an investigation into the origins of the Russia scandal “hoax” that Trump has now been cleared of by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.

“The president was at lunch today and he voiced his support for investigating the people who concocted this hoax,” Paul told Breitbart News. “He didn’t use the word hoax, those are my words, but I think we should get to the bottom of this and he believes we should get to the bottom of this because this should never happen to another president. He feels that it’s damaging to the country, damaging to the ability to lead the country, that we basically—somebody within the Obama administration, within the DOJ and the FBI, basically concocted an investigation, trumped it up to be something that it wasn’t and then we’ve gone through two years of the country being stalled because of this fake investigation.”

Rand exclaimed (at around 3: 02): “Officials must be asked under oath what Obama knew, and when…”



When asked specifically if former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, former CIA Director John Brennan, and former National Security Adviser Susan Rice should be called to testify about their role in the matter – and be subpoenaed to force their testimony if they refuse to voluntarily comply.

Paul said:

“Absolutely. We have John Brennan, who lied to us, who spied on the Senate and tapped into Senate computers,” Paul said. “We have James Clapper who came before the Intelligence Committee and said they weren’t collecting all of our phone data. So both Brennan and Clapper have been known to lie in official testimony. They should be brought forward and asked what was their part? What was their role in ginning up this dossier? Amazingly, most media outlets wouldn’t even print the dossier because they thought it was so unsubstantiated. And then all of a sudden, the FBI gives it credence. There’s one interesting story out today that says still no one would print it, so then Comey gives it to President Trump and that’s when it’s been leaked and then we have a news story saying that this dossier had been given to the president and that became the hook or the story.” “I think it’s a terrible tragedy,” Paul said of the investigation. “It cost us $30 million, two years to go through all of this, the media has been so consumed by all of this that they have barely had time to report on any of the real news of the day. I think we shouldn’t allow this to happen again to a Republican or a Democrat.”

For now, the full Mueller report is not yet public—and Paul said he intends to object to its full release until such time as all the documents regarding the Obama administration’s abuse of power to start this “hoax” investigation are also released.

“My plan is to object to the release of the Mueller report and/or all of the Mueller information until they also release the complete information from the White House, DOJ, FBI, on why they chose to credit the dossier,” Paul said. “What were the discussions? And who was it who was promoting that the dossier was real? How did it come about? How were all these judgments made? So, the other side wants to read a million pages of Mueller report. We’re going to want to read a million pages of how this whole Russian hoax got started.”

This is the first part of a lengthy interview with Sen. Paul on Spygate in the wake of the Mueller probe clearing President Trump on all matters. More is forthcoming soon…


Citing a ‘high-level source,’ Rand Paul says former CIA Director John Brennan grew frustrated that no one was giving credence to the Clinton-funded dossier, so he attached it to an intelligence report, ensuring that it would be seen by President Obama and President-elect Trump.

Update: In response to Barr’s letter announcing the upcoming release of a redacted version of the Mueller report, Chairman Nadler said: “As I informed the Attorney General..Congress requires the full and complete Mueller report, without redactions, as well as access to the underlying evidence, by April 2. That deadline still stands.”

Attorney General William Barr wrote a Friday letter in response to Senate Judiciary Chair Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) notifying them that a redacted copy of the Mueller report will be delivered to Congress, then available to the public, by mid-April “if not sooner.”

“Everyone will soon be able to read it on their own,” wrote Barr.



Alex Jones breaks the news that Joseph Farah, founder and editor-in-chief of World Net Daily, has suffered a serious stroke. Patriots around the world, please send him your prayers.

Barr says that his office is working with Special Counsel Robert Mueller to redact sensitive information which could affect ongoing matters, infringe on someone’s personal privacy or information which could compromise the DOJ’s sources and methods of investigation.

The report will be nearly 400 pages, while Barr writes that there is no plans to let the White House review it beforehand.

“Although the president would have the right to assert privilege over certain parts of the report, he has stated publicly that he intends to defer to me and, accordingly, there are no plans to submit the report to the White House for a privilege review.”

Barr also disputes the characterization that a four-page letter released on Sunday was a “summary” of Mueller’s report.

“My March 24 letter was not, and did not purport to be, an exhaustive recounting of the Special Counsel’s investigation or report,” writes Barr. “As my letter made clear, my notification to Congress and the public provided, pending release of the report, a summary of its “principal conclusions” — that is, its bottom line. The Special Counsel’s report is nearly 400 pages long (exclusive of tables and appendices) and sets forth the Special Counsel’s findings, his analysis, and the reasons for his conclusions. . . . I do not believe it would be in the public’s interest for me to attempt to summarize the full report or to release it in serial or piecemeal fashion.”

Barr then says he will be available to testify in front of Congress on May 1 and 2.

Former Nevada State Assemblywoman Lucy Flores detailed, in a piece for The Cut, a very awkward and uncomfortable encounter she had with former Vice President Joe Biden in 2014.

Flores was the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor in Nevada in 2014, and she recounts how Biden came to the state ahead of the election to campaign.

At the event in question, Flores says she felt Biden’s hands on her shoulders:

I felt him get closer to me from behind. He leaned further in and inhaled my hair. I was mortified. I thought to myself, “I didn’t wash my hair today and the vice-president of the United States is smelling it. And also, what in the actual fuck? Why is the vice-president of the United States smelling my hair?” He proceeded to plant a big slow kiss on the back of my head. My brain couldn’t process what was happening. I was embarrassed. I was shocked. I was confused. There is a Spanish saying, “tragame tierra,” it means, “earth, swallow me whole.” I couldn’t move and I couldn’t say anything. I wanted nothing more than to get Biden away from me. My name was called and I was never happier to get on stage in front of an audience.

She writes that Biden’s behavior was “blatantly inappropriate and unnerving” and he made her feel “uneasy, gross, and confused.”

The BBC was ordered to pay damages after the far-left outlet published fake news claiming Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko “authorized” an illegal payment of $400,000 to Michael Cohen for additional face time during a June 2017 meeting with President Trump.

“We apologize to Mr. Poroshenko for any distress caused and have agreed to pay him damages, legal costs and have participated in a joint statement in open court,” the BBC’s said in a written apology published Thursday.

In the May 2018 piece, the disgraced BBC made the absurd claim that Poroshenko, who already had a meeting set up with Trump, paid this $400,000 to extend the meeting.

Think about how well this utterly deranged piece of fake news fits into the overall media’s Russia Collusion Hoax.

Poroshenko is an aggressive opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin, so naturally the only way he could get serious face time with Trump (aka Putin’s Stooge) is through a six-figure bribe. Michael Cohen was still the president’s personal lawyer at this time, which means the media were desperate for us to see Cohen as Trump’s world-traveling bagman, because that would lend credibility to the phony dossier’s lie about Cohen visiting Prague to pay off the hackers who got Hillary’s emails. The story openly insinuates Trump is both in Putin’s pocket and accepting bribes.

A left-leaning news editor claims he was bullied to hold off on publishing a story, regarding the upcoming Democrat debates, by MSNBC’s politics editor working “on behalf of the DNC.”

In a lengthy thread published on Twitter Friday, New York Magazine and Huffington Post contributor Yashar Ali called out Dafna Linzer, NBC News & MSNBC politics managing editor, over a threatening phone call in which she insisted he not publish a story in order to give the DNC more time to prepare.

Ali says Linzer called after he had phoned the DNC to fact check the story before publishing it in his personal newsletter. During the call the DNC also requested he delay the story for about an hour, to which he refused because the news could leak during that time leaving him without a scoop.

“After exchanging pleasantries, Dafna told me that she received a call from the DNC and was told I had a story,” Ali documented in several tweets. “Now it’s not strange that the DNC called her, they were coordinating an announcement. What was strange was that she was calling me and taking a menacing tone.”

“She asked if I could hold the story and I said I couldn’t. She was agitated, ‘why not?’ I said I’m not going to lose a scoop. Then she got angrier and said ‘Why not? It’s not a big deal, let them make a few phone calls.'”

Ali says he still can’t figure out why Linzer would stick her neck on the line for what he considered a “stupid scoop,” but that he felt compelled to expose Linzer’s “bad behavior” publicly after speaking with colleagues and feeling she “advocated for me to not do something on behalf of a political party.”

2. Dafna, who oversees the political coverage for NBC and MSNBC, was calling to bully me into delaying the publication of an innocuous scoop and at no point did she advocate for her network, it was only about the DNC. Here’s how this all started… — Yashar Ali 🐘 (@yashar) March 29, 2019

4. At first I thought it was just a fun tidbit that I could tweet out. But after I called several presidential campaign staffers I learn that all the Dem campaigns were desperate to learn what the dates were going to be. I decided to post the scoop as an item in my newsletter. — Yashar Ali 🐘 (@yashar) March 29, 2019

6. So I won’t share most of what was said but can tell you it’s pretty run-of-the mill stuff. I asked the DNC if my tip was accurate and they asked if they could call me back in 10 minutes. A few minutes later they called back and asked if I could delay posting my scoop — Yashar Ali 🐘 (@yashar) March 29, 2019

8. I’ve never spoken to Dafna by phone. A couple years ago she reached out to me to see if I wanted to have coffee and talk about working at NBC News but I declined as I was actively investigating NBC matters and thought it would be strange if I discussed a job. — Yashar Ali 🐘 (@yashar) March 29, 2019

10. After exchanging pleasantries, Dafna told me that she received a call from the DNC and was told I had a story. Now it’s not strange that the DNC called her, they were coordinating an announcement. What was strange was that she was calling me and taking a menacing tone — Yashar Ali 🐘 (@yashar) March 29, 2019

12. I realized that @DafnaLinzer, the head of all political coverage for NBC News and MSNBC wasn’t calling to advocate for her network, she was calling to advocate the DNC’s position. She wanted me to wait so they could call state party leaders. — Yashar Ali 🐘 (@yashar) March 29, 2019

14. I would lose a scoop. Dafna reminded me she was a nat sec reporter at WAPO for ten years and they would hold stuff all the time (note: so people wouldn’t get killed). “Why can’t you just wait, let them make their calls, then you’ll be the first to put it into print,” she said — Yashar Ali 🐘 (@yashar) March 29, 2019

16. I kept telling Dafna no, that I wasn’t waiting. And she kept getting more frustrated. She was exasperated…she didn’t understand why I couldn’t wait for the DNC to make their state notification calls. — Yashar Ali 🐘 (@yashar) March 29, 2019

18. 2/3 of the way into the conversation Dafna started a sentence with “this is off the record.” She hadn’t said it at the beginning of our conversation and most important at no point did I agree when she said “off record” to keep it off record. — Yashar Ali 🐘 (@yashar) March 29, 2019

20. She said “off record” one more time later in the call and again I just let her keep talking, I did not agree to anything. I then told her I had to go talk to my editor and she got even more frustrated and said “No. I want to talk to you about this.” — Yashar Ali 🐘 (@yashar) March 29, 2019

22. After the call with Dafna I published the stupid scoop. Then I did a gut check and over the next two hours I called 10 experienced prominent reporters and told them the story. They were all stunned by what Dafna did and encouraged me to share it publicly. — Yashar Ali 🐘 (@yashar) March 29, 2019

24. There are plenty of times reporters will introduce people in politics to other reporters or TV people. I have done it many times, that is advocating for more coverage, not less. Dafna was advocating for me to not do something on behalf of a political party. — Yashar Ali 🐘 (@yashar) March 29, 2019

25. What I can’t figure out is (and no one else I spoke to could understand), why open yourself up to this for a stupid story? How was this worth it? END — Yashar Ali 🐘 (@yashar) March 29, 2019

Zero Hedge notes Ali’s story suggests “how closely the MSM and DNC will be ‘coordinating’ efforts going into 2020.”The United States will no longer provide foreign aid to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, the State Department announced Saturday.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has ordered the State Department to cut off all aid to the three nations – collectively known as the Northern Triangle – for their failure to address the waves of caravans traveling to the U.S. southern border.

“At the Secretary’s instruction, we are carrying out the President’s direction and ending FY 2017 and FY 2018 foreign assistance programs for the Northern Triangle. We will be engaging Congress as part of this process,” a State Department spokesperson said in a statement.

President Trump warned reporters Friday that he may shut down the southern border over Mexico’s failure to stop “massive caravans” coming from the Northern Triangle.

“We have right now two big caravans coming up from Guatemala, massive caravans, walking right through Mexico,” Trump said. “So Mexico is tough, they can stop them. And if they don’t stop them, we’re closing the border.”

President Trump: "Massive caravans walking right through Mexico. So Mexico's tough. They can stop them but they chose not to. Now they're going to stop them. And if they don't stop them, we're closing the border. We'll keep it closed for a long time, I'm not playing games." pic.twitter.com/xOZI1e6Oe9 — The Hill (@thehill) March 29, 2019

“We were paying them tremendous amounts of money. And we’re not paying them anymore. Because they haven’t done a thing for us. They set up these caravans,” he added.

Mexico warned the U.S. that the “mother of all caravans” comprised of nearly 20,000 people has formed and is making its way to the border.

“We have information that a new caravan is forming in Honduras, that they’re calling ‘the mother of all caravans,’ and they are thinking it could have more than 20,000 people,” Mexico’s Interior Secretary Olga Sanchez Cordero said Wednesday.

Officials reportedly did not say how much money would be withheld by the order.

“Between last year and this year, about $1.3 billion was allocated to the region with the vast majority of it going to those three countries, according to a study from the Congressional Research Service,” CNN reported.

Facebook ‘accidentally’ deleted old posts by CEO Mark Zuckerberg during pivotal periods in the company’s history, reports Business Insider.

Zuck’s old posts – which were even reported on by news outlets at the time – have vanished, including every comment he made in 2007 and 2008.

“The most drastic deletions involved entire years. Throughout both 2006 and 2009, Zuckerberg was regularly active on the social network — but there are no posts visible of any kind for the two full years in between. The spokesperson confirmed that all the posts during 2007 and 2008 were deleted.” -Business Insider

The company says the posts were “mistakenly deleted” due to “technical errors.”

“A few years ago some of Mark’s posts were mistakenly deleted due to technical errors. The work required to restore them would have been extensive and not guaranteed to be successful so we didn’t do it,” reads a statement by a spokesperson.

“We agree people should be able to find information about past announcements and major company news, which is why for years we’ve shared and archived this information publicly — first on our blog and in recent years on our Newsroom.”

“These disappearances, along with other changes Facebook has made to how it saves its archive of announcements and blog posts, make it much harder to parse the social network’s historical record. This makes it far more difficult to hold the company, and Zuckerberg himself, accountable to past statements — particularly during a period of intense scrutiny of the company in the wake of a string of scandals.”

“The very nature of the issue means it is extremely challenging to make a full accounting of what exactly what has gone missing over the years. The spokesperson said they didn’t know how many posts in total were deleted.” -Business Insider

One such deleted post which was widely reported (and now no longer works) was an important document in Facebook’s history, as Zuckerberg promised during the April 2012 acquisition of Instagram that “we’re committed to building and growing Instagram independently,” – a commitment the company never stuck to, while Instagram’s two co-founders departed last year amid clashes with the 34-year-old billionaire CEO.

Harder to search the archives

According to the report, Facebook has also made it more difficult to navigate its dedicated announcement blog – after launching their new “Newsroom” for key announcements – the ability to search for old posts has all but been disabled.

“Now, when you click on a link to a blog post included in an old news story, it redirects you to the Newsroom. The Newsroom doesn’t have copies of many of these old blog posts, meaning there’s no easy way to access them.”

“They do still exist in one form — as a “note” saved to Facebook’s public “Facebook” page on the social network. But until today there was no centralized archive through which to browse them, like what was available for the Facebook blog, or like what exists today for Newsroom posts.”

“Instead, to read a specific one, you had to either know about it already and search for keywords on Google, or scroll back through the Facebook page’s thousands of posts over the years”. -Business Insider

Facebook added a “notes” tab to the Facebook page to access the old entries after BI contacted them for the story – which notes that “The net effect of this change to the archives was to drastically obfuscate Facebook’s historical record — making it far harder to find past statements and announcements from the company about itself.”

In April 2018, controversy erupted when TechCrunch reported that messages sent by Zuckerberg were being deleted in other people’s inboxes without their knowledge or consent. The feature was not available to other users at the time.

Meanwhile The Verge noted in November 2016 that Zuckerberg’s public posts about the media and Facebook’s role in the 2016 US election had disappeared.

The volume of censorship now taking place in America is unprecedented as well as ominous. Alex explains that now is the time for patriots to stand up before Big Tech fully turns America into China.


Facebook ‘accidentally’ deleted old posts by CEO Mark Zuckerberg during pivotal periods in the company’s history, reports Business Insider.

Zuck’s old posts – which were even reported on by news outlets at the time – have vanished, including every comment he made in 2007 and 2008.

“The most drastic deletions involved entire years. Throughout both 2006 and 2009, Zuckerberg was regularly active on the social network — but there are no posts visible of any kind for the two full years in between. The spokesperson confirmed that all the posts during 2007 and 2008 were deleted.” -Business Insider

The company says the posts were “mistakenly deleted” due to “technical errors.”

“A few years ago some of Mark’s posts were mistakenly deleted due to technical errors. The work required to restore them would have been extensive and not guaranteed to be successful so we didn’t do it,” reads a statement by a spokesperson.

“We agree people should be able to find information about past announcements and major company news, which is why for years we’ve shared and archived this information publicly — first on our blog and in recent years on our Newsroom.”

“These disappearances, along with other changes Facebook has made to how it saves its archive of announcements and blog posts, make it much harder to parse the social network’s historical record. This makes it far more difficult to hold the company, and Zuckerberg himself, accountable to past statements — particularly during a period of intense scrutiny of the company in the wake of a string of scandals.”

“The very nature of the issue means it is extremely challenging to make a full accounting of what exactly what has gone missing over the years. The spokesperson said they didn’t know how many posts in total were deleted.” -Business Insider

One such deleted post which was widely reported (and now no longer works) was an important document in Facebook’s history, as Zuckerberg promised during the April 2012 acquisition of Instagram that “we’re committed to building and growing Instagram independently,” – a commitment the company never stuck to, while Instagram’s two co-founders departed last year amid clashes with the 34-year-old billionaire CEO.

Harder to search the archives

According to the report, Facebook has also made it more difficult to navigate its dedicated announcement blog – after launching their new “Newsroom” for key announcements – the ability to search for old posts has all but been disabled.

“Now, when you click on a link to a blog post included in an old news story, it redirects you to the Newsroom. The Newsroom doesn’t have copies of many of these old blog posts, meaning there’s no easy way to access them.”

“They do still exist in one form — as a “note” saved to Facebook’s public “Facebook” page on the social network. But until today there was no centralized archive through which to browse them, like what was available for the Facebook blog, or like what exists today for Newsroom posts.”

“Instead, to read a specific one, you had to either know about it already and search for keywords on Google, or scroll back through the Facebook page’s thousands of posts over the years”. -Business Insider

Facebook added a “notes” tab to the Facebook page to access the old entries after BI contacted them for the story – which notes that “The net effect of this change to the archives was to drastically obfuscate Facebook’s historical record — making it far harder to find past statements and announcements from the company about itself.”

In April 2018, controversy erupted when TechCrunch reported that messages sent by Zuckerberg were being deleted in other people’s inboxes without their knowledge or consent. The feature was not available to other users at the time.

Meanwhile The Verge noted in November 2016 that Zuckerberg’s public posts about the media and Facebook’s role in the 2016 US election had disappeared.

Freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) on Friday blamed an anonymous staffer for the early rollout of the Green New Deal FAQ, which was widely-mocked for saying there would be a guarantee of economic security even for those “unwilling to work” and calling for the elimination of “farting cows.”

During a town hall that aired on MSNBC Friday night, Ocasio-Cortez was asked by host Chris Hayes whether she thought that office rolled out the Green New Deal the right way.

“What I will say is that I definitely had a staffer that had a very bad day at work and did release a working draft early, so I get that that’s what they are seizing on,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “Really what we need to do is have a serious conversation and even in those draft versions what they were talking about is really about the fact that we need to innovate on technology.”

She went on to reference “cow flatulence,” prompting Hayes to interject, “It sounds ridiculous, but it literally is an issue.”

Attorney General William Barr is a “stooge” for President Trump coordinating “a high-tech coup” by announcing that Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report found no collusion, said late night host Bill Maher.

On Friday’s HBO show “Real Time,” Maher accused “dictator” Trump of hiring Barr for the sole purpose of being exonerated by him.

“You know, high-tech lynching. Remember that phrase? This is like a high-tech coup,” Maher told his guest panel. “I know Barr is an esteemed person, William Barr. He’s a stooge. This is what Third World countries do. The dictator appoints somebody who exonerates him. That’s what happened here.”

Additionally, Maher said, Barr’s announcement last week was simply to provide cover for Trump when Mueller’s full report is released a few weeks later when the true nature of the collusion is revealed.

“I think the whole point of what Barr did was to give Trump a month-long lead to get out there and do the end zone dance, put the bullshit out, I’m completely exonerated. Because then, when we come up with the other stuff, it’s a month later, and then we’re like undoing something.”

Barr released a 4-page summary last weekend outlining Mueller’s main findings, which concluded the Trump campaign did not collude with Russia and Trump did not obstruct justice during the course of the “investigation.”

Media companies are refusing to air advertisements for an anti-abortion movie that criticizes the practices of Planned Parenthood.

The Hallmark Channel, Lifetime, and media properties owned by the Discovery conglomerate are among the organizations that rejected the movie’s advertisements. The movie’s producers says that Fox News Channel is the only mainstream media outlet to have accepted its advertisements.

The movie, “Unplanned,” premiered in 1,000 movie theaters across the nation. Pure Flix, the production company behind the film, primarily targets Christian and social conservative audiences. Its feature “God’s Not Dead” grossed over $62 million on a $2 million budget, according to box office releases in 2014.

President Donald Trump on Friday called on The Washington Post and New York Times to be stripped of Pulitzer Prizes that the newspapers received last year for reporting on Russiagate.

So funny that The New York Times & The Washington Post got a Pulitzer Prize for their coverage (100% NEGATIVE and FAKE!) of Collusion with Russia – And there was No Collusion! So, they were either duped or corrupt? In any event, their prizes should be taken away by the Committee! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2019

The Post and Times shared the 2018 Pulitzer for a series of reports on developments in the Russia investigation.

Many of the core allegations in the reports were undercut with the recent revelation that special counsel Robert Mueller did not find collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian government.

“The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities,” Mueller wrote in his 400-page report, according to Attorney General William Barr. (RELATED: Mueller: No Collusion)

According to Barr, Mueller also did not establish “that any U.S. person or Trump campaign official or associate” conspired or “knowingly coordinated” with Russian efforts to use social media platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 campaign or to hack Democrats’ emails and disseminate them online.

On Sunday, after Barr released the summary of Mueller’s findings, Donald Trump Jr. also blasted The Post and Times over their award-winning reports.

They should convert those Pulitzer’s to #fakenews awards. How do you win a reporting award for reporting fake news? There should be a recall. Those Pulitzer’s were earned like Liz Warren’s tenure. https://t.co/5Bak6VTQ5G — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) March 24, 2019

In announcing the awards in April 2018, the Pulitzer committee praised the Post and Times’ Russia reporting.

The Post and Times received the award “for deeply sourced, relentlessly reported coverage in the public interest that dramatically furthered the nation’s understanding of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and its connections to the Trump campaign, the President-elect’s transition team and his eventual administration,” the committee said.

None of the 20 stories cited by the Pulitzer committee have come under particular scrutiny. But most furthered the narrative of collusion between the Trump team and Russia.

President Trump gave a rousing speech in Michigan where he went on offense against the MSM and the Deep State. Alex Jones gives his take on the future for President Trump’s America first agenda.

Former President Barack Obama’s DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson said Thursday that the U.S. is “truly in a crisis” at the southern border.

“A little bit of context here. When I was in office in Kirstjen Nielsen’s job, at her desk, I’d get to work around 6:30 in the morning, and there would be my intelligence book sitting on my desk, the PDB, and also the apprehension numbers from the day before,” Johnson said during his appearance on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.”

“My staff would tell you if it was under 1,000 apprehension the day before, that was a relatively good number, and if it was above 1,000, it was a relatively bad number, and I was going to be in a bad mood the whole day.”

“On Tuesday there were 4,000 apprehensions. I know that a thousand overwhelms the system. I can’t imagine what 4,000 a day looks like. So, we are truly in a crisis,” he continued.

A caravan migrant from Honduras who complained about being given beans to eat during her journey through Mexico is now in a Texas jail facing one charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.

The woman became the topic of a viral video during her journey. The woman’s sister is also facing similar charges and both have an immigration detainer placed on them preventing them from bonding out.

Jail records from Dallas County jail revealed that Mirian Zelaya and Mirna Zelaya are both being held in a detention center on a charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.

While jail records do not reveal the details that led to the charge, the news outlet Mundo Hispanico revealed that the two women allegedly beat another woman who was providing them with housing.

President Donald Trump is threatening to close parts of the U.S.-Mexican border as record numbers of migrants surge through the legal loopholes created by Congress and judges.

“CONGRESS MUST CHANGE OUR WEAK IMMIGRATION LAWS NOW … If Mexico doesn’t immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States throug [sic] our Southern Border, I will be CLOSING….. ….the Border, or large sections of the Border, next week,” he said in a series of three tweets Friday morning.

The DEMOCRATS have given us the weakest immigration laws anywhere in the World. Mexico has the strongest, & they make more than $100 Billion a year on the U.S. Therefore, CONGRESS MUST CHANGE OUR WEAK IMMIGRATION LAWS NOW, & Mexico must stop illegals from entering the U.S…. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2019

This would be so easy for Mexico to do, but they just take our money and “talk.” Besides, we lose so much money with them, especially when you add in drug trafficking etc.), that the Border closing would be a good thing! — Donald J.

Border officials are ramping up their estimates for the number of migrants who will grab the opportunity created by Congress. Predictions for 2019 have climbed from 900,000 to 1.2 million during the last few weeks.

Citing a ‘high-level source,’ Rand Paul says former CIA Director John Brennan grew frustrated that no one was giving credence to the Clinton-funded dossier, so he attached it to an intelligence report, ensuring that it would be seen by President Obama and President-elect Trump.

BREAKING: A high-level source tells me it was Brennan who insisted that the unverified and fake Steele dossier be included in the Intelligence Report… Brennan should be asked to testify under oath in Congress ASAP. — Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) March 27, 2019

Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) told Breitbart News exclusively on Wednesday that President Donald Trump told senators at the weekly GOP luncheon that he backs his call for an investigation into the origins of the Russia scandal “hoax” that Trump has now been cleared of by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.

“The president was at lunch today and he voiced his support for investigating the people who concocted this hoax,” Paul told Breitbart News. “He didn’t use the word hoax, those are my words, but I think we should get to the bottom of this and he believes we should get to the bottom of this because this should never happen to another president. He feels that it’s damaging to the country, damaging to the ability to lead the country, that we basically—somebody within the Obama administration, within the DOJ and the FBI, basically concocted an investigation, trumped it up to be something that it wasn’t and then we’ve gone through two years of the country being stalled because of this fake investigation.”

Rand exclaimed (at around 3: 02): “Officials must be asked under oath what Obama knew, and when…”



When asked specifically if former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, former CIA Director John Brennan, and former National Security Adviser Susan Rice should be called to testify about their role in the matter – and be subpoenaed to force their testimony if they refuse to voluntarily comply.



Colorado’s Senate passed the so-called ‘red flag bill’ that allows law enforcement to seize people’s guns if a court rules them at risk to themselves or others. Millie Weaver joins Alex to discuss the Big Tech smear machine.

Paul said:

“Absolutely. We have John Brennan, who lied to us, who spied on the Senate and tapped into Senate computers,” Paul said. “We have James Clapper who came before the Intelligence Committee and said they weren’t collecting all of our phone data. So both Brennan and Clapper have been known to lie in official testimony. They should be brought forward and asked what was their part? What was their role in ginning up this dossier? Amazingly, most media outlets wouldn’t even print the dossier because they thought it was so unsubstantiated. And then all of a sudden, the FBI gives it credence. There’s one interesting story out today that says still no one would print it, so then Comey gives it to President Trump and that’s when it’s been leaked and then we have a news story saying that this dossier had been given to the president and that became the hook or the story.” “I think it’s a terrible tragedy,” Paul said of the investigation. “It cost us $30 million, two years to go through all of this, the media has been so consumed by all of this that they have barely had time to report on any of the real news of the day. I think we shouldn’t allow this to happen again to a Republican or a Democrat.”

For now, the full Mueller report is not yet public—and Paul said he intends to object to its full release until such time as all the documents regarding the Obama administration’s abuse of power to start this “hoax” investigation are also released.

“My plan is to object to the release of the Mueller report and/or all of the Mueller information until they also release the complete information from the White House, DOJ, FBI, on why they chose to credit the dossier,” Paul said. “What were the discussions? And who was it who was promoting that the dossier was real? How did it come about? How were all these judgments made? So, the other side wants to read a million pages of Mueller report. We’re going to want to read a million pages of how this whole Russian hoax got started.”

This is the first part of a lengthy interview with Sen. Paul on Spygate in the wake of the Mueller probe clearing President Trump on all matters. More is forthcoming soon…

And who was it who was promoting that the dossier was real? How did it come about? How were all these judgments made? So, the other side wants to read a million pages of Mueller report. We’re going to want to read a million pages of how this whole Russian hoax got started.”

This is the first part of a lengthy interview with Sen. Paul on Spygate in the wake of the Mueller probe clearing President Trump on all matters. More is forthcoming soon…


Update: In response to Barr’s letter announcing the upcoming release of a redacted version of the Mueller report, Chairman Nadler said: “As I informed the Attorney General..Congress requires the full and complete Mueller report, without redactions, as well as access to the underlying evidence, by April 2. That deadline still stands.”

Attorney General William Barr wrote a Friday letter in response to Senate Judiciary Chair Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) notifying them that a redacted copy of the Mueller report will be delivered to Congress, then available to the public, by mid-April “if not sooner.”

“Everyone will soon be able to read it on their own,” wrote Barr.



Alex Jones breaks the news that Joseph Farah, founder and editor-in-chief of World Net Daily, has suffered a serious stroke. Patriots around the world, please send him your prayers.

Barr says that his office is working with Special Counsel Robert Mueller to redact sensitive information which could affect ongoing matters, infringe on someone’s personal privacy or information which could compromise the DOJ’s sources and methods of investigation.

The report will be nearly 400 pages, while Barr writes that there is no plans to let the White House review it beforehand.

“Although the president would have the right to assert privilege over certain parts of the report, he has stated publicly that he intends to defer to me and, accordingly, there are no plans to submit the report to the White House for a privilege review.”

Barr also disputes the characterization that a four-page letter released on Sunday was a “summary” of Mueller’s report.

“My March 24 letter was not, and did not purport to be, an exhaustive recounting of the Special Counsel’s investigation or report,” writes Barr. “As my letter made clear, my notification to Congress and the public provided, pending release of the report, a summary of its “principal conclusions” — that is, its bottom line. The Special Counsel’s report is nearly 400 pages long (exclusive of tables and appendices) and sets forth the Special Counsel’s findings, his analysis, and the reasons for his conclusions. . . . I do not believe it would be in the public’s interest for me to attempt to summarize the full report or to release it in serial or piecemeal fashion.”

Barr then says he will be available to testify in front of Congress on May 1 and 2.

Former Nevada State Assemblywoman Lucy Flores detailed, in a piece for The Cut, a very awkward and uncomfortable encounter she had with former Vice President Joe Biden in 2014.

Flores was the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor in Nevada in 2014, and she recounts how Biden came to the state ahead of the election to campaign.

At the event in question, Flores says she felt Biden’s hands on her shoulders:

I felt him get closer to me from behind. He leaned further in and inhaled my hair. I was mortified. I thought to myself, “I didn’t wash my hair today and the vice-president of the United States is smelling it. And also, what in the actual fuck? Why is the vice-president of the United States smelling my hair?” He proceeded to plant a big slow kiss on the back of my head. My brain couldn’t process what was happening. I was embarrassed. I was shocked. I was confused. There is a Spanish saying, “tragame tierra,” it means, “earth, swallow me whole.” I couldn’t move and I couldn’t say anything. I wanted nothing more than to get Biden away from me. My name was called and I was never happier to get on stage in front of an audience.

She writes that Biden’s behavior was “blatantly inappropriate and unnerving” and he made her feel “uneasy, gross, and confused.”

The BBC was ordered to pay damages after the far-left outlet published fake news claiming Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko “authorized” an illegal payment of $400,000 to Michael Cohen for additional face time during a June 2017 meeting with President Trump.

“We apologize to Mr. Poroshenko for any distress caused and have agreed to pay him damages, legal costs and have participated in a joint statement in open court,” the BBC’s said in a written apology published Thursday.

In the May 2018 piece, the disgraced BBC made the absurd claim that Poroshenko, who already had a meeting set up with Trump, paid this $400,000 to extend the meeting.

Think about how well this utterly deranged piece of fake news fits into the overall media’s Russia Collusion Hoax.

Poroshenko is an aggressive opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin, so naturally the only way he could get serious face time with Trump (aka Putin’s Stooge) is through a six-figure bribe. Michael Cohen was still the president’s personal lawyer at this time, which means the media were desperate for us to see Cohen as Trump’s world-traveling bagman, because that would lend credibility to the phony dossier’s lie about Cohen visiting Prague to pay off the hackers who got Hillary’s emails. The story openly insinuates Trump is both in Putin’s pocket and accepting bribes.

A left-leaning news editor claims he was bullied to hold off on publishing a story, regarding the upcoming Democrat debates, by MSNBC’s politics editor working “on behalf of the DNC.”

In a lengthy thread published on Twitter Friday, New York Magazine and Huffington Post contributor Yashar Ali called out Dafna Linzer, NBC News & MSNBC politics managing editor, over a threatening phone call in which she insisted he not publish a story in order to give the DNC more time to prepare.

Ali says Linzer called after he had phoned the DNC to fact check the story before publishing it in his personal newsletter. During the call the DNC also requested he delay the story for about an hour, to which he refused because the news could leak during that time leaving him without a scoop.

“After exchanging pleasantries, Dafna told me that she received a call from the DNC and was told I had a story,” Ali documented in several tweets. “Now it’s not strange that the DNC called her, they were coordinating an announcement. What was strange was that she was calling me and taking a menacing tone.”

“She asked if I could hold the story and I said I couldn’t. She was agitated, ‘why not?’ I said I’m not going to lose a scoop. Then she got angrier and said ‘Why not? It’s not a big deal, let them make a few phone calls.'”

Ali says he still can’t figure out why Linzer would stick her neck on the line for what he considered a “stupid scoop,” but that he felt compelled to expose Linzer’s “bad behavior” publicly after speaking with colleagues and feeling she “advocated for me to not do something on behalf of a political party.”

2. Dafna, who oversees the political coverage for NBC and MSNBC, was calling to bully me into delaying the publication of an innocuous scoop and at no point did she advocate for her network, it was only about the DNC. Here’s how this all started… — Yashar Ali  (@yashar) March 29, 2019

4. At first I thought it was just a fun tidbit that I could tweet out. But after I called several presidential campaign staffers I learn that all the Dem campaigns were desperate to learn what the dates were going to be. I decided to post the scoop as an item in my newsletter. — Yashar Ali  (@yashar) March 29, 2019

6. So I won’t share most of what was said but can tell you it’s pretty run-of-the mill stuff. I asked the DNC if my tip was accurate and they asked if they could call me back in 10 minutes. A few minutes later they called back and asked if I could delay posting my scoop — Yashar Ali  (@yashar) March 29, 2019

8. I’ve never spoken to Dafna by phone. A couple years ago she reached out to me to see if I wanted to have coffee and talk about working at NBC News but I declined as I was actively investigating NBC matters and thought it would be strange if I discussed a job. — Yashar Ali  (@yashar) March 29, 2019

10. After exchanging pleasantries, Dafna told me that she received a call from the DNC and was told I had a story. Now it’s not strange that the DNC called her, they were coordinating an announcement. What was strange was that she was calling me and taking a menacing tone — Yashar Ali  (@yashar) March 29, 2019

12. I realized that @DafnaLinzer, the head of all political coverage for NBC News and MSNBC wasn’t calling to advocate for her network, she was calling to advocate the DNC’s position. She wanted me to wait so they could call state party leaders. — Yashar Ali  (@yashar) March 29, 2019

14. I would lose a scoop. Dafna reminded me she was a nat sec reporter at WAPO for ten years and they would hold stuff all the time (note: so people wouldn’t get killed). “Why can’t you just wait, let them make their calls, then you’ll be the first to put it into print,” she said — Yashar Ali  (@yashar) March 29, 2019

16. I kept telling Dafna no, that I wasn’t waiting. And she kept getting more frustrated. She was exasperated…she didn’t understand why I couldn’t wait for the DNC to make their state notification calls. — Yashar Ali  (@yashar) March 29, 2019

18. 2/3 of the way into the conversation Dafna started a sentence with “this is off the record.” She hadn’t said it at the beginning of our conversation and most important at no point did I agree when she said “off record” to keep it off record. — Yashar Ali  (@yashar) March 29, 2019

20. She said “off record” one more time later in the call and again I just let her keep talking, I did not agree to anything. I then told her I had to go talk to my editor and she got even more frustrated and said “No. I want to talk to you about this.” — Yashar Ali  (@yashar) March 29, 2019

22. After the call with Dafna I published the stupid scoop. Then I did a gut check and over the next two hours I called 10 experienced prominent reporters and told them the story. They were all stunned by what Dafna did and encouraged me to share it publicly. — Yashar Ali  (@yashar) March 29, 2019

24. There are plenty of times reporters will introduce people in politics to other reporters or TV people. I have done it many times, that is advocating for more coverage, not less. Dafna was advocating for me to not do something on behalf of a political party. — Yashar Ali  (@yashar) March 29, 2019

25. What I can’t figure out is (and no one else I spoke to could understand), why open yourself up to this for a stupid story? How was this worth it? END — Yashar Ali  (@yashar) March 29, 2019

Zero Hedge notes Ali’s story suggests “how closely the MSM and DNC will be ‘coordinating’ efforts going into 2020.”

Despite residents rapidly fleeing Illinois, the state is considering a ‘music tax’ to try to stop the hemorrhaging of its pension funds.

Illinois is looking into a new tax on Internet streaming as well as raising its vehicle registration and gas taxes to almost the highest in the nation.

The state is buckling under a staggering $134 billion in over 650 unfunded pensions, mainly for police and fire departments.

A state bill entitled the Video Service Tax Modernization Act would impose taxes on Internet streaming such as Spotify and Netflix “for the privilege to witness, view, or otherwise enjoy the entertainment.”

The tax is similar to Chicago’s “amusement tax” forced on city residents back in November to watch Netflix and play Playstation games on-line, as previously reported.

“The legality of Chicago’s ‘Netflix tax’ is dubious,” stated IllinoisPolicy.org. “The Liberty Justice Center, the Illinois Policy Institute’s litigation partner, sued the city on behalf of streaming service customers in 2015, after the expansion of the tax to online services went into effect.”

“The Center argued expanding the tax to online services violates the 1998 Internet Tax Freedom Act, a federal law.”

This federal law prohibits states from enacting taxes against electronic commerce, meaning that Illinois’ proposed statewide law could be struck down.

Illinois is also considering hiking its gas and transportation taxes.

“Legislation introduced last week proposes the state’s first gas tax increase since 1990 and could raise an additional $2 billion in revenue each year, the Chicago Tribune reported,” read an article from the AP. “But it also would hike the electric-vehicle fee from $17.50 to $148, and increase truck registration fees by $100.”

“The fees for driver’s licenses would double under the proposal, from $30 to $60, while passenger vehicle registration would increase from $98 to $148.”

Two billion dollars is roughly only 1.5% of the amount needed to fund the state’s pension funds, however.

Additionally, another problem plagues Illinois: all these new taxes are motivating residents to flee the state.

Not only is Illinois within the top five states with the highest tax burdens, it’s also one of the top five states residents are moving out of.

In other words, if Illinois increases taxes, residents will move out, thus shrinking the tax revenues.

Congressional Democrats are displaying ‘Transgender Equality’ flags outside their offices in protest of the so-called military ‘trans ban’ proposed by the Trump administration.

The National Center for Transgender Awareness announced that the flags had been delivered to every member of Congress as part of ‘Trans Visibility Week.’

“To mark this year’s Trans Visibility Week, we’ve done something UNPRECEDENTED: With the help of community members & volunteers, we delivered trans pride flags to EVERY member of the Congress, from every party, including voting members and non-voting delegates,” the group tweeted. “Our request: Fly them outside your office for Trans Visibility Week.”

Many Democrats have complied, sharing photographs to social media calling the military policy “hateful” and an act of “bigotry.”

House Democrats passed a non-binding resolution opposing the partial ban on transgender military personnel this week. Only five House Republicans joined them.

The Supreme Court has ruled the restrictions can be implemented, however transgender troops will reportedly be allowed to serve if they do so as their biological sex, and other transgender personnel already serving will be grandfathered in.

A Smithsonian poll published in January revealed only 39% of active and retired servicepeople supported transgenders serving in the military.

An elderly French woman who suffered skull fractures and brain hemorrhaging when riot police stormed a crowd at 'Yellow Vest' demonstrations was scolded and discredited by President Macron and the mayor of Nice, according to reports.

Genevieve Legay, 73, who has been described as an anti-capitalist activist, was reportedly waving a rainbow-colored "flag of peace" when police in riot gear and shields charged into a group of protestors, seeming to knock her violently to the pavement.

Video footage of the fray shows Legay lying apparently unconscious on the ground, blood pouring from her face as officers surround her and one checks her vital signs.

When asked to comment on the episode during an interview with Nice-Matin, French president Emmanuel Macron responded, "I wish her a quick recovery, and I also wish her more wisdom. A fragile person, who is at risk of being pushed down, shouldn’t go to unauthorized marches or put themselves in such a situation."

French television hosts later analyzed "information distortion" about the incident delivered to reporters by Nice mayor Christian Estrosi, who claimed Legay had fallen on her own and only suffered minor injuries.

"Yes, I know, it’s a shame, since I know that it wasn’t in a clash with the police; she stumbled," Estrosi said. "Of course every person who is wounded today, whether in these circumstances or others – it's always unfortunate, but I think that those are superficial wounds."

According to Legay's daughter and follow-up reports, she suffered skull fractures, brain hemorrhaging, and five broken ribs in the melee and is recovering in hospital.

When asked to comment on the episode during an interview with Nice-Matin, French president Emmanuel Macron responded, "I wish her a quick recovery, and I also wish her more wisdom. A fragile person, who is at risk of being pushed down, shouldn’t go to unauthorized marches or put themselves in such a situation."

French television hosts later analyzed "information distortion" about the incident delivered to reporters by Nice mayor Christian Estrosi, who claimed Legay had fallen on her own and only suffered minor injuries.

"Yes, I know, it’s a shame, since I know that it wasn’t in a clash with the police; she stumbled," Estrosi said. "Of course every person who is wounded today, whether in these circumstances or others – it's always unfortunate, but I think that those are superficial wounds."

According to Legay's daughter and follow-up reports, she suffered skull fractures, brain hemorrhaging, and five broken ribs in the melee and is recovering in hospital.

An airport in New York has rejected Chick-fil-A from an upcoming food court project, making it the second airport to ban the restaurant in as many weeks.

On Friday, Democratic New York State Assemblyman Sean Ryan applauded the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority (NFTA) for its decision to ban the restaurant from the Buffalo Niagara International Airport over so-called anti-LGBTQ practices.

Update: I applaud the decision that has been made to remove Chick-fil-A from plans for the Buffalo Niagara International Airport. Thank you to everyone who reached out to share their opinion. pic.twitter.com/HA5t1CjwkV — Assemblyman Sean Ryan (@SeanMRyan149) March 29, 2019

“Earlier today I spoke with the vendor of the Buffalo Airport food court project, and they informed me they will not be opening a Chick-fil-A as a part of their airport project,” Ryan wrote in a statement Friday. “A publicly financed facility like the Buffalo Niagara International Airport is not the appropriate venue for a Chick-fil-A restaurant. I applaud the decision that has been made to remove Chick-fil-A from the plans for this project. We hope in the future the NFTA will make every effort to contract with businesses that adhere to antidiscriminatory policies, and we’re confident another vendor who better represents the values of the Western New York community will replace Chick-fil-A as a part of this project in the very near future.”

The announcement comes one day after Ryan penned a statement criticizing the NFTA’s move to allow Chick-fil-A, after last week’s decision by the San Antonio city council to ban the restaurant from its city airport.

I'm disappointed in the @NFTA decision to bring a Chick-fil-A to the @BUFAirport. pic.twitter.com/zP0oIUOz3q — Assemblyman Sean Ryan (@SeanMRyan149) March 29, 2019

“I was disappointed to learn of the NFTA’s decision to introduce Chick-fil-A as a restaurant option at the Buffalo-Niagara International Airport,” Ryan wrote Thursday. “Chick-fil-A has a long history of supporting and funding anti-LGBTQ organizations. In fact, the San Antonio City Council recently rejected a plan to open a Chick-fil-A at the San Antonio International Airport due to the company’s discriminatory advocacy.”

A statement from Chick-fil-A to the San Antonio city council last week disputed their “misperceptions” of the company’s values, and invited them to visit any of its 32 San Antonio area restaurants.

On Thursday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton vowed to investigate the San Antonio city council’s decision to ensure it does not violate discrimination laws or infringe on the religious rights of Texans.

The City of San Antonio’s decision to exclude Chick-fil-A based on the religious beliefs associated with the company and its owners is the opposite of tolerance. It’s discriminatory, and not only out of step with Texas values, but inconsistent with the Constitution and Texas law. pic.twitter.com/iOk7G9Eltv — Ken Paxton (@KenPaxtonTX) March 28, 2019

“The Constitution’s protection of religious liberty is somehow even better than Chick-fil-A’s chicken,” Paxton wrote in a letter to San Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg. “Unfortunately, I have serious concerns that both are under assault at the San Antonio airport.”

“You should also note that I have directed my office to open an investigation into whether the City’s action violates state law,” Paxton added. “I trust the City will fully cooperate with my investigation into this matter, and will abide by relevant federal and state laws in the future.”

Chick-fil-A did not respond to Infowars’ request for comment as of writing.

No law changed.

By presidential fiat, an accessory that was allowed throughout the George W. Bush & Obama administrations was just banned and John Roberts who claimed the Constitution permitted Obamacare, has just shut down a lawsuit to stop the dangerous precedent.

Amazon was pressured into removing baby jumpsuits with highly inappropriate sayings written on them after critics pointed out the clothing was aimed at pedophiles.

One of the garments reading “Daddy’s Little F*** Toy” was being sold for $18.98 (£14.38) before being removed from Amazon’s website.

Another onesie with the phrase “I Just Look Illegal” was being sold for $20 (£15.15) by third-party Canadian vendor VanBer.

Prof. Marci Hamilton, CEO of a non-profit committed to protecting children called CHILD USA, told The Sun, “It is outrageous that baby clothing with this language appears anywhere on the web let alone Amazon.”

“I had assumed that Amazon had to clear products before they are put online. It clearly should have been ringing alarm bells – but it went online,” she continued.

An Amazon spokesperson responded: “All marketplace sellers must follow our selling guidelines, and those who don’t will be subject to action including potential removal of their account. The product in question is no longer available.”

Mindy Robinson joins Roger Stone and Owen Shroyer to expose online child predators, pedophiles and the growing acceptance of child abuse in our culture.

Meanwhile, conservative political voices are being shut out of the same social media outlets that allow child predators to thrive.

Colorado’s Senate passed the so-called ‘red flag bill’ that allows law enforcement to seize people’s guns if a court rules them at risk to themselves or others.

Thursday’s 18-17 vote, that saw no Republican support, moved the bill one step closer to Governor Jared Polis’ signature – who has already pledged to sign it into law if it reaches his desk.

The legislation, called House Bill 1177, has been slammed by the state’s sheriffs who have been supporting multiple counties’ efforts to become a “Second Amendment sanctuary.”

“If you pass an unconstitutional law, our oaths as commissioners or myself as the sheriff — we’re going to follow our constitutional oath first,” said Sheriff Steve Reams.

Advocates for the bill insist it’s intended to combat mental health issues as over half of Colorado’s suicides involve a firearm, a cause sheriffs are eager to address but not at the expense of everyone’s rights.

“It’s time we quit trying to put lipstick on a pig and start funding our mental health facilities, instead of trying to take the rights from our people,” said another sheriff.

The state’s attorney general, Democrat Phil Weiser, has called officials to leave office if they can’t “follow the law.”

“If a sheriff cannot follow the law, the sheriff cannot do his or her job,” Weiser said. “The right thing to do for a sheriff who says, ‘I can’t follow the law’ is to resign.”

Interestingly, after being pressed by the media, Governor Polis has distanced himself from Weiser’s remarks by saying police can exercise their discretion when choosing to honor the new law.

“Every law enforcement agency has limited resources, and they do have to prioritize what they choose to enforce or not enforce,” said Polis.

An Austin American-Statesman investigation found an altercation between Alex Jones and customers at a Lucy’s Fried Chicken restaurant began when the customers approached Jones’ table as he sat dining.

Speaking to a Lucy’s employee, The Statesman’s Jonathan Tilove discovered Jones was not responsible for initiating the confrontation which went viral over the weekend.

“An employee with Lucy’s told the American-Statesman that Jones, a regular customer, was in the inside seating area of the eatery off South Congress Avenue when some other customers approached his table with insults,” Tilove reported Thursday.

On Saturday, Jones and his wife were having oysters at Lucy’s when a group of leftists spotted and began berating him.

Jones initially ignored the insults, among which leftists shouted, “Fuck you, fuck your family!” and “Eat shit Alex Jones, you’re gonna get it, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!”

Videos that emerged of the event begin with Jones holding his phone up to film a group of patrons as they chant protest slogans at him.

Jones maintained the footage did not show the full context and was deceptively edited.

“They baited me like a matador does with a bull and then when I open the door, they’re all waiting with their cameras going and then edited it deceptively, because it didn’t look right because showing them chanting obscenities at me would have ruined their narrative,” Jones told Infowars.

Here’s raw footage of the incident, corroborating Jones’ version of events.

Evolutionary roboticists have decided to begin teaching artificial intelligence powered robots to evolve and reproduce. Why should humans go to the trouble of building more robots when a robot could do it instead?

According to Futurism, this is known as high-tech Darwinism. The researchers’ ultimate goal is to design artificial intelligence and robots that can analyze their own source code and mate with others by combining bits and pieces of their code with that of other robots. This would to create “offspring,” much like organic life, Futurism reported. But it isn’t actually anything like organic life, actually. But evolutionary roboticists who have this new goal have high-tech Darwinism to the extreme. Apparently, just like biological life evolves to fill ecological niches, these robots’ offspring might be better adapted to their environments that their architects specifically built them for.

An interesting future awaits once high-tech Darwinism becomes successful. And Wired reported that some scientists are well on their way to making this technology a reality.

Computer scientists at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam built a simplified system that shows how future robots might swap and combine their “genetic” information.

Their recent research, published in the journal Nature Machine Intelligence and which involved programming two parent robots to code a new “offspring,” found that the resulting offspring contain a mixture of the parents’ code as well as some modules that seemed to have mutated or been blended on its own. –Futurism

David Howard, one of the scientists on the project, told Wired that there’s a positive spin to all of this. “It gives you a lot of diversity, and it gives you the power to explore areas of a design space that you wouldn’t normally go into.” But others see this as a way to permanently force human beings into extinction. “One of the things that makes natural evolution powerful is the idea that it can really specialize a creature to an environment,” Howard told Wired.

But natural evolution doesn’t sound anything like robot evolution. Humans are making themselves obsolete and our two cents is that this will not end well for humanity.

Big Tech has gained power by absorbing personal data from its users. Brad Shear joins Alex to discuss the agenda of Big Tech and solutions for the future.

Raw elemental iodine is a controlled substance both at a State and Federal level, and Survival Shield X-2 meets all requirements in controlling it. The licensing, approvals and regulatory documentary procedures are exacting and costly, but worth it for our consumers.



Bound forms of iodine must first be separated, clarified and purified from other binding components or impurities into a USP-grade (United States Pharmaceutical), mono-elemental iodine as certified USP resublimated iodine crystals. In this purified crystal form, iodine is a highly reactive and toxic substance. However, when the purified USP iodine crystals are subjected to a proprietary process it becomes nano-colloidalized and transforms into a form of elemental nascent iodine, also referred to as monoatomic iodine, without the addition of iodides!



Shocking Statistics About Iodine



According to the World Health Organization's Department o f Nutrition for Health and Development, iodine deficiency is a public health problem in 54 countries where impure iodine sources are plentiful.

The CDC states that iodine deficiency is one of the four major deficiency diseases in the world (Thankfully, it is easily corrected).

The 2013 USGS iodine commodity summary warns that there are no comparable substitutes for iodine that will match it's benefits.

Information published by UNICEF notes that iodine deficiency is the most avoidable cause of stunted physical and intellectual development.

What Are The Health Benefits Of Nascent Iodine?



Proper iodine levels may provide support for normal response to environmental and dietary toxins to keep your body clean and moving.*

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has ordered the State Department to cut off all aid to the three nations  collectively known as the Northern Triangle  for their failure to address the waves of caravans traveling to the U.S. southern border.

At the Secretarys instruction, we are carrying out the Presidents direction and ending FY 2017 and FY 2018 foreign assistance programs for the Northern Triangle. We will be engaging Congress as part of this process, a State Department spokesperson said in a statement.

President Trump warned reporters Friday that he may shut down the southern border over Mexicos failure to stop massive caravans coming from the Northern Triangle.

We have right now two big caravans coming up from Guatemala, massive caravans, walking right through Mexico, Trump said. So Mexico is tough, they can stop them. And if they dont stop them, were closing the border.

President Trump: "Massive caravans walking right through Mexico. So Mexico's tough. They can stop them but they chose not to. Now they're going to stop them. And if they don't stop them, we're closing the border. We'll keep it closed for a long time, I'm not playing games." pic.twitter.com/xOZI1e6Oe9  The Hill (@thehill) March 29, 2019

We were paying them tremendous amounts of money. And were not paying them anymore. Because they havent done a thing for us. They set up these caravans, he added.

Mexico warned the U.S. that the mother of all caravans comprised of nearly 20,000 people has formed and is making its way to the border.

We have information that a new caravan is forming in Honduras, that theyre calling the mother of all caravans, and they are thinking it could have more than 20,000 people, Mexicos Interior Secretary Olga Sanchez Cordero said Wednesday.

Officials reportedly did not say how much money would be withheld by the order.

Between last year and this year, about $1.3 billion was allocated to the region with the vast majority of it going to those three countries, according to a study from the Congressional Research Service, CNN reported.

Alex Jones presents a report produced by CNN where Latino voters living along the border in Texas make it completely clear that they want the wall, and in fact, they want it taller and longer than its current construction.

Facebook accidentally deleted old posts by CEO Mark Zuckerberg during pivotal periods in the companys history, reports Business Insider.

Zucks old posts  which were even reported on by news outlets at the time  have vanished, including every comment he made in 2007 and 2008.

The most drastic deletions involved entire years. Throughout both 2006 and 2009, Zuckerberg was regularly active on the social network  but there are no posts visible of any kind for the two full years in between. The spokesperson confirmed that all the posts during 2007 and 2008 were deleted. -Business Insider

The company says the posts were mistakenly deleted due to technical errors.

A few years ago some of Marks posts were mistakenly deleted due to technical errors. The work required to restore them would have been extensive and not guaranteed to be successful so we didnt do it, reads a statement by a spokesperson.

We agree people should be able to find information about past announcements and major company news, which is why for years weve shared and archived this information publicly  first on our blog and in recent years on our Newsroom.

These disappearances, along with other changes Facebook has made to how it saves its archive of announcements and blog posts, make it much harder to parse the social networks historical record. This makes it far more difficult to hold the company, and Zuckerberg himself, accountable to past statements  particularly during a period of intense scrutiny of the company in the wake of a string of scandals.

The very nature of the issue means it is extremely challenging to make a full accounting of what exactly what has gone missing over the years. The spokesperson said they didnt know how many posts in total were deleted. -Business Insider

One such deleted post which was widely reported (and now no longer works) was an important document in Facebooks history, as Zuckerberg promised during the April 2012 acquisition of Instagram that were committed to building and growing Instagram independently,  a commitment the company never stuck to, while Instagrams two co-founders departed last year amid clashes with the 34-year-old billionaire CEO.

Harder to search the archives

According to the report, Facebook has also made it more difficult to navigate its dedicated announcement blog  after launching their new Newsroom for key announcements  the ability to search for old posts has all but been disabled.

Now, when you click on a link to a blog post included in an old news story, it redirects you to the Newsroom. The Newsroom doesnt have copies of many of these old blog posts, meaning theres no easy way to access them.

They do still exist in one form  as a note saved to Facebooks public Facebook page on the social network. But until today there was no centralized archive through which to browse them, like what was available for the Facebook blog, or like what exists today for Newsroom posts.

Instead, to read a specific one, you had to either know about it already and search for keywords on Google, or scroll back through the Facebook pages thousands of posts over the years. -Business Insider

Facebook added a notes tab to the Facebook page to access the old entries after BI contacted them for the story  which notes that The net effect of this change to the archives was to drastically obfuscate Facebooks historical record  making it far harder to find past statements and announcements from the company about itself.

In April 2018, controversy erupted when TechCrunch reported that messages sent by Zuckerberg were being deleted in other peoples inboxes without their knowledge or consent. The feature was not available to other users at the time.

Meanwhile The Verge noted in November 2016 that Zuckerbergs public posts about the media and Facebooks role in the 2016 US election had disappeared.

The volume of censorship now taking place in America is unprecedented as well as ominous. Alex explains that now is the time for patriots to stand up before Big Tech fully turns America into China.

Freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) on Friday blamed an anonymous staffer for the early rollout of the Green New Deal FAQ, which was widely-mocked for saying there would be a guarantee of economic security even for those unwilling to work and calling for the elimination of farting cows.

During a town hall that aired on MSNBC Friday night, Ocasio-Cortez was asked by host Chris Hayes whether she thought that office rolled out the Green New Deal the right way.

What I will say is that I definitely had a staffer that had a very bad day at work and did release a working draft early, so I get that thats what they are seizing on, Ocasio-Cortez said. Really what we need to do is have a serious conversation and even in those draft versions what they were talking about is really about the fact that we need to innovate on technology.

She went on to reference cow flatulence, prompting Hayes to interject, It sounds ridiculous, but it literally is an issue.

Attorney General William Barr is a stooge for President Trump coordinating a high-tech coup by announcing that Special Counsel Robert Muellers report found no collusion, said late night host Bill Maher.

On Fridays HBO show Real Time, Maher accused dictator Trump of hiring Barr for the sole purpose of being exonerated by him.

You know, high-tech lynching. Remember that phrase? This is like a high-tech coup, Maher told his guest panel. I know Barr is an esteemed person, William Barr. Hes a stooge. This is what Third World countries do. The dictator appoints somebody who exonerates him. Thats what happened here.

Additionally, Maher said, Barrs announcement last week was simply to provide cover for Trump when Muellers full report is released a few weeks later when the true nature of the collusion is revealed.

I think the whole point of what Barr did was to give Trump a month-long lead to get out there and do the end zone dance, put the bullshit out, Im completely exonerated. Because then, when we come up with the other stuff, its a month later, and then were like undoing something.

Barr released a 4-page summary last weekend outlining Muellers main findings, which concluded the Trump campaign did not collude with Russia and Trump did not obstruct justice during the course of the investigation.

Alex Jones presents video footage of Texas Representative Mike Conaway calling out California Representative Adam Schiff on the house floor for his open participation in pushing propaganda on the American public that suggested President Trump colluded with the Russian Government in 2016.

President Donald Trump on Friday called on The Washington Post and New York Times to be stripped of Pulitzer Prizes that the newspapers received last year for reporting on Russiagate.

So funny that The New York Times & The Washington Post got a Pulitzer Prize for their coverage (100% NEGATIVE and FAKE!) of Collusion with Russia  And there was No Collusion! So, they were either duped or corrupt? In any event, their prizes should be taken away by the Committee!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2019

The Post and Times shared the 2018 Pulitzer for a series of reports on developments in the Russia investigation.

Many of the core allegations in the reports were undercut with the recent revelation that special counsel Robert Mueller did not find collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian government.

The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities, Mueller wrote in his 400-page report, according to Attorney General William Barr. (RELATED: Mueller: No Collusion)

According to Barr, Mueller also did not establish that any U.S. person or Trump campaign official or associate conspired or knowingly coordinated with Russian efforts to use social media platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 campaign or to hack Democrats emails and disseminate them online.

On Sunday, after Barr released the summary of Muellers findings, Donald Trump Jr. also blasted The Post and Times over their award-winning reports.

They should convert those Pulitzers to #fakenews awards. How do you win a reporting award for reporting fake news? There should be a recall. Those Pulitzers were earned like Liz Warrens tenure. https://t.co/5Bak6VTQ5G  Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) March 24, 2019

In announcing the awards in April 2018, the Pulitzer committee praised the Post and Times Russia reporting.

The Post and Times received the award for deeply sourced, relentlessly reported coverage in the public interest that dramatically furthered the nations understanding of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and its connections to the Trump campaign, the President-elects transition team and his eventual administration, the committee said.

None of the 20 stories cited by the Pulitzer committee have come under particular scrutiny. But most furthered the narrative of collusion between the Trump team and Russia.

President Trump gave a rousing speech in Michigan where he went on offense against the MSM and the Deep State. Alex Jones gives his take on the future for President Trumps America first agenda.

Former President Barack Obamas DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson said Thursday that the U.S. is truly in a crisis at the southern border.

A little bit of context here. When I was in office in Kirstjen Nielsens job, at her desk, Id get to work around 6:30 in the morning, and there would be my intelligence book sitting on my desk, the PDB, and also the apprehension numbers from the day before, Johnson said during his appearance on MSNBCs Morning Joe.

My staff would tell you if it was under 1,000 apprehension the day before, that was a relatively good number, and if it was above 1,000, it was a relatively bad number, and I was going to be in a bad mood the whole day.

On Tuesday there were 4,000 apprehensions. I know that a thousand overwhelms the system. I cant imagine what 4,000 a day looks like. So, we are truly in a crisis, he continued.

Citing a high-level source, Rand Paul says former CIA Director John Brennan grew frustrated that no one was giving credence to the Clinton-funded dossier, so he attached it to an intelligence report, ensuring that it would be seen by President Obama and President-elect Trump.

BREAKING: A high-level source tells me it was Brennan who insisted that the unverified and fake Steele dossier be included in the Intelligence Report Brennan should be asked to testify under oath in Congress ASAP.  Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) March 27, 2019

Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) told Breitbart News exclusively on Wednesday that President Donald Trump told senators at the weekly GOP luncheon that he backs his call for an investigation into the origins of the Russia scandal hoax that Trump has now been cleared of by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.

The president was at lunch today and he voiced his support for investigating the people who concocted this hoax, Paul told Breitbart News. He didnt use the word hoax, those are my words, but I think we should get to the bottom of this and he believes we should get to the bottom of this because this should never happen to another president. He feels that its damaging to the country, damaging to the ability to lead the country, that we basicallysomebody within the Obama administration, within the DOJ and the FBI, basically concocted an investigation, trumped it up to be something that it wasnt and then weve gone through two years of the country being stalled because of this fake investigation.

Rand exclaimed (at around 3: 02): Officials must be asked under oath what Obama knew, and when



When asked specifically if former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, former CIA Director John Brennan, and former National Security Adviser Susan Rice should be called to testify about their role in the matter  and be subpoenaed to force their testimony if they refuse to voluntarily comply.



Colorados Senate passed the so-called red flag bill that allows law enforcement to seize peoples guns if a court rules them at risk to themselves or others. Millie Weaver joins Alex to discuss the Big Tech smear machine.

Paul said:

Absolutely. We have John Brennan, who lied to us, who spied on the Senate and tapped into Senate computers, Paul said. We have James Clapper who came before the Intelligence Committee and said they werent collecting all of our phone data. So both Brennan and Clapper have been known to lie in official testimony. They should be brought forward and asked what was their part? What was their role in ginning up this dossier? Amazingly, most media outlets wouldnt even print the dossier because they thought it was so unsubstantiated. And then all of a sudden, the FBI gives it credence. Theres one interesting story out today that says still no one would print it, so then Comey gives it to President Trump and thats when its been leaked and then we have a news story saying that this dossier had been given to the president and that became the hook or the story. I think its a terrible tragedy, Paul said of the investigation. It cost us $30 million, two years to go through all of this, the media has been so consumed by all of this that they have barely had time to report on any of the real news of the day. I think we shouldnt allow this to happen again to a Republican or a Democrat.

For now, the full Mueller report is not yet publicand Paul said he intends to object to its full release until such time as all the documents regarding the Obama administrations abuse of power to start this hoax investigation are also released.

My plan is to object to the release of the Mueller report and/or all of the Mueller information until they also release the complete information from the White House, DOJ, FBI, on why they chose to credit the dossier, Paul said. What were the discussions? And who was it who was promoting that the dossier was real? How did it come about? How were all these judgments made? So, the other side wants to read a million pages of Mueller report. Were going to want to read a million pages of how this whole Russian hoax got started.

This is the first part of a lengthy interview with Sen. Paul on Spygate in the wake of the Mueller probe clearing President Trump on all matters. More is forthcoming soon

When asked specifically if former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, former CIA Director John Brennan, and former National Security Adviser Susan Rice should be called to testify about their role in the matter  and be subpoenaed to force their testimony if they refuse to voluntarily comply.



Colorados Senate passed the so-called red flag bill that allows law enforcement to seize peoples guns if a court rules them at risk to themselves or others. Millie Weaver joins Alex to discuss the Big Tech smear machine.

Paul said:

Absolutely. We have John Brennan, who lied to us, who spied on the Senate and tapped into Senate computers, Paul said. We have James Clapper who came before the Intelligence Committee and said they werent collecting all of our phone data. So both Brennan and Clapper have been known to lie in official testimony. They should be brought forward and asked what was their part? What was their role in ginning up this dossier? Amazingly, most media outlets wouldnt even print the dossier because they thought it was so unsubstantiated. And then all of a sudden, the FBI gives it credence. Theres one interesting story out today that says still no one would print it, so then Comey gives it to President Trump and thats when its been leaked and then we have a news story saying that this dossier had been given to the president and that became the hook or the story. I think its a terrible tragedy, Paul said of the investigation. It cost us $30 million, two years to go through all of this, the media has been so consumed by all of this that they have barely had time to report on any of the real news of the day. I think we shouldnt allow this to happen again to a Republican or a Democrat.

For now, the full Mueller report is not yet publicand Paul said he intends to object to its full release until such time as all the documents regarding the Obama administrations abuse of power to start this hoax investigation are also released.

My plan is to object to the release of the Mueller report and/or all of the Mueller information until they also release the complete information from the White House, DOJ, FBI, on why they chose to credit the dossier, Paul said. What were the discussions? And who was it who was promoting that the dossier was real? How did it come about? How were all these judgments made? So, the other side wants to read a million pages of Mueller report. Were going to want to read a million pages of how this whole Russian hoax got started.

This is the first part of a lengthy interview with Sen. Paul on Spygate in the wake of the Mueller probe clearing President Trump on all matters. More is forthcoming soon


Update: In response to Barrs letter announcing the upcoming release of a redacted version of the Mueller report, Chairman Nadler said: As I informed the Attorney General..Congress requires the full and complete Mueller report, without redactions, as well as access to the underlying evidence, by April 2. That deadline still stands.

Attorney General William Barr wrote a Friday letter in response to Senate Judiciary Chair Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) notifying them that a redacted copy of the Mueller report will be delivered to Congress, then available to the public, by mid-April if not sooner.

Everyone will soon be able to read it on their own, wrote Barr.



Alex Jones breaks the news that Joseph Farah, founder and editor-in-chief of World Net Daily, has suffered a serious stroke. Patriots around the world, please send him your prayers.

Barr says that his office is working with Special Counsel Robert Mueller to redact sensitive information which could affect ongoing matters, infringe on someones personal privacy or information which could compromise the DOJs sources and methods of investigation.

The report will be nearly 400 pages, while Barr writes that there is no plans to let the White House review it beforehand.

Although the president would have the right to assert privilege over certain parts of the report, he has stated publicly that he intends to defer to me and, accordingly, there are no plans to submit the report to the White House for a privilege review.

Barr also disputes the characterization that a four-page letter released on Sunday was a summary of Muellers report.

My March 24 letter was not, and did not purport to be, an exhaustive recounting of the Special Counsels investigation or report, writes Barr. As my letter made clear, my notification to Congress and the public provided, pending release of the report, a summary of its principal conclusions  that is, its bottom line. The Special Counsels report is nearly 400 pages long (exclusive of tables and appendices) and sets forth the Special Counsels findings, his analysis, and the reasons for his conclusions. . . . I do not believe it would be in the publics interest for me to attempt to summarize the full report or to release it in serial or piecemeal fashion.

Barr then says he will be available to testify in front of Congress on May 1 and 2.

Former Nevada State Assemblywoman Lucy Flores detailed, in a piece for The Cut, a very awkward and uncomfortable encounter she had with former Vice President Joe Biden in 2014.

Flores was the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor in Nevada in 2014, and she recounts how Biden came to the state ahead of the election to campaign.

At the event in question, Flores says she felt Bidens hands on her shoulders:

I felt him get closer to me from behind. He leaned further in and inhaled my hair. I was mortified. I thought to myself, I didnt wash my hair today and the vice-president of the United States is smelling it. And also, what in the actual fuck? Why is the vice-president of the United States smelling my hair? He proceeded to plant a big slow kiss on the back of my head. My brain couldnt process what was happening. I was embarrassed. I was shocked. I was confused. There is a Spanish saying, tragame tierra, it means, earth, swallow me whole. I couldnt move and I couldnt say anything. I wanted nothing more than to get Biden away from me. My name was called and I was never happier to get on stage in front of an audience.

She writes that Bidens behavior was blatantly inappropriate and unnerving and he made her feel uneasy, gross, and confused.

The BBC was ordered to pay damages after the far-left outlet published fake news claiming Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko authorized an illegal payment of $400,000 to Michael Cohen for additional face time during a June 2017 meeting with President Trump.

We apologize to Mr. Poroshenko for any distress caused and have agreed to pay him damages, legal costs and have participated in a joint statement in open court, the BBCs said in a written apology published Thursday.

In the May 2018 piece, the disgraced BBC made the absurd claim that Poroshenko, who already had a meeting set up with Trump, paid this $400,000 to extend the meeting.

Think about how well this utterly deranged piece of fake news fits into the overall medias Russia Collusion Hoax.

Poroshenko is an aggressive opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin, so naturally the only way he could get serious face time with Trump (aka Putins Stooge) is through a six-figure bribe. Michael Cohen was still the presidents personal lawyer at this time, which means the media were desperate for us to see Cohen as Trumps world-traveling bagman, because that would lend credibility to the phony dossiers lie about Cohen visiting Prague to pay off the hackers who got Hillarys emails. The story openly insinuates Trump is both in Putins pocket and accepting bribes.

A left-leaning news editor claims he was bullied to hold off on publishing a story, regarding the upcoming Democrat debates, by MSNBCs politics editor working on behalf of the DNC.

In a lengthy thread published on Twitter Friday, New York Magazine and Huffington Post contributor Yashar Ali called out Dafna Linzer, NBC News & MSNBC politics managing editor, over a threatening phone call in which she insisted he not publish a story in order to give the DNC more time to prepare.

Ali says Linzer called after he had phoned the DNC to fact check the story before publishing it in his personal newsletter. During the call the DNC also requested he delay the story for about an hour, to which he refused because the news could leak during that time leaving him without a scoop.

After exchanging pleasantries, Dafna told me that she received a call from the DNC and was told I had a story, Ali documented in several tweets. Now its not strange that the DNC called her, they were coordinating an announcement. What was strange was that she was calling me and taking a menacing tone.

She asked if I could hold the story and I said I couldnt. She was agitated, why not? I said Im not going to lose a scoop. Then she got angrier and said Why not? Its not a big deal, let them make a few phone calls.'

Ali says he still cant figure out why Linzer would stick her neck on the line for what he considered a stupid scoop, but that he felt compelled to expose Linzers bad behavior publicly after speaking with colleagues and feeling she advocated for me to not do something on behalf of a political party.

2. Dafna, who oversees the political coverage for NBC and MSNBC, was calling to bully me into delaying the publication of an innocuous scoop and at no point did she advocate for her network, it was only about the DNC. Heres how this all started  Yashar Ali  (@yashar) March 29, 2019

4. At first I thought it was just a fun tidbit that I could tweet out. But after I called several presidential campaign staffers I learn that all the Dem campaigns were desperate to learn what the dates were going to be. I decided to post the scoop as an item in my newsletter.  Yashar Ali  (@yashar) March 29, 2019

6. So I wont share most of what was said but can tell you its pretty run-of-the mill stuff. I asked the DNC if my tip was accurate and they asked if they could call me back in 10 minutes. A few minutes later they called back and asked if I could delay posting my scoop  Yashar Ali  (@yashar) March 29, 2019

8. Ive never spoken to Dafna by phone. A couple years ago she reached out to me to see if I wanted to have coffee and talk about working at NBC News but I declined as I was actively investigating NBC matters and thought it would be strange if I discussed a job.  Yashar Ali  (@yashar) March 29, 2019

10. After exchanging pleasantries, Dafna told me that she received a call from the DNC and was told I had a story. Now its not strange that the DNC called her, they were coordinating an announcement. What was strange was that she was calling me and taking a menacing tone  Yashar Ali  (@yashar) March 29, 2019

12. I realized that @DafnaLinzer, the head of all political coverage for NBC News and MSNBC wasnt calling to advocate for her network, she was calling to advocate the DNCs position. She wanted me to wait so they could call state party leaders.  Yashar Ali  (@yashar) March 29, 2019

14. I would lose a scoop. Dafna reminded me she was a nat sec reporter at WAPO for ten years and they would hold stuff all the time (note: so people wouldnt get killed). Why cant you just wait, let them make their calls, then youll be the first to put it into print, she said  Yashar Ali  (@yashar) March 29, 2019

16. I kept telling Dafna no, that I wasnt waiting. And she kept getting more frustrated. She was exasperatedshe didnt understand why I couldnt wait for the DNC to make their state notification calls.  Yashar Ali  (@yashar) March 29, 2019

18. 2/3 of the way into the conversation Dafna started a sentence with this is off the record. She hadnt said it at the beginning of our conversation and most important at no point did I agree when she said off record to keep it off record.  Yashar Ali  (@yashar) March 29, 2019

20. She said off record one more time later in the call and again I just let her keep talking, I did not agree to anything. I then told her I had to go talk to my editor and she got even more frustrated and said No. I want to talk to you about this.  Yashar Ali  (@yashar) March 29, 2019

22. After the call with Dafna I published the stupid scoop. Then I did a gut check and over the next two hours I called 10 experienced prominent reporters and told them the story. They were all stunned by what Dafna did and encouraged me to share it publicly.  Yashar Ali  (@yashar) March 29, 2019

24. There are plenty of times reporters will introduce people in politics to other reporters or TV people. I have done it many times, that is advocating for more coverage, not less. Dafna was advocating for me to not do something on behalf of a political party.  Yashar Ali  (@yashar) March 29, 2019

25. What I cant figure out is (and no one else I spoke to could understand), why open yourself up to this for a stupid story? How was this worth it? END  Yashar Ali  (@yashar) March 29, 2019

Zero Hedge notes Alis story suggests how closely the MSM and DNC will be coordinating efforts going into 2020.

Despite residents rapidly fleeing Illinois, the state is considering a music tax to try to stop the hemorrhaging of its pension funds.

Illinois is looking into a new tax on Internet streaming as well as raising its vehicle registration and gas taxes to almost the highest in the nation.

The state is buckling under a staggering $134 billion in over 650 unfunded pensions, mainly for police and fire departments.

A state bill entitled the Video Service Tax Modernization Act would impose taxes on Internet streaming such as Spotify and Netflix for the privilege to witness, view, or otherwise enjoy the entertainment.

The tax is similar to Chicagos amusement tax forced on city residents back in November to watch Netflix and play Playstation games on-line, as previously reported.

The legality of Chicagos Netflix tax is dubious, stated IllinoisPolicy.org. The Liberty Justice Center, the Illinois Policy Institutes litigation partner, sued the city on behalf of streaming service customers in 2015, after the expansion of the tax to online services went into effect.

The Center argued expanding the tax to online services violates the 1998 Internet Tax Freedom Act, a federal law.

This federal law prohibits states from enacting taxes against electronic commerce, meaning that Illinois proposed statewide law could be struck down.

Illinois is also considering hiking its gas and transportation taxes.

Legislation introduced last week proposes the states first gas tax increase since 1990 and could raise an additional $2 billion in revenue each year, the Chicago Tribune reported, read an article from the AP. But it also would hike the electric-vehicle fee from $17.50 to $148, and increase truck registration fees by $100.

The fees for drivers licenses would double under the proposal, from $30 to $60, while passenger vehicle registration would increase from $98 to $148.

Two billion dollars is roughly only 1.5% of the amount needed to fund the states pension funds, however.

Additionally, another problem plagues Illinois: all these new taxes are motivating residents to flee the state.

Not only is Illinois within the top five states with the highest tax burdens, its also one of the top five states residents are moving out of.

In other words, if Illinois increases taxes, residents will move out, thus shrinking the tax revenues.

Congressional Democrats are displaying Transgender Equality flags outside their offices in protest of the so-called military trans ban proposed by the Trump administration.

The National Center for Transgender Awareness announced that the flags had been delivered to every member of Congress as part of Trans Visibility Week.

To mark this years Trans Visibility Week, weve done something UNPRECEDENTED: With the help of community members & volunteers, we delivered trans pride flags to EVERY member of the Congress, from every party, including voting members and non-voting delegates, the group tweeted. Our request: Fly them outside your office for Trans Visibility Week.

Many Democrats have complied, sharing photographs to social media calling the military policy hateful and an act of bigotry.

House Democrats passed a non-binding resolution opposing the partial ban on transgender military personnel this week. Only five House Republicans joined them.

The Supreme Court has ruled the restrictions can be implemented, however transgender troops will reportedly be allowed to serve if they do so as their biological sex, and other transgender personnel already serving will be grandfathered in.

A Smithsonian poll published in January revealed only 39% of active and retired servicepeople supported transgenders serving in the military.

An elderly French woman who suffered skull fractures and brain hemorrhaging when riot police stormed a crowd at 'Yellow Vest' demonstrations was scolded and discredited by President Macron and the mayor of Nice, according to reports.

Genevieve Legay, 73, who has been described as an anti-capitalist activist, was reportedly waving a rainbow-colored "flag of peace" when police in riot gear and shields charged into a group of protestors, seeming to knock her violently to the pavement.

Video footage of the fray shows Legay lying apparently unconscious on the ground, blood pouring from her face as officers surround her and one checks her vital signs.

When asked to comment on the episode during an interview with Nice-Matin, French president Emmanuel Macron responded, "I wish her a quick recovery, and I also wish her more wisdom. A fragile person, who is at risk of being pushed down, shouldnt go to unauthorized marches or put themselves in such a situation."

French television hosts later analyzed "information distortion" about the incident delivered to reporters by Nice mayor Christian Estrosi, who claimed Legay had fallen on her own and only suffered minor injuries.

"Yes, I know, its a shame, since I know that it wasnt in a clash with the police; she stumbled," Estrosi said. "Of course every person who is wounded today, whether in these circumstances or others  it's always unfortunate, but I think that those are superficial wounds."

According to Legay's daughter and follow-up reports, she suffered skull fractures, brain hemorrhaging, and five broken ribs in the melee and is recovering in hospital.

An elderly French woman who suffered skull fractures and brain hemorrhaging when riot police stormed a crowd at 'Yellow Vest' demonstrations was scolded and discredited by President Macron and the mayor of Nice, according to reports.

Genevieve Legay, 73, who has been described as an anti-capitalist activist, was reportedly waving a rainbow-colored "flag of peace" when police in riot gear and shields charged into a group of protestors, seeming to knock her violently to the pavement.

Video footage of the fray shows Legay lying apparently unconscious on the ground, blood pouring from her face as officers surround her and one checks her vital signs.

When asked to comment on the episode during an interview with Nice-Matin, French president Emmanuel Macron responded, "I wish her a quick recovery, and I also wish her more wisdom. A fragile person, who is at risk of being pushed down, shouldnt go to unauthorized marches or put themselves in such a situation."

French television hosts later analyzed "information distortion" about the incident delivered to reporters by Nice mayor Christian Estrosi, who claimed Legay had fallen on her own and only suffered minor injuries.

"Yes, I know, its a shame, since I know that it wasnt in a clash with the police; she stumbled," Estrosi said. "Of course every person who is wounded today, whether in these circumstances or others  it's always unfortunate, but I think that those are superficial wounds."

According to Legay's daughter and follow-up reports, she suffered skull fractures, brain hemorrhaging, and five broken ribs in the melee and is recovering in hospital.

An airport in New York has rejected Chick-fil-A from an upcoming food court project, making it the second airport to ban the restaurant in as many weeks.

On Friday, Democratic New York State Assemblyman Sean Ryan applauded the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority (NFTA) for its decision to ban the restaurant from the Buffalo Niagara International Airport over so-called anti-LGBTQ practices.

Update: I applaud the decision that has been made to remove Chick-fil-A from plans for the Buffalo Niagara International Airport. Thank you to everyone who reached out to share their opinion. pic.twitter.com/HA5t1CjwkV  Assemblyman Sean Ryan (@SeanMRyan149) March 29, 2019

Earlier today I spoke with the vendor of the Buffalo Airport food court project, and they informed me they will not be opening a Chick-fil-A as a part of their airport project, Ryan wrote in a statement Friday. A publicly financed facility like the Buffalo Niagara International Airport is not the appropriate venue for a Chick-fil-A restaurant. I applaud the decision that has been made to remove Chick-fil-A from the plans for this project. We hope in the future the NFTA will make every effort to contract with businesses that adhere to antidiscriminatory policies, and were confident another vendor who better represents the values of the Western New York community will replace Chick-fil-A as a part of this project in the very near future.

The announcement comes one day after Ryan penned a statement criticizing the NFTAs move to allow Chick-fil-A, after last weeks decision by the San Antonio city council to ban the restaurant from its city airport.

I'm disappointed in the @NFTA decision to bring a Chick-fil-A to the @BUFAirport. pic.twitter.com/zP0oIUOz3q  Assemblyman Sean Ryan (@SeanMRyan149) March 29, 2019

I was disappointed to learn of the NFTAs decision to introduce Chick-fil-A as a restaurant option at the Buffalo-Niagara International Airport, Ryan wrote Thursday. Chick-fil-A has a long history of supporting and funding anti-LGBTQ organizations. In fact, the San Antonio City Council recently rejected a plan to open a Chick-fil-A at the San Antonio International Airport due to the companys discriminatory advocacy.

A statement from Chick-fil-A to the San Antonio city council last week disputed their misperceptions of the companys values, and invited them to visit any of its 32 San Antonio area restaurants.

On Thursday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton vowed to investigate the San Antonio city councils decision to ensure it does not violate discrimination laws or infringe on the religious rights of Texans.

The City of San Antonios decision to exclude Chick-fil-A based on the religious beliefs associated with the company and its owners is the opposite of tolerance. Its discriminatory, and not only out of step with Texas values, but inconsistent with the Constitution and Texas law. pic.twitter.com/iOk7G9Eltv  Ken Paxton (@KenPaxtonTX) March 28, 2019

The Constitutions protection of religious liberty is somehow even better than Chick-fil-As chicken, Paxton wrote in a letter to San Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg. Unfortunately, I have serious concerns that both are under assault at the San Antonio airport.

You should also note that I have directed my office to open an investigation into whether the Citys action violates state law, Paxton added. I trust the City will fully cooperate with my investigation into this matter, and will abide by relevant federal and state laws in the future.

Chick-fil-A did not respond to Infowars request for comment as of writing.

No law changed.

By presidential fiat, an accessory that was allowed throughout the George W. Bush & Obama administrations was just banned and John Roberts who claimed the Constitution permitted Obamacare, has just shut down a lawsuit to stop the dangerous precedent.

Amazon was pressured into removing baby jumpsuits with highly inappropriate sayings written on them after critics pointed out the clothing was aimed at pedophiles.

One of the garments reading Daddys Little F*** Toy was being sold for $18.98 (14.38) before being removed from Amazons website.

Another onesie with the phrase I Just Look Illegal was being sold for $20 (15.15) by third-party Canadian vendor VanBer.

Prof. Marci Hamilton, CEO of a non-profit committed to protecting children called CHILD USA, told The Sun, It is outrageous that baby clothing with this language appears anywhere on the web let alone Amazon.

I had assumed that Amazon had to clear products before they are put online. It clearly should have been ringing alarm bells  but it went online, she continued.

An Amazon spokesperson responded: All marketplace sellers must follow our selling guidelines, and those who dont will be subject to action including potential removal of their account. The product in question is no longer available.

Mindy Robinson joins Roger Stone and Owen Shroyer to expose online child predators, pedophiles and the growing acceptance of child abuse in our culture.

Meanwhile, conservative political voices are being shut out of the same social media outlets that allow child predators to thrive.

Colorados Senate passed the so-called red flag bill that allows law enforcement to seize peoples guns if a court rules them at risk to themselves or others.

Thursdays 18-17 vote, that saw no Republican support, moved the bill one step closer to Governor Jared Polis signature  who has already pledged to sign it into law if it reaches his desk.

The legislation, called House Bill 1177, has been slammed by the states sheriffs who have been supporting multiple counties efforts to become a Second Amendment sanctuary.

If you pass an unconstitutional law, our oaths as commissioners or myself as the sheriff  were going to follow our constitutional oath first, said Sheriff Steve Reams.

Advocates for the bill insist its intended to combat mental health issues as over half of Colorados suicides involve a firearm, a cause sheriffs are eager to address but not at the expense of everyones rights.

Its time we quit trying to put lipstick on a pig and start funding our mental health facilities, instead of trying to take the rights from our people, said another sheriff.

The states attorney general, Democrat Phil Weiser, has called officials to leave office if they cant follow the law.

If a sheriff cannot follow the law, the sheriff cannot do his or her job, Weiser said. The right thing to do for a sheriff who says, I cant follow the law is to resign.

Interestingly, after being pressed by the media, Governor Polis has distanced himself from Weisers remarks by saying police can exercise their discretion when choosing to honor the new law.

Every law enforcement agency has limited resources, and they do have to prioritize what they choose to enforce or not enforce, said Polis.



New York has declared a state of emergency by banning unvaccinated children from public spaces. Mike Adams joins Alex to break down this dystopian development.

An Austin American-Statesman investigation found an altercation between Alex Jones and customers at a Lucys Fried Chicken restaurant began when the customers approached Jones table as he sat dining.

Speaking to a Lucys employee, The Statesmans Jonathan Tilove discovered Jones was not responsible for initiating the confrontation which went viral over the weekend.

An employee with Lucys told the American-Statesman that Jones, a regular customer, was in the inside seating area of the eatery off South Congress Avenue when some other customers approached his table with insults, Tilove reported Thursday.

On Saturday, Jones and his wife were having oysters at Lucys when a group of leftists spotted and began berating him.

Jones initially ignored the insults, among which leftists shouted, Fuck you, fuck your family! and Eat shit Alex Jones, youre gonna get it, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!

Videos that emerged of the event begin with Jones holding his phone up to film a group of patrons as they chant protest slogans at him.

Jones maintained the footage did not show the full context and was deceptively edited.

They baited me like a matador does with a bull and then when I open the door, theyre all waiting with their cameras going and then edited it deceptively, because it didnt look right because showing them chanting obscenities at me would have ruined their narrative, Jones told Infowars.

Heres raw footage of the incident, corroborating Jones version of events.

Evolutionary roboticists have decided to begin teaching artificial intelligence powered robots to evolve and reproduce. Why should humans go to the trouble of building more robots when a robot could do it instead?

According to Futurism, this is known as high-tech Darwinism. The researchers ultimate goal is to design artificial intelligence and robots that can analyze their own source code and mate with others by combining bits and pieces of their code with that of other robots. This would to create offspring, much like organic life, Futurism reported. But it isnt actually anything like organic life, actually. But evolutionary roboticists who have this new goal have high-tech Darwinism to the extreme. Apparently, just like biological life evolves to fill ecological niches, these robots offspring might be better adapted to their environments that their architects specifically built them for.

An interesting future awaits once high-tech Darwinism becomes successful. And Wired reported that some scientists are well on their way to making this technology a reality.

Computer scientists at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam built a simplified system that shows how future robots might swap and combine their genetic information.

Their recent research, published in the journal Nature Machine Intelligence and which involved programming two parent robots to code a new offspring, found that the resulting offspring contain a mixture of the parents code as well as some modules that seemed to have mutated or been blended on its own. Futurism

David Howard, one of the scientists on the project, told Wired that theres a positive spin to all of this. It gives you a lot of diversity, and it gives you the power to explore areas of a design space that you wouldnt normally go into. But others see this as a way to permanently force human beings into extinction. One of the things that makes natural evolution powerful is the idea that it can really specialize a creature to an environment, Howard told Wired.

But natural evolution doesnt sound anything like robot evolution. Humans are making themselves obsolete and our two cents is that this will not end well for humanity.

Big Tech has gained power by absorbing personal data from its users. Brad Shear joins Alex to discuss the agenda of Big Tech and solutions for the future.

Infowars Life Survival Shield X-2 Is Available For You And Your Family!

Leading the charge in super high quality nascent iodine, the new Infowars Life Survival Shield X-2 will help boost your health beyond expectations. *



A Stronger Formula From 7,000 Feet Below The Surface



Derived from ancient sea salts found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface, the evolution of Survival Shield is here and much stronger than our original formula.* Every drop contains 650 micrograms to keep you in prime form.

Feel the relief and strength of the next step in proprietary nascent iodine, developed using our Thermodynamic Pressure Sensitive High Energy Sound Pulse Nano-Emulsion Technology that allows for a highly unique and powerful nascent iodine that is both concentrated, and free of unwanted additives and genetically modified ingredients to make sure that your organic nascent iodine supplements are the best for your body. During our quality control phase, we screen for any harmful additives - even up to radiation.*



The Top 5 Reasons You Need Nascent Iodine



Iodine is an essential mineral that supports thyroid health and well-being for the body. *

Nascent iodine may support healthy iodine levels to supercharge cognitive functions. *

Nascent iodine may support healthy hormone levels to stabilize your vitality. *

Nascent iodine may be involved in maintaining healthy metabolism to keep you going as long as necessary.* Supplementing with pure nascent iodine may help your body reach optimal iodine levels so you don't have to reach it from impure sources.*



Survival Shield X-2 Quality



Survival Shield X-2 is manufactured in a state-licensed facility that meets federal regulatory standards, is cGMP/HACCP-compliant, and lab grade. Raw elemental iodine is a controlled substance both at a State and Federal level, and Survival Shield X-2 meets all requirements in controlling it. The licensing, approvals and regulatory documentary procedures are exacting and costly, but worth it for our consumers.



Bound forms of iodine must first be separated, clarified and purified from other binding components or impurities into a USP-grade (United States Pharmaceutical), mono-elemental iodine as certified USP resublimated iodine crystals. In this purified crystal form, iodine is a highly reactive and toxic substance. However, when the purified USP iodine crystals are subjected to a proprietary process it becomes nano-colloidalized and transforms into a form of elemental nascent iodine, also referred to as monoatomic iodine, without the addition of iodides!



Shocking Statistics About Iodine



According to the World Health Organization's Department o f Nutrition for Health and Development, iodine deficiency is a public health problem in 54 countries where impure iodine sources are plentiful.

The CDC states that iodine deficiency is one of the four major deficiency diseases in the world (Thankfully, it is easily corrected).

The 2013 USGS iodine commodity summary warns that there are no comparable substitutes for iodine that will match it's benefits.

Information published by UNICEF notes that iodine deficiency is the most avoidable cause of stunted physical and intellectual development.

What Are The Health Benefits Of Nascent Iodine?



Proper iodine levels may provide support for normal response to environmental and dietary toxins to keep your body clean and moving.*

Supports thyroid health to regulate hormone production and vitality.*

May support breast milk production and quality for new mothers.*

Why Is Survival Shield X-2 The Best Nascent Iodine Available?



Survival Shield X-2 is created from ancient salt solutions found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface for maximum effect.



It is tested for radiation and other dangerous impurities by our quality control experts before being placed for sale.



It is approximately 50% stronger than our original Survival Shield formulation to bring about the greatest benefit.



It is a true glycerite of natural USP grade iodine.

The nascen t iodine in Survival Shield X-2 is not subjected to direct heat, harsh chemicals, or alcohol to keep the ingredients pure and organic.

The transformative process produces a stable product that no other brand can match, though many have tried!

Completely non-GMO certified for the most natural ingredients.

Vegan-friendly and completely non-toxic to make sure all of our supplements help create the best benefits.

It provides high elemental iodine uptake.

Contains NO inefficient iodides.

Does not sting or burn.

The European Union has reportedly offered April Fools Day 2020 as a new Brexit date should Theresa Mays deal fail to succeed on a mooted third attempt to get it through Parliament, assuming Remain MPs move to stop a No Deal on exit on April 12th.

Brexit was originally scheduled to take place on Friday, March 29th, with or without a deal, but the Prime Minister has now delayed it in concert with the European Council  despite promising she would not do so 108 times, and her own MPs and party National Convention voting against it  so it will either take place on May 22nd if her deal is approved by Parliament, or April 12th on No Deal terms if it is not.

It is widely expected that the Remainer-dominated House of Commons will not allow No Deal to take place on April 12th whatever happens to the deal, however, and reportsindicate that should they seek a long extension of the Article 50 negotiating period to find a new way forward  likely via a second referendum or a general election acting as a proxy for one  the EU will offer April Fools Day 2020 as the new deadline.

The situation in Parliament is developing rapidly, but at present it looks as though Mrs May will attempt to hold a thinly disguised third so-called meaningful vote on her deal tomorrow, as downhearted Brexiteers who have previously denounced it and even sacrificed ministerial positions to attack it say they will now back it, provided she resignsonce the deed is done.

Greek economist and former Finance Minister, Yanis Varoufakis, was not pulling any punches last night as he absolutely destroyed Theresa Mays bad EU deal.

Varoufakis, who has more experience dealing with the European Union than most, pointed out the soft UK approach taken during last nights Question Time.

He described a big flaw in the governments strategy as failing to recognise Michel Barnier, when he announced the two-phased negotiation process, was issuing a declaration of hostilities against the government which they never ever saw coming.

WATCH | @YanisVaroufakis tears May's deal to shreds: "Whether you're a Brexiteer or Remainer, this is a deal a nation signs only when it has been defeated in war. It's not a deal which is fit for purpose for any sovereign country." #BBCQT Support us at https://t.co/iICfFaQP1G pic.twitter.com/7w8zlsJkt3  Leave.EU (@LeaveEUOfficial) March 28, 2019

13 MEPs were tricked into voting for the European Union Copyright Directive when they initially planned to vote against it, a crucial error which led to the measure passing by just 5 votes, but the EU has refused to hold the vote again.

An extra vote was inserted into the voting list at the last minute which threw most MEPs voting lists out of sync, reports the Guido Fawkes blog. Unlike the Commons where MPs have to physically make the decision to walk through lobbies, MEPs just robotically press buttons according to a long voting list handed out to them. A clear warning of the dangers of electronic voting

Since the measure passed by a mere 5 votes, the 13 votes that went the wrong way were crucial to the outcome. If the MEPs had not been tricked, they would not have been blocked from voting on amendments to the bill, including the notorious Article 13.

However, despite complaints, the EU has refused to revisit the result of the vote or hold the vote again, merely agreeing to change the voting record of the individual MEPs.

Its appalling, but thats how this place works on a regular basis, said Brexit Party MEP Bill Etheridge . Its only come to peoples attention this time because its a high profile issue.

This is a shocking illustration of how the EU operates. The vote has basically been stolen and yet the European Parliament refuses to do anything about it.

Critics say Article 13 will force social media companies to introduce filters that will automatically block content uploaded by users. This would include transformative content, including memes that are widely considered fair use but would be blocked by the filter.

Such a system would also be completely open to abuse in terms of censoring free speech.

President Donald Trump is preparing to sign a series of executive orders soon that would quicken development on oil and gas pipelines in the Northeast, Axios reported Thursday night, citing sources familiar with the matter.

The orders could come within the next couple of weeks, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Wednesday during a meeting with conservative group Council for Capital Formation, the report notes. Trump made supporting oil pipelines an important part of his administration and has already signed orders approving past projects.



America has become an oil producing powerhouse under President Trump, however globalists and the left are united in their anti-American stance on energy.

Trump signed two executive orders in 2017 ordering his administration to move forward on the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) and Keystone XL Pipeline, both of which extend more than a thousand miles and carry multi-billion dollar price tags.

DAPL is the only one of these two projects to be completed. The nearly $8 billion Keystone extension, which is intended to be a bridge between the U.S. and Canada, is currently held up in court, and further delays could prevent TransCanada from finishing pre-construction work. TransCanada asked a federal judge in 2018 to allow pre-construction activities to be completed while government conducts further reviews.

Activists railed against Trumps decision at the time. They fought for years to block Keystone XL Pipeline calling it a threat to the environment and the climate, though, even the Obama State Departments analysis discounted these arguments. The State Department approved a permit for the pipeline less than two months after the president signed the orders. Keystone would carry 800,000 barrels of oil per day. The White House did not provide a comment to The Daily Caller News Foundation.

Money supply growth slowed in February, falling to the lowest rate recorded since February of last year.

Overall, money-supply growth remains well below the growth rates experienced from 2009 to 2016, and has fluctuated little since March of last year

In February, year-over-year growth in the money supply was at 3.1 percent. That was down from Januarys growth rate of 3.3 percent, but was up from February 2018s rate of 3.0 percent.

The money-supply metric used here  the true or Rothbard-Salerno money supply measure (TMS)  is the metric developed by Murray Rothbard and Joseph Salerno, and is designed to provide a better measure of money supply fluctuations than M2. The Mises Institute now offers regular updates on this metric and its growth.

This measure of the money supply differs from M2 in that it includes treasury deposits at the Fed (and excludes short-time deposits, travelers checks, and retail money funds).

M2 growth fell in February, growing 4.2 percent, compared to Januarys growth rate of 4.3 percent. M2 grew 4.1 percent in February of last year. Like the TMS measure, the M2 growth rate has fallen considerably since late 2016, but has varied little in recent months.

Money supply growth can often be a helpful measure of economic activity. During periods of economic boom, money supply tends to grow quickly as banks make more loans. Recessions, on the other hand, tend to be preceded by periods of falling money-supply growth.

Many factors contribute to these trends. In recent months, money supply growth  in both M2 and TMS  has likely been impacted by falling growth rates in real estate loans at commercial banks. In February, real estate loans grew 2.9 percent, year over year, which was a 51-month low. The demand for mortgage loans has softened as mortgage rates have risen. In February, the 30-year, fixed average mortgage rate reached 4.4 percent, which was down from Novembers recent high of 4.87. February 2018s average mortgage rate was much lower, however, coming in at 4.33 percent. However, the Fed has recently signaled it plans to half increases in the target rate, and this may lead to more real-estate loan activity.

During its FOMC meeting last week, the Federal Reserve took 2019 rate cuts completely off the table. It said it will freeze bond sales from its $3.8 trillion balance sheet later this autumn. In other words, balance sheet normalization is pretty much a done deal.

Peter Schiff has predicted this would happen. He said from the beginning if and when the Fed tried to normalize rate, it would have to abort the process.

And here we are.

But as Peter explained in his most recent podcast, the Fed still isnt being honest about why its done a monetary policy 180. Its making excuses.

As I predicted, they are not telling the truth. The markets cant handle that. The Fed is not telling the markets, Were not raising rates because the economy is imploding because of all the debt that was accumulated when we kept rates so low. Now we cant raise them. Or we cant continue to shrink the balance sheet because the budget deficits are blowing out of control.

Indeed, the federal government spent itself into an all-time record deficit in February. Think about that. That means the government is running bigger deficits than it was during the Great Recession.

If we are running these enormous budget deficits now  before the recession  imagine how much greater theyre going to be during the recession. The Fed cant add fuel to the fire by competing with the Treasury. The Fed cant keep unloading bonds at the same time that the Treasury is selling them like theyre going out of style.

Peter said he thinks that by the time Trump leaves office, he will have set deficit records for every single month in the calendar year. He said the only good news  at least for Republicans politically  is that the next president will have to run even higher deficits.

Which is why were going to have a sovereign debt crisis and a currency crisis.

Given the enormity of these deficits and the ever-upward spiraling debt, the Fed has no choice but to call off the tightening. You cant raise interest rates in an economy built on piles of debt. But the Fed cant tell the markets that. They will have to figure it out on their own. So far, they seem pretty clueless. But eventually, they will and thats when the bottom is really going to fall out of the dollar.

When the Fed has to go back to zero, which it will be doing relatively soon, when the Fed has to go back to quantitative easing, nobody is going to believe that it is temporary again. Nobody is going to buy the Feds BS about how interest rates are going to stay low only temporarily and then were going to normalize them, and were going to shrink our balance sheet. Were not monetizing the debt. After the recession is over were going to shrink our balance sheet back down to where it was before the recession. No ones going to believe that. They couldnt shrink a $4 trillion balance sheet. They wont be able to shrink an $8 trillion balance sheet. If they couldnt raise rates when the national debt was $22 trillion, they sure as hell cant raise them when the national debt is $30 trillion.

But at this point, the markets havent figured this out. Peter said they dont really want to.

They dont want to admit I was right from the beginning  that the Fed checked us into a monetary roach motel and theres no way to ever check out. But I do believe the markets are going to figure this out, whether the Fed admits it or not  during the next recession.

Peter pointed out the inverted yield curve, widely seen as a warning sign for a recession. But he pointed out that the spread between 10-year Treasurys and 30-year Treasurys remains positive and is even widening. He goes on to explain why this next recession is actually going to feature stagflation. He also covers some of the recent economic data and touches on the Mueller report.



Officials in Rockland County, NY declared a countywide state of emergency Tuesday as medical martial law has made its debut by banning unvaccinated children from public spaces. Mike Adams joins Alex to break down this dystopian development.

An elderly French woman who suffered skull fractures and brain hemorrhaging when riot police stormed a crowd at 'Yellow Vest' demonstrations was scolded and discredited by President Macron and the mayor of Nice, according to reports.

Genevieve Legay, 73, who has been described as an anti-capitalist activist, was reportedly waving a rainbow-colored "flag of peace" when police in riot gear and shields charged into a group of protestors, seeming to knock her violently to the pavement.

Video footage of the fray shows Legay lying apparently unconscious on the ground, blood pouring from her face as officers surround her and one checks her vital signs.

When asked to comment on the episode during an interview with Nice-Matin, French president Emmanuel Macron responded, "I wish her a quick recovery, and I also wish her more wisdom. A fragile person, who is at risk of being pushed down, shouldnt go to unauthorized marches or put themselves in such a situation."

French television hosts later analyzed "information distortion" about the incident delivered to reporters by Nice mayor Christian Estrosi, who claimed Legay had fallen on her own and only suffered minor injuries.

"Yes, I know, its a shame, since I know that it wasnt in a clash with the police; she stumbled," Estrosi said. "Of course every person who is wounded today, whether in these circumstances or others  it's always unfortunate, but I think that those are superficial wounds."

According to Legay's daughter and follow-up reports, she suffered skull fractures, brain hemorrhaging, and five broken ribs in the melee and is recovering in hospital.

The raid is the latest effort by German authorities to clamp down on Middle Eastern crime families in large cities.

Authorities searched more than a dozen establishments in the neighborhoods of Neuklln and Moabit.

Police in Berlin carried out one of their largest crime raids ever on Wednesday against organized crime in the German capital.

Authorities said the raids were hoping to clamp down on what they described to be "criminal parallel societies," which are predominantly of Arab or Eastern European descent.

Europe appears lost as reports emerge that German police are actually covering up migrant crimes to push the narrative that migrants are never violent or break the law and should be welcomed with open arms.

The raid comes in the wake of similar crackdowns that took place in Germany's most populous state of North Rhine Westphalia. Police are trying to address a problem that affects the country's urban hubs where so-called clans; large criminal families, are suspected of involvement in drug trafficking, forced prostitution and other illegal activity.

Over 300 agents participated in the Berlin raid, which lasted several hours and took place in the neighborhoods of Moabit and Neuklln.

Local authorities were also on the scene, lead by State Interior Minister Andreas Geisel and borough mayor Martin Hikel, both of whom are part of the Social Democratic party (SPD).

Some 10 jewelry stores and travel agencies were inspected for tax irregularities, and authorities reported 17 violations, daily Berliner Zeitung reported.

In one of the travel agencies, police confiscated thousands of euros on suspicion of money laundering.

Six shisha bars and three pubs were also searched, where violations for tax fraud and illegal sale of water pipe tobacco were registered. Authorities closed one of the shisha bars for multiple violations, including the discovery of drugs at the scene which lead to a 29-year-old man's arrest.

State Interior Minister Geisel thanked the police for their efforts, who in turn lauded the cooperation that public officials had provided in the common fight against the clans. But Geisel warned that more work lies ahead, as criminal structures cannot not be broken up overnight.

Not everyone in the city was celebrating. According to Berliner Zeitung, spokesman for the Liberal party's (FDP) parliamentary group in Berlin's House of Representatives, Marcel Luthe, criticized the raid as a public relations move.

"Instead of targeting the source of money," Luthe said, Geisel "was again organizing dubious public relations events at a great public expense."

"The police are not a public relations tool," he added, saying that the raid was diverting resources from actual policing in nearby crime-ridden areas.

French police officers were injured when their vehicle was attacked by a gang shooting fireworks at close range, according to local media.

The patrol was passing through a neighborhood in Yvelines when it was ambushed by approximately six suspects.

Video of the siege was shared to social media, indicating it may have been premeditated, Actu17 reports.

"The neighborhood was quiet when around 22:20, a municipal police car that passed Place des Violettes and rue des Frres Tissier in Carrires-sous-Poissy, was the target of fireworks fire by half a dozen individuals. One of the attackers suddenly approached the vehicle to use his mortar against the police."

The driver of the vehicle can be seen losing control and nearly crashing into parked cars at the onset of the siege before speeding off as the assailants give chase.

Two officers reportedly sustained burns to the head and arms after at least one of the explosives entered the vehicle, and all three officers involved are suffering from tinnitus.

Additional patrols were deployed to the neighborhood, but none of the suspects could be located and no arrests were made.

Several Swedish organisations have blown the whistle on underage migrants allegedly being used by their older caretakers in exchange for food and a place to stay.

Gothenburg-based volunteer organisation Agape has identified at least 20 cases, where the care of unaccompanied underage migrants has turned into a full-fledged sexual relationship, with young people being used for sexual services.

Agape's Matilda Brinck-Larsen explained to the local newspaper Gteborgs-Posten that the newcomers receive food and shelter in exchange for their sexual services. Others had to perform unpaid work.

The number of unreported cases is much greater, she ventured, as it it hard for youngsters to reveal what they have been going through.

Paul Joseph Watson breaks down how the European Union has officially voted to adopt the Article 13 provision into law which would govern the production and distribution of online content under the presumption of copyright protections, but what this really means is no more creative memes.

Sara Edvardson Ehernborg of the activist network Vi str inte ut ("We can't stand it") confirmed a number of cases where migrants end up in sexual relations in exchange for help.

"Women have used them to get pregnant. Some have even given birth", Edvardson Ehernborg pointed out.

The Salvation Army's Gothenburg-based accommodation Lilla Bommen also confirmed that migrants get abused by older people.

It's more common than you think, deputy head of operations Ingela Sagman admitted.

"It may have started when they had nightmares and had to sleep beside their foster mother  or father, Brinck-Larsen explained.

Brinck-Larsen also ventured that how foster families communicate with migrants is problematic. The use of affectionate words and diminutives not only belittles migrants, but adds ambiguity, she suggested.
