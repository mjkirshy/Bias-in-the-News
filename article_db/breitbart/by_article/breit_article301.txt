GOP Sen. Hawley: Media Face a ‘Major Crisis a Crisis of Confidence, Which They Deserve’
Friday on Hugh Hewitt’s nationally syndicated radio show, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) said he foresees problems ahead for the media in the wake of the conclusion of the special counsel Robert Mueller’s findings that the 2016 Trump campaign did not collude with the Russian government to defeat Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.

Hawley described the situation as the media having been “shown up to the greatest extent” of his lifetime.

“I do think that you’ve seen a massive sea change here. I mean, they, and nobody, Hugh, you talk about the resistance,” he said. “Of course, it’s not just elected Democrats. I mean, the resistance has its real home in the liberal media. And the media has been shown up to the greatest extent in my lifetime. I’m 39 years old this year. I mean, to the greatest extent of my lifetime, they have been shown to be horrifically partisan, to have perpetrated and perpetuated a series of falsehoods, and in many cases, to have done it knowingly all because they hate this president. They disagree with him politically, and they’d do anything to take him down.”

“And so I think they’re going to face a major crisis of confidence, which they deserve,” Hawley continued. “And the Democrat Party is facing a major crisis of identity now, and policy, which they deserve. And it’s incumbent on us, and the President, by the way, said this when he visited the Republican senators this past week. He said now it’s our time to push forward, to continue to push forward, and to lead this country, to show the American people what we’re for. He’s exactly right. And that’s why I’m extremely optimistic about the next two years, and the next four after that.”
