NAACP celebrates 50th Image Awards honoring celebs of color
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Donald Glover, Beyonce and “Black Panther” will be honored and vie for awards at Saturday’s 50th NAACP Image Awards.

Anthony Anderson returns as host of the show devoted to works by entertainers and writers of color at the Dolby Theatre, the same venue where that hosts the Academy Awards. The ceremony airs live on TV One.

Glover, who won four Grammys this year, is nominated for his acting and directing on “Atlanta,” which is up for best comedy series. On the music side, his alter-ego Childish Gambino is nominated for top male performer and his song “This is America” is nominated for best video and song.

“Black Panther” is nominated for 14 awards including best motion picture along with “BlacKkKlansman,” ”Crazy Rich Asians,” ”If Beale Street Could Talk” and “The Hate U Give.”

Jussie Smollett is nominated for outstanding supporting actor in a drama series for his role in “Empire,” but his representative says he’s not planning to attend.

It’s been a tumultuous week for the actor-singer after a felony case against him was dropped in Chicago. The handling of the case, which accused Smollett of falsely reporting to police that he was assaulted by two men in downtown Chicago early Jan. 29, has drawn widespread condemnation.

Beyonce, LeBron James, Regina King, Chadwick Boseman and Ryan Coogler are nominated for entertainer of the year.

U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters will receive the NAACP Chairman’s Award for public service.
