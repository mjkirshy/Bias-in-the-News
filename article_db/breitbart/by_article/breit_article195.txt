WATCH: Tiger Woods’ Caddie Angrily Snatches the Hat off a Patron During Shot
When you caddie for Tiger Woods, your visibility is higher than what it might be for most other golfers. It also means, apparently, that you have to lay down the law.

Such an instance was caught on video Friday, as Tiger Woods’ caddie Joe LaCava angrily snatched a hat off a patron while Woods was taking a swing.

Watch:

Some on Twitter have speculated that LaCava’s reaction was due to the patron merely taking pictures during the shot. However, the fan is only one of at least a dozen people taking pictures. Instead, it’s more likely that the man did not mute the camera on his phone.

The fan raises his hand and immediately acknowledged his error.

So, let it be known to all: do not talk, take unmuted pictures, or do anything to draw attention to yourself while Tiger Woods is taking a swing. Otherwise, you’ll have to deal with Joe.
