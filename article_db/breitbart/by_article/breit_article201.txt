Bryce Harper Tops Aaron Judge in Jersey Sales
Philadelphia Phillies outfielder Bryce Harper has the most popular jersey in Major League Baseball, according to online sales details revealed Thursday by the league.

Harper signed a 13-year, $330 million contract with the Phillies on March 2 after spending his first seven seasons with the Washington Nationals.

His number three shirt with the Phillies set North American professional sports records for most jerseys sold in the first 24 and 48 hours after joining a new team, according to Fanatics online shops.

Harper was followed by fellow All-Star outfielder Aaron Judge of the New York Yankees, whose jersey sales had led the major leagues in each of the past two seasons.

Mookie Betts, reigning American League Most Valuable Player for the World Series champion Boston Red Sox, ranks third with seven-time All-Star Mike Trout of the Los Angeles Angels and nine-time All-Star catcher Yadier Molina of the St. Louis Cardinals rounding out the top five.

Seattleâ€™s Ichiro Suzuki, who retired after the Mariners opened the season with two games in Japan to start the season, ranked 13th on the sales list.
