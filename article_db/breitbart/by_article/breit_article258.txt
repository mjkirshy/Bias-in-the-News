Two Gunmen Kill at Least Six in Brazil School Shooting
At least six people were killed during a Brazil school shooting Wednesday when two gunmen opened fire.

The school was located in Suzano, a São Paulo suburb.

Thomas Reuters Foundation News reports that five of the dead were children and the sixth was an adult.

The two gunmen, who were reportedly adolescents, are also dead. KARE 11 reports that the two gunmen “killed themselves” after opening fire on others.

BBC reports that the gunmen “hooded themselves” before attacking, leaving a number of wounded in addition to fatalities.

The University of Sydney’s GunPolicy.org labels Brazil’s overarching gun control policy as “restrictive.” Brazil requires residents to obtain a license before they may “acquire, possess or transfer a firearm or ammunition,” and such residents must show good cause for obtaining the license before it will be issued.

Moreover, the minimum age for obtaining a license is 25 and the process for securing a license entails “a background check which considers criminal, mental health and employment records.” Third party character references are also part of the process of acquiring a license to own a gun.
