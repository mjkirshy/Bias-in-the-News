VIDEO: Reporter Hires Gloria Allred After Boxer Kisses Her During Interview
Reporter Jenny Sushe has hired attorney Gloria Allred after Bulgarian boxer Kubrat Pulev delivered an unsolicited kiss during an interview.

Sushe was interviewing the Bulgarian heavyweight, but when she began to wrap up her few minutes with him, Pulev suddenly grabbed the reporter by the face and planted a kiss on her lips before walking away.

Pulev later blew off the controversy saying that he is friendly with Sushe and the quick kiss was no big deal, according to TMZ.

“On the video, after our kiss, we both laughed about it and thanked each other,” Pulev said. “There really is nothing more to this.”

It is true that the two laughed after the kiss but before the video cuts, Sushe appeared non plussed by the encounter and is heard saying “Jesus Christ.”

Now, it appears that her discomfort with the kiss has grown enough that she is seeking council.
