WATCH: Tiger Woods Makes Incredible 82-Yard Shot for Eagle at WGC-Match Play
The winner at this week’s WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play tournament is yet to be determined. However, the early prize for the most clutch, odds-defying shots clearly goes to Tiger Woods.

Fresh off an amazing left-handed shot on a ball that was under a bush during Thursday’s action, Tiger continued the theatrics on Friday afternoon by sinking an 82-yard wedge shot on the par-4 13th for an eagle 2.

Watch:

The shot put Woods up two on Patrick Cantlay.

According to Sports Illustrated, “Woods, who is making his final start before the Masters. entered the day needing to beat Cantlay and have Aaron Wise beat Brandt Snedeker to advance to the knockout round portion of this tournament. He appears on his way to holding up his end of the bargain.”

He does indeed.
