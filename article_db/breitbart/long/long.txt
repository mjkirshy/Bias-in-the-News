The ongoing border crisis forced Border Patrol officials to implement a massive catch and release program where most migrants illegally crossing the border are released shortly after being processed. The policy comes as Border Patrol officials estimate that more than 100,000 migrants will be apprehended in March.

Border Patrol officials in multiple sectors announced a policy this week to being releasing thousands of migrants on their own recognizance shortly after they are apprehended at the border. The move comes in response to the massive increase of illegal border crossings by migrant families from Central America.

“This demographic is challenging in that they cannot be immediately returned to their country of origin,” Del Rio Sector Border Patrol officials stated. “U.S. Border Patrol processing centers are not designed to house the current numbers of families and small children that we are encountering.”

During a press conference late this week, Yuma Sector Deputy Chief Patrol Agent Carl Landrum announced a similar policy for his Arizona sector. He blamed the dramatic surge in migrant families and minors that are overwhelming his sector’s agents and resources.

“Due to capacity issues at our stations and the ongoing humanitarian crisis nationwide, Border Patrol has begun identifying detainees for potential release in Yuma with a notice to appear for their immigration hearings,” Yuma Sector officials said in a written statement.

Landrum said his sector is on pace to apprehend 60,000 migrants this fiscal year. He explained that this is the highest level since 2007 when constructions crews built border barriers that greatly reduced illegal border crossings in the Yuma Sector, AZCentral reported. The deputy chief said his sector has the capacity to hold about 400 migrants at a time.

The migrants being released reportedly have family members living in the U.S. and have cleared medical screening and criminal background checks, officials reported.

The same policy has also been implemented in the Rio Grande Valley Sector in South Texas where the largest number of migrant families and minors cross on a daily basis. Earlier this week, agents in this sector apprehended nearly 1,700 migrants in a single day, Breitbart News reported.

Hidalgo County, Texas, Sheriff Eddie Guerra says human smugglers are exploiting the current laws and advertising with pamphlets in Central America. “In Central American countries they have pamphlets and flyers that tell them, ‘Just Come to America! You will be processed and released, given an opportunity!” the sheriff said in an interview with KGBT.

During a speech at the Texas-Mexico border near El Paso, U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin K. McAleenan said, “On Monday, we saw the highest total of apprehensions and encounters in over a decade, with 4,000 migrants either apprehended or encountered at Ports of Entry in a single day. That was Monday.”

“Yesterday, we broke the record again with 4,117,” the commissioner stated. “We are now on pace for over 100 thousand apprehensions and encounters with migrants in March, with 90 percent of those, 90 thousand people, crossing the border illegally between Ports of Entry. March will be the highest month since 2008. The arriving flows are made up primarily of Central American families and unaccompanied children.”

“We have lost the ability to know who or what is coming across the border,” Border Patrol Agent Hector Garza told Fox & Friends during an interview on Thursday morning. The agent spoke to Fox News in his capacity as Vice President of the National Border Patrol Council.

“We don’t know who or what is coming across because now our agents are having to process these people, transport them, feed them, care for them, and now we can’t even do our job of border security,” the veteran Border Patrol agent stated. “That’s unacceptable.”

“Out of those 100,000 that are going to be coming in during the month of March, 90 percent are being released into the community.”

In an interview with Conservative Review, National Border Patrol Council President Brandon Judd said, “We have never seen what we are dealing with today. It’s unprecedented and we’re in uncharted waters.


A caravan migrant from Honduras who complained about being given beans to eat during her journey through Mexico is now in a Texas jail facing one charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. The woman became the topic of a viral video during her journey. The woman’s sister is also facing similar charges and both have an immigration detainer placed on them preventing them from bonding out.

Jail records from Dallas County jail revealed that Mirian Zelaya and Mirna Zelaya are both being held in a detention center on a charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. While jail records do not reveal the details that led to the charge, the news outlet Mundo Hispanico revealed that the two women allegedly beat another woman who was providing them with housing.

Mirian or Miriam Zelaya is a member of the much-publicized migrant caravan that traveled from Central America to the U.S. border. She became a viral sensation in Mexico in 2018 after she was interviewed at a migrant shelter in Tijuana on TV by the German network DW. During the interview, she complained about being given a plate of beans for food. The woman said she and her daughter were tired from the journey and had been given pig food or “comida de chanchos.”

The video of the interview rapidly turned viral in Mexico, earning Zelaya the nickname #LadyFrijoles or Lady Beans. The backlash by caravan protesters rapidly spread throughout Mexico leading to news outlets finding her again. Zelaya issued a public apology for her comments. Soon after Zelaya entered the U.S and moved to Dallas where her sister Mirna was already living.

Saturday on MSNBC’s “AM Joy,” former Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson acknowledged the severity of the crisis on the U.S.-Mexico border with regards to illegal immigration.

Johnson argued against sending unaccompanied minors back to without due process, but added that what was underway now was much worse than anything he dealt with as Obama’s Homeland Security secretary.

“The number you’re showing — I lived with them month by month, day by day,” Johnson said. “We had a crisis in 2014. It’s nowhere near the numbers you’re seeing now. There are ways to respond to this. One thing I would not do, which is [what] the secretary’s letter to Congress proposes is amending a law called the [Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA)] in a way to make it easier and faster to send unaccompanied kids back to Central America. We might be at the doorstep of another separating families at the border crisis, Joy.”

“The idea of sending a 7-year-old back to Central America without due process is something that most Americans should have a serious objection to,” he continued. “There are other ways to deal with this situation right now. As Kevin McAleenan, the commissioner of [Customs and Border Protection (CBP)], pointed out, on Tuesday, there were 4,000 apprehensions — one day alone, 4,000. We are on pace this month for 100,000 apprehensions. The highest we saw on my watch was May 2014, 65,000. So this is a crisis. It is very definitely a crisis. There are ways to deal with this. There are answers. There are no easy answers. The one thing we should not do as Americans is simply send a 7-year-old, an 8-year-old unaccompanied child back to Central America without due process.”

A CBS News poll shows that only 37 percent of Americans believe special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into the Russia collusion hoax was justified, while a majority of 54 percent believe it was “politically motivated.”

In a country as divided as this one, 54 percent of Americans agreeing on anything political is pretty impressive, and as Townhall points out, there has been a massive sea change in public perception of the Mueller investigation.

Just a couple of months ago, in January 2019, this same poll showed that only 45 percent believed the investigation was “politically motivated,” while 50 percent said it was “justified.”

In other words, those who believe the investigation was “justified” plummeted by 13 points, while those who believe it was “politically motivated” jumped nine points.

That’s a 22-point stampede in the other direction.

Naturally, the far-left CBS News, which, along with the rest of the establishment media, spent two years spreading the hoax about President Trump’s colluding with the Russians to steal the 2016 presidential election, buried these inconvenient findings below the numbers that push their agenda about the public wanting to see the Mueller Report — you know, as though that isn’t already going to happen.

Other numbers inconvenient to the fake media include the fact that only 38 percent of Americans want the investigations into Russia to continue by Democrats in Congress.

Only ten percent believe the Mueller investigation, which cleared the president entirely, was conducted unfairly.

Only 23 percent claim the investigation did not clear Trump, while 34 percent believe it has, and 36 percent believe it is too soon to say.

The CBS poll lines up pretty well with a recent Rasmussen poll that shows 61 percent of respondents want all congressional investigations against Trump to stop.

Whether Democrats and their allies in the fake news media want to acknowledge it or not, there was a pre-Mueller Report world and a post-Mueller Report world, and in this post-Mueller Report world, Trump is a duly elected president, a legitimate president, and one who was unfairly hounded, smeared, and harassed for two long years by a politically motivated/media-driven witch hunt.

With the 2020 presidential campaign about a year away from launching in earnest, Trump’s enemies would be wise to remember Bill Clinton’s 60 percent approval ratings during the Monica Lewinsky scandal.

Whatever you might think of Clinton as a man or president, he continued the Reagan-Bush era of peace and prosperity, and voters did not want that impeded over a personal indiscretion, even if it involved perjury.

Trump’s record is even more impressive, for he has delivered America into the first era of peace and prosperity in 17 long years, since September 11, 2001, and voters are not going to stand for any more of these hoaxes and fishing expeditions.

Two years of this nonsense are enough.

Prime Minister Theresa May has yet to give up on her thrice-defeated Withdrawal Agreement with the European Union, according to reports, and is attempting to organise a fourth parliamentary vote on it next week.

The Withdrawal Agreement was crushed by a record 230 votes when it was put to a so-called “meaningful vote” in the House of Commons in January, and by an only marginally less devastating 149 votes on a second attempt some weeks later.

The most recent vote on the Withdrawal Agreement, this time without its accompanying Political Declaration and therefore technically not another “meaningful vote”, according to the relevant parliamentary arcana, took place on March 29th — the date when Mrs May had promised 108 times that Britain would finally leave the European Union.

If the deal had passed, a Brexit on the terms it laid out should have taken place on May 22nd — but it was defeated yet again, by 58 votes.

In normal circumstances, this would be considered a heavy, possibly resignation-worthy defeat for a sitting Government, but in the current climate it is being interpreted almost in a positive light, with a Downing Street spokesman noting optimistically: “We are at least going in the right direction.”

Prior to the 2017 snap election which followed the 2016 referendum on Brexit, the Prime Minister pledged that “no deal is better than a bad deal” and, legally, the United Kingdom has now defaulted to a clean break with the EU on No Deal terms on April 12th, per the terms of the short deadline extension she was granted by the European Council.

However, while over 80 percent of MPs were elected on Brexit manifestos, the vast majority of them are former Remainers, and they have expressed their opposition to a No Deal exit in any circumstances.

It is therefore expected that Mrs May will try to secure a much longer Brexit delay at an emergency summit of the European Council on April 10th if Meaningful Vote 4, or MV4, is a non-starter — with reports indicating she will seek to put Brexit off by nine months.

Some members of the Cabinet are urging Mrs May to come back to “no deal is better than a bad deal” and embrace a clean exit on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms.

“The Remainers clearly want a customs union as an alternative but there isn’t a majority for that in the party — it would destroy the [Tory] party,” one ministerial source told The Telegraph.

“We would end up with a Ramsay MacDonald-esque government where we would be completely at odds with our own party,” referring to the first-ever Labour prime minister — who ultimately ended up having to govern with on behalf of the Tories, after losing the support of his own backbenchers.

“It’s time to be bold, we need to embrace No Deal.”

Govt Whistleblower: UK Prepared for ‘No Deal’ Brexit, Scare Stories ‘Absolutely Untrue’ https://t.co/FHVSSJBnua — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 29, 2018

Historians and constitutional experts have noted that Mrs May could stop MPs from preventing No Deal by calling on Queen Elizabeth II to prorogue — i.e. temporarily suspend — the parliamentary session, and simply waiting for No Deal to take effect as scheduled per the terms of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.

This would require a perhaps unlikely degree of resolve on the part of the Tory leader, however, almost certainly requiring her to remove a number of Cabinet ministers — most of whom are, like herself, former Remain campaigners — and precipitating her removal from office once Parliament reconvened.

On the other hand, her political fate appears to be sealed anyway, so she would not be incurring any cost she is not set to pay to pay already.

Brexit campaign leader Nigel Farage has told Breitbart London’s James Delingpole that he is ready to keep fighting for Brexit, and despite the ongoing betrayal of the 2016 vote by the British political establishment he remains upbeat.

Comparing Brexit — the political and constitutional revolution required to untangle the United Kingdom from 40 years of integration with the increasingly centralised and autocratic European Union — to some of the other great political upheavals in British history, Mr Farage said he was ready to fight the next election.

PICS: Farage Tells Brexit Betrayal Protest ‘We Will Get Our Country Back, We Are Going to Win!’ https://t.co/HPiUgNxco7 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 29, 2019

With an even deeper Brexit betrayal looming, which is likely to see the nation kept in the European Union for months or years into the future, it is becoming more and more likely that Britain will be forced to contest the European Parliament elections in May.

Despite the disappointment of the March 29th Brexit day being cancelled by the Government even though the date was guaranteed by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons 108 times, Mr Farage said he was upbeat and ready to keep fighting.

He told Breitbart London’s James Delingpole at the Leave Means Leave pro-Brexit rally in Westminster that, “Nobody in this country has spent more time, given more effort energy and love to this cause, of us becoming an independent United Kingdom. I should be the most depressed person here, and yet I’m not. I’m ready to fight again.

“We’ve been betrayed by much of Parliament, a duplicitous Prime Minister.”

Mr Farage also likened Brexit to some of the great political battles of the 19th century, including the Great Reform Act of 1832, which abolished many rotten boroughs and extended the right to vote to more of the adult population, and the abolition of slavery.

Both were enormously controversial, long and difficult political processes which nevertheless eventually succeeded and fundamentally changed the British political and social landscape.

Former Nevada Assemblywoman Lucy Flores was not just a victim of Joe Biden, but of a complicit media who deliberately looked the other way for decades.

Serial Young Girl-Toucher (nickname stolen from Ace of Spades) Joe Biden denies the incident with Flores, but the whole world knows he has been caught countless times on video and in photographs behaving inappropriately not only with women, but with young girls — very young girls.

But because Biden is a Democrat, and most especially because he was vice president to Barack “The Precious” Obama, not only has he been allowed to continue his serial young girl-touching rampage, the media have actually encouraged this behavior. Here’s the tip of that iceberg:

NBC News: “Photo of famously friendly Biden goes viral”

Politico: “Joe Biden: Sex symbol?”

U.S. News: “Here’s Joe Biden Being Joe Biden With Ash Carter’s Wife”

CNN: Biden’s ‘Shoulder Squeeze’ Lights Up Internet

BuzzFeed: “Joe Biden Got A Little Handsy With The New Defense Secretary’s Wife – We’ve reached peak Biden.”

In fact, the cover-up of Biden’s behavior was so important to the media that New York Times reporter Nicole Perlroth called on Twitter to censor images of Biden’s numerous #MeToo moments.

“In the past 24 hours, a new alt-right fake news meme had emerged of Biden as predator. How will @twitter handle?” she screeched. And as proof of this alt-right conspiracy, Perlroth linked Richard Armande Mills, who was using images and video of Biden culled from a notoriously racist outlet known as C-SPAN.

The dirty little secret is that for decades the media’s reaction to Biden’s #MeToo-ery was this…

Har, har, har! How quaint! How cute! Joe being Joe and we love Uncle Joe because Democrat.

If you can keep your head from exploding, try to imagine the media’s reaction if Vice President Mike Pence did … this.

But the media were so desperate to protect the Obama administration, outlets like CNN and BuzzFeed didn’t just ignore all of this inappropriate behavior; they encouraged it, excused it, laughed it off, pretended it was charming, all part of awesome Joe’s swingin’ mythology.

And this is why Lucy Flores wasn’t protected — because in 2014, when, Flores alleged, Biden touched her inappropriately, she lived in a world created by the corporate media where it was not only okay for Biden to touch women; it actually boosted his cool factor.

Lucy Flores wasn’t protected because not one person in the media, not even one female person, had the moral courage to break from the herd, to say, “This isn’t right.”

Lucy Flores in her own words:

I was taking deep breaths and preparing myself to make my case to the crowd, I felt two hands on my shoulders. I froze. “Why is the vice-president of the United States touching me?” I felt him get closer to me from behind. He leaned further in and inhaled my hair. I was mortified. I thought to myself, “I didn’t wash my hair today and the vice-president of the United States is smelling it. And also, what in the actual fuck? Why is the vice-president of the United States smelling my hair?” He proceeded to plant a big slow kiss on the back of my head. My brain couldn’t process what was happening. I was embarrassed. I was shocked. I was confused. There is a Spanish saying, “tragame tierra,” it means, “earth, swallow me whole.” I couldn’t move and I couldn’t say anything. I wanted nothing more than to get Biden away from me. My name was called and I was never happier to get on stage in front of an audience.

Again, Biden denies this happened.

No one is comparing Joe Biden to Harvey Weinstein, but as you will see in the links and video below, Biden has a real problem. And if what she claims happened did indeed happen, I don’t blame Flores at all for being mortified. That’s not an overreaction on her part. If someone did that to my wife, he’d wake up on his ass.

And yes, it is an abuse of power on Biden’s part. If he were a stagehand or a lighting guy or a reporter at the Flores event, he never would have done such a thing, but because he was a vice president protected by the complicit media…

And here’s the saddest truth of all…

It would have been breathtakingly easy for the media to get Biden to stop this behavior — behavior you know they all talked about and tsk’d-tsk’d behind the scenes. One little news cycle would have saved heaven knows how many women from Uncle Joe’s Creepy Young Girl-Touching, but partisanship reigned, the media did nothing, and by doing nothing, became complicit in all of Biden’s #MeToo moments.

And, my God, look at them all.

Look at this…

Oh, sure, the media will go after Biden now, but only because it suits their far-left agenda, only because there is now political upside for their rancid identity politics crusade, and Biden’s an old, white guy.

On Saturday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s “Fox & Friends,” Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani stated if the entire Mueller report can be released legally, “put out all of it.”

Giuliani said, “As far as I’m concerned, if they can put it out legally, put out all of it.”

Giuliani further criticized the April 2 deadline set by Democrats in Congress to release the report, stating, “You cannot disclose grand jury material. It is a crime. Now, they can say April 2, but Bill Barr and Rod Rosenstein are not going to jail because they have an unrealistic deadline. So, they may have to go to court and get a court order.”

During Friday’s Democratic Weekly Address, Senator Tina Smith (D-MN) called on Congress to “bring all the ideas to the table and take action on climate. Taking decisive action is good for our health, good for our environment, and good for our economy.”

Transcript as Follows:

“Hi, I am Tina Smith, Senator from Minnesota.

Today, I want to talk with you about climate change.

But before that, I’d like to briefly address the recent news about the Special Counsel’s investigation. In this great country, the government is ultimately accountable to the public, so it is essential that the American people have the opportunity to read the entire Mueller report, and evaluate the investigation’s findings for themselves.

Our democratic principles demand transparency and accountability. Attorney General Barr must release the Mueller report in full.

Now, climate change is an urgent problem. And we Democrats are united in agreement that:

1) climate change is real;

2) it’s caused by human activity; and

3) Congress should take immediate and bold action to address this challenge.

These points should not be controversial. And the conclusion that climate change is an urgent problem is supported by an overwhelming weight of scientific evidence. Unfortunately, too many Republicans in Washington right now—and particularly our current President—refuse to accept these facts.

We can’t respond to this crisis until both parties acknowledge that we have a crisis.

Recently, Democrats asked for a bipartisan Special Committee on the Climate Crisis. When Republicans refused, we forged ahead by appointing ten Democratic members to Senate Democrats’ Special Committee on Climate Change. I’m very happy to be one of the Senators.

Our new committee will work together with colleagues in the House of Representatives. We will highlight how the climate crisis is harming the economic and national security interests of the United States, and we’ll set the stage for bold action on climate.

There was a time when Republican Senators were also leaders in calling for climate action.

In the early 2000s, Senator John McCain of Arizona pushed a strong bipartisan plan to bring greenhouse gas emissions under control in our country. As recently as 2011, there were other ambitious, bipartisan plans in the Senate to tackle climate change.

And then the Republican Party gave up on taking action. But the problem hasn’t gone away. Instead, it grows much worse.

The good news is that young people are leading the way on this issue, and we need to listen to them.

In the Senate, there are small signs of bipartisan progress. For example, there have been multiple bills to encourage carbon capture and storage technologies. One was signed into law just last year.

This helps, but we need bigger and bolder actions as well. I’m working on legislation to establish a national clean electricity standard, an approach that had bipartisan support in the Senate as recently as 2011.

In addition my Democratic colleagues are working on a range of actions, including renewable standards, cap and dividend proposals, and a carbon tax. Senators Tom Udall, Chris Van Hollen, Brian Schatz, and Sheldon Whitehouse lead those efforts. In addition, we should acknowledge that Senators Ed Markey and Jeff Merkley have long led bills to bring about comprehensive climate action. We need to get all the good ideas we can out on the table. And we need the Republicans to come with ideas of their own.

Just this week, Republican Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee proposed a ‘Manhattan Project for Clean Energy’, reviving an idea he pushed a decade ago, which would increase funding for energy research. This is promising.

So let’s bring all the ideas to the table and take action on climate. Taking decisive action is good for our health, good for our environment, and good for our economy. America can either follow or lead on climate change. Democrats think we should lead.”


Hollywood threatened Georgia with a boycott if the state passed a bill that limited abortions to the first six weeks. Peach State lawmakers passed the bill and left-wing celebrities are erupting.

As Breitbart News reported Friday, Hollywood has lined up to warn the state that they would take their business out of Georgia if the “Heartbeat bill,” H.B. 481, passed, a bill that would ban abortion after a heartbeat could be detected in a fetus.

In a letter written by actress-turned-activist Alyssa Milano, stars threaten to “do everything in our power to move our industry to a safer state for women if H.B. 481 becomes law.”

Ben Stiller, Amy Schumer, Rosie O’Donnell, Debra Messing, Alec Baldwin, Sarah Silverman all signed the letter.

After the Georgia House voted to pass H.B. 481 Friday, Milano simply said, “Fuck. This.”

“I guess we won’t be shooting movies and TV in Georgia anymore if this moves forward,” director Judd Apatow declared.

Kabul (AFP) – Taliban fighters on Saturday attacked a convoy carrying Afghanistan’s vice president Abdul Rashid Dostum, in an assault that left the former warlord unscathed but killed one of his bodyguards, an official told AFP.

Enayatullah Babur, Dostum’s former chief of staff, said the hour-long attack also left several others in the convoy wounded.

The attack occurred in the northern province of Balkh, where Dostum had held a rally earlier in the day.

On Twitter, a Taliban spokesman said the insurgent group had carried out the attack and claimed four of Dostum’s bodyguards had been killed.

Dostum, a powerful ethnic Uzbek leader, is notorious in Afghanistan for extreme barbarities and for repeatedly switching loyalties over 40 years of conflict.

Despite a catalogue of war crimes attached to his name and accusations of organising the rape and torture of a political rival, Dostum became Afghanistan’s first vice president in 2014.

At the rally in Balkh, Dostum had claimed he could clear northern Afghanistan of the Taliban within six months — if only the government would let him.

In delayed elections now slated for September, President Ashraf Ghani has chosen to run with Amrullah Saleh, an ethnic Tajik, instead of Dostum.

Dostum has survived several other attempts on his life, including one claimed by the Islamic State group last July in Kabul that killed 23 people including AFP driver Mohammad Akhtar.


Brasília (AFP) – Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro arrives in Israel Sunday, where he will walk a diplomatic tightrope as he seeks to shore up ties with his right-wing counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu while keeping key Arab trade partners onside.

Bolsonaro’s controversial pledge to move Brazil’s embassy to Jerusalem is expected to be high on the agenda during the three-day visit as Netanyahu uses the occasion to boost his standing ahead of April 9 elections.

The Brazilian ex-army captain’s trip comes after his recent visits to the United States and Chile, as part of efforts to build ties with conservative governments around the world.

Neither Brazil nor Israel has released details of the visit, but Bolsonaro is expected to focus on correcting their lopsided trade relationship by boosting Brazilian exports, mainly soybeans and meat.

He is also expected to seek greater access to Israeli defense technology.

In 2018, Brazil’s exports to Israel were worth $321 million dollars, while imports, including fertilizers and chemical products, stood at $1.17 billion, official data shows.

But the issue of relocating Brazil’s embassy will likely dominate the visit, testing the tough-talking Bolsonaro’s diplomatic skills.

Months after promising the shift, which sparked an angry response from Palestinian leaders, Bolsonaro has yet to announce a timetable.

Speaking to reporters Thursday, Bolsonaro suggested he was in no hurry to make a decision.

“Trump took nine months to decide, to give his final word, so that the embassy was transferred,” Bolsonaro said.

“Perhaps now we will open a commercial office in Jerusalem.”

– Risky move –

While moving the embassy would please Bolsonaro’s evangelical Christian support base, it would run the risk of provoking commercial retaliation from Arab states, some of which are major importers of Brazilian meat.

The issue has “a very important symbolic weight,” said Paulo Kramer, a professor at the University of Brasilia.

“If he doesn’t announce it on the trip, it will frustrate his voters’ expectations and upset evangelical groups,” federal lawmaker Marcos Pereira, who is also president of a parliamentary Brazil-Israel friendship group, told AFP.

The decision to move the embassy is highly sensitive because Israel claims all of Jerusalem as its capital, while Palestinians view east Jerusalem as the capital of their future state.

Virtually all countries agree that Jerusalem’s status can only be defined through wider Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations.

So far, only the United States and Guatemala have broken with that consensus by opening embassies in Jerusalem. Paraguay backtracked on a decision last year to move its embassy. Israel and the US have spoken with Honduras about its embassy going to Jerusalem.

“Moving the embassy of any country… is a violation of international law and an attack on the Palestinian people,” the Palestinian envoy to Brazil, Ibrahim Alzeben, told AFP this week.

For Netanyahu, who faces a strong challenge from former military chief Benny Gantz in next month’s election, Bolsonaro’s visit will help him demonstrate that “he has friends around the world,” Raphael Eldad, Israeli ambassador to Brazil from 2011 to 2014, told AFP.

“In the international context, Israel cannot ignore friends.”


On Friday’s broadcast of HBO’s “Real Time,” host Bill Maher stated that Attorney General William Barr is a “stooge” who is engaging in behavior similar to “a high-tech coup.”

Maher said, “[Y]ou know, high-tech lynching. Remember that phrase? This is like a high-tech coup. I know Barr is an esteemed person, William Barr. He’s a stooge. This is what Third World countries do. The dictator appoints somebody who exonerates him. That’s what happened here.”

He later added, “I think the whole point of what Barr did was to give Trump a month-long lead to get out there and do the end zone dance, put the bullshit out, I’m completely exonerated. Because then, when we come up with the other stuff, it’s a month later, and then we’re like undoing something.”

On Friday’s broadcast of HBO’s “Real Time,” host Bill Maher stated that if the Trump campaign’s actions don’t amount to collusion, “Then the law is wrong.”

Former U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said, “The thing that Bob Mueller found, is that, based on the criminal statutes, he could not prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, presumably, that there was a conspiracy before the fact, an agreement, a meeting of the minds, about doing those bad things.”

Bharara added that the Trump camp did things that were wrong, but that a prosecutor’s job is “narrow.”

Maher responded, “Then the law is wrong. If all that doesn’t add up to collusion, then the law is f*cked up.”

Friday on MSNBC’s “All In,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) commented on the Republican blowback to her so-called Green New Deal proposal.

After playing several video clips of Republicans linking her proposal to socialism and criticizing the cost, host Chris Hayes asked if she expected the “24-hour AOC and GND” obsession on conservative media.

Ocasio-Cortez said, “Well, I mean, it is next level. I didn’t expect them to make total fools of themselves.”

She added, “Frankly, I expected a little more nuance and a little more concerned trolling.”

Democrats, facing conservative resistance to New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s “Green New Deal,” are now pivoting toward other environmental legislation.

Ocasio-Cortez had an ambitious goal: 100% renewable energy by 2030, and a wave of “green” jobs to replace the ones lost in the abandonment of more traditional sources of power. But after heated debate with the other side of the aisle, many liberal politicians are pulling back from the freshman congresswoman’s radical vision.

On Tuesday, the Senate voted against crucial Green New Deal legislation. According to The Hill, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell “set up the vote to test the Democratic Party’s unity over climate change.” Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey introduced the Green New Deal to the Senate in February, and sees this failure as a call for action from Congress.

“We’re now in the process where the hearings have started on the House side,” Markey said. “Committee after committee have had the first hearings that haven’t been held for eight years. And ideas and legislation will start emanating from committee after committee looking specifically at what has to happen.”

But even Ocasio-Cortez and the advocacy groups who lent their weight to the Green New Deal have started to back down. Josh Nelson, co-director of progressive group Credo Action, has adjusted expectations:

Right now, our ask for members of the House and Senate is to co-sponsor the Green New Deal. With a climate change denier in the White House, we don’t anticipate this or any other legislation we support being signed into law in the next 21 months.

The Sunrise Movement — a youth-oriented advocacy initiative best known for their sit-in at Nancy Pelosi’s office demanding action on climate change — is also taking a big step away. Co-founder Varshini Prakash told reporters on Tuesday that the Green New Deal was “never created with the intention of passing.”

“Ocasio-Cortez’s office is working on legislation in coming weeks and months,” Sunrise Communications Director Stephen O’Hanlon told The Hill. “It won’t just be a resolution, it would be a bill that we’d want to pass through Congress that have the principles of the Green New Deal.”

The only one left giving full-throated support to the seemingly doomed environmental legislation is President Donald Trump, of all people. “I want them to keep going forward with it because I want to campaign against it,” he said, calling it “easy to beat.”

Job Creators Network President Alfredo Ortiz called out Democrats to Breitbart News radio listeners Friday morning for trying to push the multi-trillion Green New Deal through piecemeal.

Host Alex Marlow played a clip of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ranting about the Green New Deal this week. “People are dying, they are dying,” she said in the course of the diatribe against dissenters.

Cortez’s speech used South Bronx children suffering from asthma and children in Flint, Michigan, along with claims that their illnesses resulted from climate change. She called climate change a “national crisis,” comparing it to the Great Depression and WWII.

“The cost of pursuing the Green New Deal will be far less than the cost of not passing it,” Cortez claimed.

Ortiz called Cortez passionate. He said his heart goes out to the kids in Flint, the kids in south Bronx, but it doesn’t have to do with climate change, it has to do with government.

Ortiz reminded listeners that one cost estimate for the Green New Deal was $93 trillion. “It’s no wonder that not a single Senator, not a single Democrat Senator, not even the sponsor himself, voted for the Green- they just voted present.”

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has revealed that Democrats will break up portions of the Green New Deal to consider individually.

“They’re famous for doing this,” Ortiz said. “This is what the Democrats do. They love incrementalizing their way to what they want…we need to call that out.”

“Somebody needs to call b.s. on these people,” said Ortiz, who then pointed to Cortez’s critical influence in killing a deal to bring a second Amazon headquarters to New York. Amazon estimated it would hire 40,000 and Ortiz added that this could have brought in a ripple effect totaling 120,000 new jobs for a “blighted area.”

JCN has run several billboards in New York aimed at Rep. Cortez and the part she played in keeping Amazon and resulting jobs and revenue out of New York.

During a town hall on MSNBC on Friday, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) stated that the Green New Deal isn’t just about climate, but is also about the economy and social and racial justice. She added that the U.S. has “confronted this type of stagnation and this type of systemic threat” before during the Great Depression, World War II, and the Cold War by mobilizing the economy.

Host Chris Hayes asked, “[T]he first big issue you’re doing is the Green New Deal. So, why this issue, front and center, first thing? What connects you to this?”

Ocasio-Cortez began by answering, “So, this issue is not just about our climate. First and foremost, we need to save ourselves, period.”

She continued, “But, how I access this issue is that I started looking at all of our problems. We have runaway income inequality. We are at one of our most unequal points, economically speaking, in American history. We are dealing with a crisis of how our economy is even made up. Our economy is increasingly financialized, which means we are making profits off of interest, off of leasing your phone, off of doing all of these things, but we aren’t producing and we aren’t innovating in the way that we need to as an economy. And I also was looking at our issues of social justice, social and racial justice, of which we are — which have a nexus here in the Bronx, and what I started thinking about, to myself, was, listen, we’re looking at all of these issues, Medicare for all, a living wage, tuition-free public colleges and universities, and there’s this false idea that we need to put them all in a line and say, do this or do that. … And then I started to realize that these are not different problems. These are all part of the same problem.”

Ocasio-Cortez added, “In the past, we’ve confronted this type of stagnation and this type of systemic threat as a country. First of all, we’ve been here before. We’ve been here before with the Great Depression. We’ve been here before with World War II, even the Cold War. And the answer has been an ambitious and directed mobilization of the American economy to direct — and solve our problem, our biggest problem. And historically speaking, we have mobilized our entire economy around war, but I thought to myself, it doesn’t have to be that way, especially when our greatest existential threat is climate change.”

Sydney (AFP) – The Sydney Opera House and the Harbour Bridge were plunged into darkness for an hour Saturday to raise awareness about climate change and its impact on the planet’s vanishing biodiversity.

The 13th edition of Earth Hour, organised by the green group WWF, will see millions of people across 180 countries turn off their lights at 8:30 pm local time to highlight energy use and the need for conservation.

“We are the first generation to know we are destroying the world. And we could be the last that can do anything about it,” the charity said.

“We have the solutions, we just need our voices to be heard.”

WWF-Australia CEO Dermot O’Gorman told AFP that “Earth hour still is the world’s largest grassroots movement for people to take action on climate change”.

“It’s about individuals taking personal action but joining with hundreds of millions of people around the world to show that not only do we need urgent action on climate change but we need to be protecting our planet,” he added.

Dozens of companies around the world have said they will join in this year’s switch-off.

The event comes after some of the most dire warnings yet on the state of Earth’s natural habitat and species.

WWF’s own “Living Planet” report in October said that 60 percent of all animals with a backbone — fish, birds, amphibians, reptiles and mammals — had been wiped out by human activity since 1970.

Another dataset confirmed the depth of an unfolding mass extinction event, only the sixth in the last half-billion years.

Paris’s Eiffel Tower, New York’s Empire State Building, Dubai’s Burj Khalifa and the Acropolis in Athens are among the 24 global landmarks that will take part in Earth Hour.

Last year’s event was observed in more than 7,000 towns and cities in 187 countries, according to organisers.

While the lights-off event is a symbolic gesture, Earth Hour has led successful campaigns over the past decade to ban plastics in the Galapagos Islands and plant 17 million trees in Kazakhstan.

The Hague (AFP) – Teaching cows to use the toilet is not the easiest task, but a Dutch inventor is banking on a new bovine urinal to help cut emissions that cause environmental damage.

Tests have started on a farm in the Netherlands on the device which collects some of the 15 to 20 litres of urine that the average cow produces a day.

That produces huge amounts of ammonia in a country like the Netherlands, which is the world’s second biggest agricultural exporter after the United States.

“We are tackling the problem at the source,” Henk Hanskamp, the Dutch inventor and businessman behind the “Cow Toilet”, told AFP Friday.

“A cow is never going to be completely clean but you can teach them to go to the toilet.”

The way the toilet works is “udderly” ingenious.

The urinal is in a box placed behind the cow, while in front is a feeding trough. Once the animal finishes eating a robot arm stimulates a nerve near the udders, which then makes it want to urinate.

The cow toilets are currently being tested on a farm near the eastern Dutch town of Doetinchem and seven of its 58 cows have already learned how to use them without the need for stimulation.

“The cows have got used to it,” Hanskamp said. “They recognise the box, lift their tail, and pee.”

“The stables have become cleaner and the ground is drier. Less damp ground is better for the health of the cows’ hooves,” Jan Velema, a vet who took part in the tests, was quoted as saying by De Volkskrant newspaper.

The Netherlands is already introducing stricter rules on emissions of ammonia, which can cause atmospheric pollution and irritate the eyes in humans.

The chemical can also be implicated in the creation of environmentally damaging algae blooms when it mixes with water.

Hanskamp, whose company develops agricultural machinery, says it could “reduce by at least half the amount of ammonia produced” were the cow to urinate on open ground.

The company aims to have them on the market by 2020, he said.

Jon Snow, star anchor for publicly-owned Channel 4 News, has drawn criticism for appearing to racialise a protest in support of Brexit yesterday, claiming he had “never seen so many white people in one place”.

Snow, himself a white, upper-middle-class son of a Church of England bishop, made the controversial observation while closing out his on-the-ground coverage of a long day of protest against the Government, Members of Parliament, and the European Council coming together to delay Brexit, which was originally scheduled for 11 p.m. on March 29th, but has now been pushed to at least April or May, and may yet be postponed beyond 2019 or cancelled altogether.

The British people voted to Leave the European Union in June 2016, despite Remainers heavily outspending Leavers and receiving direct assistance from the Government of the day under David Cameron, almost three years ago.

“There are crowds rallying outside Downing Street. We’ve just got these pictures in which were taken nearby,” the presenter narrated, as Channel 4 cut to footage of protesters outside the gates which seal off the cul-de-sac where the official residences of the Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer are located from the public.

“Police are now wearing riot gear. Police dogs are patrolling. The mood has changed.

“We cannot confirm whether any arrests have been made.

“It has been the most extraordinary day. A day which has seen — I’ve never seen so many white people in one place!” he exclaimed, seemingly horrified.

“It’s an extraordinary story — there are people everywhere, there are crowds everywhere.”

Snow’s comments were criticised by many members of the public, including Conservative Party activist and first-generation immigrant Amandeep Singh Bhogal, who posted pictures from a Brexit rally in Parliament Square captioned, “I have never seen so many PATRIOTS in one place.”

“Regardless of whether you voted Leave or Remain can we all agree @jonsnowC4 was wrong to bring people’s skin colour into the Brexit debate,” another observer added.

“It’s utterly irrelevant. People of all racial backgrounds voted for Brexit and Remain.”

I remember Jon Snow visiting a village fete here in Wiltshire, and expressing how surprised and appalled he was how few black faces there were. It revealed a lack of awareness of the ethnic composition of districts outside London. Wiltshire is 96.7% white whereas London is 59.8%. — Guy Walters (@guywalters) March 30, 2019

Others questioned how likely it really was that Snow had “never seen so many white people in one place” before, considering he was born in 1947 when Britain’s visible ethnic minority population numbered only a few thousands.

He also spent much of his youth in boarding schools, one run by his bishop father, which were dominated by England’s predominantly white elite class.

Channel 4 claimed they had reprimanded their anchor, telling the Huffington Post that he was “spoken to and reminded of his responsibilities around due impartiality”.

PARIS (AP) – French yellow vest protesters are rallying to support an activist injured in a confrontation with police.

The demonstrators are undeterred by protest bans or repeated injuries in 20 weeks of demonstrations. So they’re marching again Saturday in Paris, Bordeaux and other cities to keep pressing President Emmanuel Macron to do more to help the working classes, redesign French politics – or step down altogether.

They’re also showing solidarity with Genevieve Legay, a 73-year-old anti-globalization activist who suffered a head injury in the southern city of Nice last weekend. The Nice prosecutor said a police officer pushed her down.

“We are all Genevieve!” read an online appeal for Saturday’s protests.

The main Paris protest will start to weave through the Left Bank and past the Eiffel Tower. Protests are banned around the Champs-Elysees, scene of recent rioting.

Italy’s populist Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini has called for the “chemical castration” of three men who allegedly filmed themselves raping a 19-year-old American tourist in Catania.

The three Italian men, Roberto Mirabella, 20, Salvatore Castrogiovanni, 19, and Agatino Spampinato, also 19, were arrested on March 21st for the gang rape attack, said to have occurred on March 15th, Il Giornale reports.

According to investigators, the three men met up with the American teen at a bar and offered her a drink. They allegedly suggested moving to another bar and once outside forced her into a car.

After driving to a secluded area, the three men are accused of preventing the teen from calling the police and taking turns sexually assaulting her and filming the ordeal on their mobile phones.

Salvini, who also serves as Minister of the Interior, was direct in his condemnation of the attack and the alleged attacker,s saying, “For the raping worms of Catania, who have raped a tourist, no discount: a certainty of punishment and chemical castration!”

Earlier this week, Minister for Public Administration Giulia Bongiorno submitted an amendment to a bill to make the use of chemical castration for rapists an option for the courts.

“We have submitted an amendment to the Chamber to insert the possibility of subordinating the suspension of the sentence to a therapeutic or pharmacological inhibitory treatment of the libido,” she said.

“The League party has been supporting this measure for some time; indeed it is one of the reasons, along with ‘legitimate defence’, that has brought me closer to them,” she added, referring to the populist party’s push for stronger self-defence laws.

Salvini recently passed a law on the legitimate use of force against home invaders, who will now be allowed to use force against those attempting to break into their homes.

The populist party leader has previously gone on record stating he would like to see Italy’s gun laws liberalised and previously even offered to pay the legal costs of people prosecuted for defending their homes.

Italy’s populist Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini has called for the “chemical castration” of three men who allegedly filmed themselves raping a 19-year-old American tourist in Catania.

The three Italian men, Roberto Mirabella, 20, Salvatore Castrogiovanni, 19, and Agatino Spampinato, also 19, were arrested on March 21st for the gang rape attack, said to have occurred on March 15th, Il Giornale reports.

According to investigators, the three men met up with the American teen at a bar and offered her a drink. They allegedly suggested moving to another bar and once outside forced her into a car.

After driving to a secluded area, the three men are accused of preventing the teen from calling the police and taking turns sexually assaulting her and filming the ordeal on their mobile phones.

The Danish government has agreed this week to refuse to allow children born to Danish Islamic State fighters overseas to claim citizenship and a passport.

The policy comes after the government brokered a deal with the populist Danish People’s Party (DF), ending the previous policy which allowed the children of Islamic State fighters from Denmark the ability to claim citizenship, broadcaster DR reports.

The measure was backed by foreign minister Inger Støjberg, who is well-known for her tough stance against mass migration, who said, “They are born of parents who have turned their backs on Denmark and therefore they should not belong to Denmark.”

Støjberg has become well-known for her tough migration policies which have included rejecting European Union migrant quotas after arguing that not enough migrants contribute to Danish society, and arguing that migrants should “adjust to Danish values.”

Christian Langballe, a spokesman for the DF, welcomed the proposal, saying the party had pushed for such a measure for an extended period of time.

“They are born down there, they have never known Denmark, they have no connection with Denmark, and we must remember that it is the parents who have chosen to go down in the war zone to fight for the Islamic State,” Langballe said.

It will also now be possible for the Danish government to strip the citizenship of Islamic State members who are dual nationals without going through the court system.

“We don’t want them back home.,” Langballe said and added, “We have seen returning Syrian warriors, for example, returning to France. Here they committed this terrible terrorist attack on, among other things, the Bataclan venue and murdered 129 people.”

The danger of returning fighters has also become an issue in neighbouring Sweden where it has been alleged that some have begun attempting to recruit young people in underground mosques in the city of Malmö.

Støjberg agreed, saying that if the fighters have another citizenship then she saw no reason for them to ever return to Denmark. “They are undesirable in Denmark,” she said.

BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) – Voters in Slovakia are selecting a new head of state in a runoff that could give the country its first female president.

Zuzana Caputova, an environmental activist, is up against European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic in the vote for the largely ceremonial post in the nation of 5.4 million.

Caputova won the first round two week ago with 40.6 percent of the vote while Sefcovic was a distant second with 18.7 percent.

Caputova attracts voters appalled by corruption and mainstream politics. Sefcovic is a career diplomat who is supported by the leftist Smer-Social Democracy party, a major force in Slovak politics.

The winner will become the country’s fifth head of state since Slovakia gained independence in 1993 after Czechoslovakia split in two.

Incumbent Andrej Kiska did not stand for a second term.

On Friday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “MTP Daily,” House Judiciary Committee member Jamie Raskin (D-MD) commented on Attorney General William Barr’s letter about the release of the Mueller report by saying, “it’s somewhat inscrutable, but disturbing what the attorney general has written here.”

Raskin said, “In this one, he says that the president has the opportunity to exercise executive privilege over some parts of it, but the president has deferred to him instead. So, he’s not going to pre-clear the report with the president. But does that mean that Attorney General Barr is going to be excising parts of the report, asserting the executive privilege for the president? Again, it’s somewhat inscrutable, but disturbing what the attorney general has written here.”

Attorney General William Barr told congressional leaders he plans to release a redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller’s nearly 400-page report on alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in the 2016 presidential election by mid-April.

“Everyone will soon be able to read it on their own,” Barr wrote in a letter to Republican and Democrat leaders in the House and Senate on Friday.

The Justice Department head also stated he is prepared to testify before both the Senate and House Judiciary committees regarding Mueller’s findings on May 1st-2nd. Barr told lawmakers while President Trump could assert executive privilege on certain materials, the president intends to “defer to me” on such matters. He also said the Justice Department has no plans to provide the Mueller report to the White House.

The development comes after the Justice Department announced Sunday that Mueller’s investigation did not find evidence that the Trump campaign “conspired or coordinated” with Russia in the last election. Barr said that Mueller did not “exonerate” the president of obstructing justice, noting that his summary “sets out evidence on both sides of the question.”

Meanwhile, top House Democrats have made repeated calls for the entire report to be made public. Appearing Wednesday on SiriusXM Progress channel’s Make It Plain, House Speaker Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said it was “a little bit arrogant” of Barr to believe Democrats would accept only seeing his four-page summary of Mueller‘s report.

“We just haven’t even seen the Mueller report, and we don’t expect to accept just the attorney general’s interpretation of it. A little bit arrogant of him to think that that would be the case,” Pelosi said. “We have to get the report. They, to their peril, will keep that report.”

Despite Mueller’s findings, numerous Democrats such as House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) refuse to concede the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin. In an interview with the Washington Post Wednesday, the California Democrat said he believes “Undoubtedly there is collusion.”

“We will continue to investigate the counterintelligence issues. That is, is the president or people around him compromised in any way by a hostile foreign power? … It doesn’t appear that was any part of Mueller’s report,” he told the Post.

House Intelligence Committee Republicans on Thursday called on Schiff to step down as chairman from the powerful panel, citing his consistent promotion of the “demonstrably false” Trump-Russia collision narrative.

Thursday on the Senate floor, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said Attorney General William Barr delaying the release of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report had “the odor of political expediency” to help President Donald Trump.

Partial transcript as follows:

SCHUMER: Yesterday, for the second time this week, Leader McConnell blocked our request made by the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Dianne Feinstein, to make public the full report authored by special counsel Mueller. I want to thank Senator Feinstein for making the request and for standing up for transparency. As Senator Feinstein said, a four-page summary from a political appointee is hardly a sufficient substitute for special counsel Mueller’s two-year investigation.

There are reports this morning that the Mueller report is over 300 pages. All we have gotten is four-page summary by someone appointed by the administration, who before he took office felt the president could never, almost never, be called for obstruction of justice, one of the main parts of the Mueller investigation. For Mr. Barr to quickly issue a four-page report in his attempt to try and exonerate President Trump and now to delay the release of an over 300-page report written by Mueller, so the American people and we senators and congressmen can see what was written, has too much of the odor of political expediency to help the man who appointed him, President Trump.

The American people have a right to know the full scope of the facts behind Russia’s interference in our election. The American people have a right to make their own conclusions about actions taken by this administration. The American people deserve to have full confidence in the integrity of our system and the impartiality of the rule of law, and only the full release of the report can affirm that. What I’m saying here shouldn’t be controversial. In the House, it passed 420-0 to make the resolution—the resolution to make the full report public. Voted for by such partisan defenders of the president like Representative Jordan and Representative Meadows. And transparency, we all know, is all the more important because the attorney general has made no secret of his antipathy toward this investigation and appears intent on holding the report secret for as long as possible. I guess his hope is let the dust settle and then no one will pay attention. Well, he’s wrong about that. He’s prolonging this thing. Remember, this attorney general made clear that he was hostile to the special counsel and opposed to Mueller’s inquiry into obstruction of justice, and then he opines about it two days later without showing anybody any backing? That is so wrong.

According to press reports on his phone call yesterday with Mr. Nadler, Mr. Barr would not even commit to releasing the whole report at any time. He wouldn’t commit to a date. He wasn’t even willing to disclose how many pages are in the counsel’s report, as if that were some kind of state secret. Since that conversation, there are reports it is over 300 pages. If it is, it’s just disgraceful for Mr. Barr, who was able to read through it and summarize it in 48 hours to say now he can’t release it because he is busy culling it. The administration, the attorney general must end the stalling and the secrecy. It’s not going to be a happy opening chapter for the attorney general when history looks back upon what he has done. We should make the report public now.

Friday on MSNBC’s “Deadline,” network host Al Sharpton said an impeachment process against former president Richard Nixon was in part for obstruction of justice, so President Donald Trump could still be in trouble.

Sharpton said, “You have to ask the question, why did everybody lie if there was nothing to lie about? Whether he was a useful idiot or whether he was greedy trying to get a deal in Moscow for the Trump organization — because remember he never thought he would win for president—and whether they were maneuvering him, I think Putin—Trump and I both come from New York.”

“There’s a game in Times Square, they beat you out of your money, Three-Card Monty, Putin could have been been playing him, you know he wants a hotel, I’ll do this, do that, and then they had to obstruct justice because they got out too far,” he continued. “They woke up not on Fifth Avenue. They were in the White House. That’s why I want to know where obstruction. Obstruction does not mean you colluded. Obstruction means you obstructed. Nixon may never have known about the break-in and who would pay for it, but when he participated in the cover-up, that’s when the Republicans said he had to go. So I don’t care if he was a conspirator in the beginning, an idiot in the middle or someone that obstructed at the end, we need to know.”

Students at Dickinson College are taking issue with signs around campus that encourage students to take the stairs instead of elevators to improve their health. The students reportedly consider the signs “fat shaming,” as they promote the “dangerous narrative” that weight loss as “a positive thing.”

According to a report from the Dickinson College student newspaper, students were offended this month by a series of signs around campus that encourage students to avoid elevators. “Why not take the stairs if you are physically able?” the signs read. “Exercise and strengthen your heart and muscles.”

One student said that the signs made her feel guilty. She said that taking the stairs often caused her to feel dizzy. “I began to feel guilty every time that I took the elevator,” the student said. “I started realizing that I shouldn’t put my body through pain or stress when there is an elevator I could use,” she said.

Another student said that the signs were “fat shaming.” “These signs were effectively fat shaming as they promoted weight loss as a positive thing,” the student said. “It had a negative impact on campus to have a series of signs that glorified a dangerous narrative that feeds into eating disorders.”

Marni Jones, the dean and director of access and disability services at Dickinson College, said that the sign could be offensive to students who are forced to use elevators.

“Even with the qualifier “if you are physically able,” seeing a sign like this can feel shaming to those who have no choice but to use the elevator,” Jones said in a comment to the student newspaper. “I showed a picture of one of the posters to a student with a mobility impairment, who has difficulty using steps after having had four hip surgeries, to see what she thought about it, and she was visibly dejected upon reading it, saying, ‘That’s really unfair. You don’t know what other people are going through.’”

Australian Researchers have produced a study that has led them to believe the word “cyclists” should be banned, because it “dehumanizes” people who ride bikes.

Researchers at Queensland University of Technology and Monash University claim to have found a link between the word “cyclists” and a tendency for motorists to “dehumanize” bikers, according to the Daily Mail.

Queensland University Professor Narelle Haworth claimed the study found 55 percent of non-cyclists surveyed in Victoria, NSW, and Queensland felt that cyclists were “not completely human.”

With those results in hand, Haworth is advocating for an end to the use of the word “cyclists.”

Haworth, who is also Director of the Centre for Accident Research and Road Safety in Queensland, insisted that the elimination of the word would help bike rider safety.

“If we used the term people on bikes, instead of cyclists, we’re giving a term that is more human-like and less like a species,” Haworth told Daily Mail.

“We need to spread the idea that those people [cyclists] could be any of us. There is need to grow a culture of mutual respect for people on bikes,” Hayworth added.

The study also reportedly found that one in ten drivers would purposefully block bike riders and admitted to cutting off bikers in the past. Others admitted to yelling at bikers and even throwing things at them.

The professor insisted that eliminating the word would take some of the sting out of the negativity between bike riders and motorists.

Jakarta (AFP) – A pair of bare-breasted mermaid statues have been given the family values treatment at an Indonesian amusement park where officials slipped golden tube tops over their chests.

While the nude statues have been on display for years at Jakarta’s Ancol Dreamland, a recent policy aimed at respecting “Eastern values” has seen the mermaids get an official cover-up.

The statues were initially just covered with gold fabric, but they’ve now also been moved to a more secluded area after visitors kept pulling the coverings down, park sources told AFP.

Ancol Dreamland spokeswoman Rika Lestari insisted no outside agitators were behind the cover-up.

“There was no pressure from any group,” she said. “Ancol is trying to become an amusement park and vacation spot for families.”

That didn’t stop the park’s move from being widely mocked.

“Thanks Ancol. Now, no one will commit adultery of the eyes from looking at the mermaids’ breasts,” comedian Soleh Solihun wrote on Twitter.

Earlier, Lestari told the Indonesian newspaper Kompas: “We’re Eastern people, we have Eastern culture, so what was inappropriate we made it more appropriate.

“It’s just a matter of perception, because what we’ve done was the best for us. It’s a good thing, so why not.”

Indonesia is the world’s biggest Muslim majority country and relatively conservative social values are prevalent.

That didn’t stop the park’s move from being widely mocked.

“Thanks Ancol. Now, no one will commit adultery of the eyes from looking at the mermaids’ breasts,” comedian Soleh Solihun wrote on Twitter.

Earlier, Lestari told the Indonesian newspaper Kompas: “We’re Eastern people, we have Eastern culture, so what was inappropriate we made it more appropriate.

“It’s just a matter of perception, because what we’ve done was the best for us. It’s a good thing, so why not.”

Indonesia is the world’s biggest Muslim majority country and relatively conservative social values are prevalent.


Former Nevada Assemblywoman Lucy Flores, now a Social Justice Activist, revealed that Vice President Joe Biden was “creepy” with her during a campaign event.

She said in an essay for The Cut that the incident occurred during her campaign for lieutenant governor in Nevada in 2014, when Biden came to the state to help the campaign.

But before the campaign rally, he touched her in a way that she felt was inappropriate:

I was taking deep breaths and preparing myself to make my case to the crowd, I felt two hands on my shoulders. I froze. “Why is the vice-president of the United States touching me?” I felt him get closer to me from behind. He leaned further in and inhaled my hair. I was mortified. I thought to myself, “I didn’t wash my hair today and the vice-president of the United States is smelling it. And also, what in the actual fuck? Why is the vice-president of the United States smelling my hair?” He proceeded to plant a big slow kiss on the back of my head. My brain couldn’t process what was happening. I was embarrassed. I was shocked. I was confused. There is a Spanish saying, “tragame tierra,” it means, “earth, swallow me whole.” I couldn’t move and I couldn’t say anything. I wanted nothing more than to get Biden away from me. My name was called and I was never happier to get on stage in front of an audience.

Flores said that pictures of Biden touching other women inappropriately made it more difficult to keep silent, referring to Biden nuzzling the neck of Secretary of Defense Secretary Ash Carter’s wife, kissing Sen. Chuck Grassley’s wife on the lips, whispering in women’s ears, and snuggling women on the campaign trail.

“I may have been able to give Biden the benefit of the doubt. Had there not been multiple articles written over the years about the exact same thing — calling his creepy behavior an ‘open secret’ — perhaps it would feel less offensive,” she wrote. “And yet despite the steady stream of pictures and the occasional article, Biden retained his title of America’s Favorite Uncle.”

Biden has earned some negative attention for his past behavior, including mockery from Jon Stewart in a 2015 Daily Show segment.

“Apparently, the Senate rite of passage is you’re not really sworn in until ‘Delaware Joe’ has felt up one member of your immediate family,” Stewart joked.

Flores said that she felt that it was important for her to speak out, as Biden was considering a run for president in 2020.

Following the release of the “no collusion” Mueller report, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has led the charge to focus on saving the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare as the government-run health care program faces an uncertain future.

Democrats have introduced legislation that would reduce health insurance premiums, protect people with pre-existing conditions, and place restrictions on some types of insurance.

The move has gained support from a lot of Democrats, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (R-NY), the New York Times reported.

But Ocasio-Cortez’s former mentor disagrees. When asked by reporters about it, presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) had a one-word response: “No.”

The Times reported:

“No,” he said again, when pressed. “The incremental reform that I support is phasing in ‘Medicare for all.’” Mr. Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont, is not one to compromise on his long-held policy positions, especially his signature stance on health care, though he has, in fact, supported non-“Medicare for all” legislation in the past, including backing a 2017 bill to allow people to buy into state Medicaid plans. Mr. Sanders’s unflinching position is a reminder to voters that he is unabashedly left-wing and unlikely to worry about working within the confines of the existing system anytime soon. It also reflects a schism within the Democratic Party over the best way to recapture power in Washington: Should Democrats project big, bold policy ideas that could fundamentally alter the political structure but face long odds in a hyperpartisan Congress? Or should they present incremental measures that are more likely to appeal to the center and could succeed sooner?

The Times speculated about the other Democrats hoping to occupy the White House, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who wants to do both.

Other candidates, like Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), former Congressman Beto O-Rourke (D-TX) and even former Vice President Joe Biden — if he finally does get in the race — are taking a more bi-partisan approach, according to the Times.

“It is a debate that has raged within the party since before the midterm elections last year, with some strategists suggesting that bold, disruptive ideas like the ones championed by Mr. Sanders electrify voters and spur them to the polls,” the Times reported.

“Whoever is president next just can’t make incremental change,” Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser to the progressive political organizing group MoveOn.org, who worked on President Barack Obama’s 2008 and 2012 campaigns, said in the Times report. “We just have to be bold, and we have to take chances — people are hurting. We need to move forward in a big way.”

Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) said recently that the U.S. health care system is “broken” and also called for “Medicare for all.” But he also expressed support for “practical things,” like lowering drug prices — an issue popular on both sides of the aisle.

“The path to the White House and to majorities has to be in a pragmatic, progressive area,” Jim Kessler, executive vice president for policy at Third Way, a leftist think tank, said in the Times report. “If you go too far left, Donald Trump gets re-elected, and Republicans control both houses of Congress.”

Robert Francis ‘Beto’ O’Rourke will cross Texas with three rallies to officially kick off his 2020 presidential campaign Saturday.

The failed 2018 Senate candidate will start with a 10:00 a.m. rally in El Paso, Texas, O’Rourke’s hometown. The event will be live-streamed to O’Rourke’s Facebook page. The event will take place at the intersection of El Paso St. and Overland Ave.

Texas Southern University will host O’Rourke’s second rally of the day in Houston at 5:00 p.m. local time.

O’Rourke’s third and final stop of the day will be at 9th and Congress in Austin, Texas, from 9:00-11:00 p.m. local time.

The Texas events require attendees to RSVP to get tickets.

O’Rourke has been traveling around the country campaigning since announcing his candidacy on March 14.

The Texas Democrat politician raked in massive record fundraising totals during his 2018 Senate run and came within striking distance of his opponent, incumbent Republican Senator Ted Cruz.

Democrats have long sought to capture a presidential election win in the red state. O’Rourke has trailed Democrat frontrunners in the growing list of 2020 presidential candidates. CNN posted results of a Quinnipiac poll released Thursday showing O’Rourke at 12 percent behind former Vice President Joe Biden’s 29 percent and Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 19 percent.

The freshman class in the House have brought “firsts” to Capitol Hill, including a change of rules to allow Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) to wear a hijab on the House floor and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez introducing the controversial Green New Deal resolution that has put socialism in the spotlight.

When Jennifer Wexton (D-VA) was sworn in in January, she was the first to hang a transgender flag outside of her office in the Longworth Office Building.

“When I was sworn in less than three months ago I was the only member of Congress to hang a transgender flag outside of my office,” Wexton said on Thursday at a press conference announcing the passage in the House of a resolution to oppose President Donald Trump’s order that members of the U.S. military must serve according to their biological sex at birth.

“It attracted some attention,” Wexton said. “But I would suggest that all of you go over to any of the office buildings across the street after this press conference and you will see scores of the same flag hanging outside of members’ offices proudly.”

“And I hung the flag not just because this community is under attack from the current administration but because the transgender community are my family and my friends,” said Wexton, who has told reporters she is an aunt to a transgender child.

“And guess what? They’re your family and your friends too,” Wexton said, adding that she believes Trump’s decision is based not on facts but “bigotry” and “hate.”

Media and social media has revealed that other lawmakers are following suit by hanging transgender flags, some in support of the transgenders in the military resolution and also to mark International Transgender Day of Visibility on Sunday.

I got a message from a mom of a transgender teen in #CA25. She saw my colleagues hanging flags in honor of #TransVisibilityWeek and asked me to do the same — I was proud to say ours is already up. The halls of Congress are decked out to show our trans community #WontBeErased! pic.twitter.com/raRWygVJIU — Rep. Katie Hill (@RepKatieHill) March 27, 2019

“I got a message from a mom of a transgender teen in #CA25. She saw my colleagues hanging flags in honor of #TransVisibilityWeek and asked me to do the same — I was proud to say ours is already up,” announced Rep. Katie Hill (D-CA), who ran as a bisexual candidate and is married to a man.

“The halls of Congress are decked out to show our trans community #WontBeErased!” Hill tweeted.

Ben Rhodes, a former national security aide to President Barack Obama, told the New York Times this week that the “donor class” had prevented Obama from taking more anti-Israel steps than the administration had wanted to take.

Rhodes spoke to author Nathan Thrall for a feature article titled, “How the Battle Over Israel and Anti-Semitism Is Fracturing American Politics.” The headline describes “politics,” but Thrall focused on policy debates within the Democratic Party, which has seen the rise of an assertive anti-Israel constituency in recent years. That constituency has included overtly and unabashedly antisemitic critics, largely but not exclusively from the Muslim community.

Thrall writes about the “boycott, divestment, sanctions” (BDS) movement, which seeks to isolate Israel as apartheid South Africa was once isolated — a comparison that BDS critics find not only factually wrong, but also offensive.

Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), whose recent antisemitic remarks sparked turmoil within the House Democratic caucus, supports BDS (though Omar suggested otherwise to voters in her Minnesota’ district during the 2018 election).

One of Omar’s most notorious remarks was, “It’s all about the Benjamins,” followed by a claim that the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) bribes members of Congress to support Israel. (AIPAC does not endorse or donate to candidates.) Thrall notes that Jewish donors do figure disproportionately among the Democratic Party’s largest donors — though he allows that few of them “prioritize pro-Israel policies above all other issues.”

Enter Rhodes — one of the architects of the Iran nuclear deal, which was vehemently opposed by Israel and by pro-Israel Americans. He blamed Jewish donors for the Obama administration’s supposed restraint towards Israel:

According to Ben Rhodes, a former deputy national-security adviser and one of Obama’s closest confidants, several members of the Obama administration wanted to adopt a more assertive policy toward Israel but felt that their hands were tied. “The Washington view of Israel-Palestine is still shaped by the donor class,” Rhodes, who does not support B.D.S., told me, when I met with him at the Obama Foundation in October. “The donor class is profoundly to the right of where the activists are, and frankly, where the majority of the Jewish community is.”

Rhodes’s claims were echoed by “[a]nother former member of the Obama White House,” who told Thrall that the Obama administration had prevailed upon the United Nations Security Council to delay a vote against Israeli settlements in Judea and Samaria (the West Bank) to after the 2016 election. (The resolution also declared Israel’s presence in eastern Jerusalem — including the Jewish Quarter of the Old City, inhabited by Jews for millennia — to be illegal.)

But these claims are contradicted by the fact that after the Obama administration abstained, allowing such an anti-Israel resolution to pass for the first time, Jewish donors (and voters) hardly bolted from the Democratic Party.

Thrall noted: “The fear of losing Jewish donors as the party moves left on Israel may well be overstated.” He also observed that many Jewish donors to the Democratic Party have left-wing views on Israel. Yet the antisemitic canard that Jews use money to control U.S. foreign policy persists within the Democratic Party at the highest levels, and is used by insiders like Rhodes as an excuse — a scapegoat — to deflect criticism of insufficiently radical policy stances.

Notably, Rhodes was appointed by President Obama to the board of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council in the closing days of his administration. It was a controversial appointment, given Rhodes’s role as the “Iran deal salesman,” and Iran’s leading role in promoting Holocaust denial worldwide as an official ideology.

The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California ruled Friday that California’s ban on ammunition magazines holding more than ten rounds violates the Second Amendment.

On June 29, 2017, Breitbart News reported that U.S. District Judge Roger Benitez blocked the implementation of California’s “high-capacity” magazine ban two days before it was to go into effect. He noted that the ban could not survive the test of District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), noting: “When the simple test of Heller is applied … the statute is adjudged an unconstitutional abridgment.”

On July 17, 2018, a three-judge panel from the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld Benitez’s ruling, voting 2-to-1 against the ban and sending the case back to Benitez.

On March 29, 2019, Benitez again ruled against the ban, issuing an order barring California Attorney General Xavier Becerra from enforcing the ban.

Benitez again relied upon Heller, noting that “millions of ammunition magazines able to hold more than 10 rounds are in common use by law-abiding responsible citizens for lawful uses like self-defense. This is enough to decide that a magazine able to hold more than 10 rounds passes the Heller test.“

The case is Duncan v. Becerra, No. 2:17-cv-56-81 in the U.S. District Court for Southern California.

President Donald Trump announced Friday that Small Business Administrator Linda McMahon was leaving his cabinet and taking a position on his 2020 political action committee.

Trump announced the news during a short press conference on Friday at his club at Mar-a-Lago with McMahon and thanked her for her service to the country.

“This is an outstanding woman who has done an outstanding job,” Trump said. “And Linda I want to thank you very much.”

He hinted that he would appoint someone to replace McMahon “soon” and that it would be someone that was well known by the administration that would “fit beautifully” with his cabinet.

“Our country is doing really well, we’re the hottest country in the world economically and it’s going to stay that way for a long time to come,” Trump said.


President Donald Trump announced Friday that Small Business Administrator Linda McMahon was leaving his cabinet and taking a position on his 2020 political action committee.

Trump announced the news during a short press conference on Friday at his club at Mar-a-Lago with McMahon and thanked her for her service to the country.

“This is an outstanding woman who has done an outstanding job,” Trump said. “And Linda I want to thank you very much.”

He hinted that he would appoint someone to replace McMahon “soon” and that it would be someone that was well known by the administration that would “fit beautifully” with his cabinet.

President Trump must use his executive powers to take action on the soaring levels of illegal and unchecked immigration to the United States rather than delivering “empty threats,” columnist Michelle Malkin says.

In an exclusive interview with SiriusXM Patriot’s Breitbart News Daily, Malkin said Trump’s threats to close the U.S.-Mexico border to stop illegal immigration must be backed up with action, not just rhetoric.

Malkin said:

I don’t want to hear empty threats anymore about how he’s going to do what he should have done many, many, many months ago. The fact that you have a massive number now of … strangers bringing in children, tells you that the very magnet that he says he understands is causing this. The failure to just go ahead executively and fix the asylum system, proves him right on that and yet he’s not doing what he can do as president with his executive authority. [Emphasis added]

“What are you waiting for,” Malkin asked Trump. “Do it.”

Malkin said Trump should have the military at the southern border, asking rhetorically “Does he believe his own rhetoric or not?”

More blame for the levels of illegal immigration the country is currently experiencing should be placed with elected Republicans, Malkin said, who failed to take any action on immigration while controlling the House and Senate for the first two years of Trump’s term.

“Faux pro-borders Republicans … deserve a heck of a lot more scrutiny and condemnation for putting us in the situation that we’re in,” Malkin said.

Trump, Malkin said, must be vigilant in changing immigration policy and statute:

Here’s my fear, is that you know the conventional establishment talking point this week on immigration — even as these hordes of people are coming in unprecedented numbers — is ‘Oh, we got a few billion from the Pentagon for the fencing.’ And it just lulls the base into this false sense of hope that something is being done when we could have Congresspeople in Washington, themselves, putting pressure on Trump to exercise his inherent executive authority to actually do more than just put a few more dozen miles of physical barriers. And I’m not saying that we don’t need [a wall] but what needs to happen is that the policies need to change. [Emphasis added]

As Breitbart News has chronicled, the U.S. is set to admit anywhere between one to 1.5 million illegal aliens this year. The Trump administration’s most recent expansion of the Catch and Release policy has resulted in the release of about 24,000 border crossers and illegal aliens in just two weeks. Simultaneously, experts project that at the current rate of illegal immigration, up to 500,000 illegal aliens could successfully cross into the country this year, undetected by Border Patrol.

Republican voters rank deporting illegal aliens and ending illegal immigration as their top priority to ensure a better quality of life for themselves and their middle class families, the latest Pew Research Center survey revealed.

Former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach says President Trump’s delivery of wage hikes through stricter immigration enforcement in the interior of the United States has been a “massive accomplishment” for America’s blue-collar and working-class communities.

During a debate for IntelligenceSquared, Kobach touted Trump’s “Hire American” economy, which has delivered increased blue-collar and working-class wages by between 3.4 percent and four percent in the last 12 months.

“By reducing illegal immigration, you drive up wages, especially in unskilled labor categories,” Kobach said. “Therefore, [blue-collar workers] have seen those wage gains, and [Trump] has delivered.”

Kobach said:

In terms of wages, in the last 12 months, we’ve seen a 3.4 percent increase in nominal wages. That’s extraordinary, the largest wage gains in the last 12 years. It is a massive achievement for the working, blue-collar voter, and that’s why blue-collar voters in exit polls voted 66 percent for Donald Trump in the last election. He’s the only one that can pull it off again. [Emphasis added] [The wage gains are] a direct result of his positions and his policies on his signature campaign issue, which of course is immigration. President Trump has done what no other presidential candidate has done in recent years, made that a centerpiece issue and has governed with that as a centerpiece issue. He has recognized that illegal immigration really does affect all of us. Every state is a border state now. [Emphasis added]

Those wage hikes for America’s working and lower middle class and a populist-nationalist agenda are what must continue for Trump to capture states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan — as he did in 2016 — in the upcoming 2020 presidential election.

“I don’t know if any Republican can do what Trump did in those blue-collar states [of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin] and break through the Rust Belt,” Kobach said. “The party, after Trump, we may be toast if we don’t find somebody who has his special sauce who can connect with voters in those three states.”

Wage hikes for blue-collar and working-class Americans, though, are increasingly threatened by the record levels of illegal immigration coming across the U.S.-Mexico border, as well as the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) mass release of border crossers and illegal aliens into the interior of the country in recent months.

In just two weeks, 24,000 border crossers and illegal aliens have been released into interior of the U.S. https://t.co/u6gIClDF2t — John Binder 👽 (@JxhnBinder) March 26, 2019

Unfettered illegal immigration — along with the country’s mass legal immigration policy, where more than 1.2 million mostly unskilled foreign nationals are added to the population every year to compete against Americans for jobs — has kept Americans’ wages stagnant and low for decades.

Every one percent increase in the immigrant composition of American workers’ occupations reduces their weekly wages by about 0.5 percent, researcher Steven Camarotta has found. This means the average native-born American worker today has his weekly wages reduced by perhaps 8.5 percent because of current legal immigration levels — not factoring in the wage depression caused by illegal immigration.

In a state like Florida, where immigrants make up about 25.4 percent of the labor force, American workers have their weekly wages reduced by perhaps more than 12.5 percent. In California, where immigrants make up 34 percent of the labor force, American workers’ weekly wages are reduced by potentially 17 percent.

Likewise, every one percent increase in the immigrant composition of low-skilled U.S. occupations reduces wages by about 0.8 percent. Should 15 percent of low-skilled jobs be held by foreign-born workers, it would reduce the wages of native-born American workers by perhaps 12 percent.

In 2017, foreign-born residents made up more than 17 percent of the total U.S. workforce, comprising about 27.4 million foreign workers who compete against American workers for jobs. In occupations that have been relieved by stricter immigration enforcement, like dairy farming, U.S. wages have risen and so have working conditions as employers seek to attract talent in a tight labor market.

DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen will allow the importation of 30,000 extra foreign laborers for landscapers, resorts, and other businesses despite President Donald Trump’s “Hire American” promise that has helped raise blue-collar wages by four percent in 2018.

The decision will allow companies to import 96,000 H-2B laborers in 2019, up from the 66,000 allowed by the law.

NEW – DHS Sec Kirstjen Nielsen is asking for immediate action from Congress to address a “dire situation” at the border including a request for new authority to send unaccompanied minors back to their home countries. “Now we face a system-wide meltdown,” she wrote in a letter. pic.twitter.com/NMocGkaXVS — Katherine Faulders (@KFaulders) March 28, 2019

DHS spokeswoman Andrea Palermo explained Nielsen’s decision:

The Secretary continues to urge lawmakers to pursue a long-term legislative fix that both meets employers’ temporary needs while fulfilling the President’s Buy American and Hire American Executive Order to spur higher wages and employment rates for workers in the United States and to protect their economic interests.

Nielsen also said Congress should decide how many workers should be imported even though Congress allows companies to import at least one million visa workers each year — including at least 66,000 H-2B laborers — just as four million young Americans enter the job market.

Palermo said:

But the truth is that Congress is in the best position to know the appropriate number of H-2B visas that American businesses should be allocated without harming U.S. workers. Therefore, Congress – not DHS – should be responsible for determining whether the annual numerical limitations for H-2B workers set by Congress need to be modified, and by how much, and for setting parameters to ensure that enough workers are available to meet employers’ temporary needs throughout the year.

Many Democratic and GOP legislators want to provide employers with more workers, but they also know the H-2B program is unpopular. Since 2016, the legislators have repeatedly passed the buck to DHS by allowing the DHS secretary to authorize extra visas. This trick ensures that lobbyists and legislators apply closed-d00r pressure to get extra visas from the DHS secretary while also shielding the legislators from public opposition.

In 2018, Congress also voted to block Trump’s pro-American immigration reforms.

In February 2019, Congress quietly allowed Nielsen to provide up to 69,320 extra visas in a section added to the 2019 budget drafted by a small group of GOP and Democratic legislators. She approved 30,000 of the 69,320 — so loosening pressure on seasonal companies to find alternatives for the 2020 season.

Nielsen’s compromise reduces the opposition she faces in Congress as she tries to manage the sprawling DHS agency amid a migration wave from Central America.

H-2B workers can stay up to three years, depending on approval from the Department of Labor, so the resident population of H-2B workers may be far larger than the apparent 2019 limit of 96,000.

Company owners — especially the labor brokers who lease H-2Bs to many resorts and farms — want far more H-2Bs than Congress dare approve. For example, a landscaper in New Jersey called for one million H-2Bs:

#H2B what i just went through this morning. Well i will just say. We are not working today. Americans and Americanized no shows after 3days. 30k, we need the 69k.

There should be 1mil. Opened to stop illegal crossing. — Dennis Kaminski (@DennisKaminski8) March 29, 2019

Nielsen’s expansion of the program was slammed by pro-American groups.

“While Congress shoulders much of the blame for inexplicably authorizing an H-2B visa increase in the first place, the decision to actually go through with one was squarely in the hands of the Trump administration,” said a statement from Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform. The statement continued:

[W]hen given the opportunity to stand with the American worker, President Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen capitulated to the self-serving demands of business lobbyists and authorized 30,000 additional visas. While the economy is certainly roaring, it does not need a vast infusion of guest workers. This decision to allow tens of thousands more foreign workers to flood the labor market this year will not only suppress blue-collar wage growth but also take away opportunities from Americans trying to get back into the labor force. It begs the question – does anyone in this administration, including the president himself, still care about American workers who have been hit hard by mass immigration? Every word out of the president’s mouth lately seems to be that we need more foreign workers, yet one of this administration’s very first initiatives was to “Buy American, Hire American.” How ironic. An improving economy with thousands of new jobs can tighten the labor market, increase wages, and put Americans back to work. We’ve waited a long time for the stars to align, yet this opportunity is being squandered by influential business interests and negative forces within the administration, addicted to cheap foreign labor. This cycle of growth and subsequent flooding of the labor market has to stop. It is antithetical to the goal, promised to us by the Trump administration, of putting Americans first.

Numbers USA also slammed the gift to business:

DHS announces it will make 30,000 *more* H-2B guest workers available. Is this what @realDonaldTrump means by putting American workers first?

https://t.co/QEY3funQUi — NumbersUSA (@NumbersUSA) March 29, 2019

The infusion of new labor will allow companies to complete more seasonal contracts for landscaping, resort, foresty, stabling horses, and other work such as the supply of crabmeat from the Chesapeake Bay. The crabmeat business is important for the H-2B industry, partly because it is used to persuade crab-eating, D.C.-based, white-collar journalists that the H-2B program is vital for business.

Companies say they often pay good wages to their imported H-2B workers, often around $15 per hour. But that price is below the wages sought by Americans for the seasonal work which leaves them jobless in the off-season. The lower wages paid to H-2Bs also allows companies to pay lower wages to their American supervisors.

Many legislators, such as North Carolina GOP Sen. Thom Tillis, loudly or quietly, support the program partly because many companies have built their business around the promise of government-supplied labor.

But the DHS allocates H-2B workers via a process of lobbying, lawyers, and lotteries — not by market prices.

For example, many competing companies sign contracts for seasonal work and then ask the government for a suitable number of H-2B laborers. When Company A gets more H-2B laborers than Company B, it gets to complete more season work and establish a commercial advantage over Company B and other nearby companies who get fewer H-2Bs.

This flawed process forces many companies to lobby for a share of the H-2B foreign workers instead of painfully changing, curbing, and automating their business practices to match the cost of hiring Americans for seasonal work. This competitive chase for H-2B workers also ensures many companies quickly become dependent on the program — and can plausibly claim that they will go out of business unless they keep getting H-2B workers.

This allocation process also does little to deter corruption and poor treatment of H-2B workers or the rejection of Americans who lose jobs in rural communities to imported H-2Bs.

The companies, especially the landscaping industry, have repeatedly blocked reform proposals, including calls for the H-2B visas to be allocated to the companies that offer to pay the highest salaries. That reform would penalize companies that try to import cheap H-2B instead of hiring Americans at the market rate for seasonal work.

The H-2A program is just one of many visa programs that are used to suppress Americans’ salaries and wages while aiding CEOs and investors.

For example, the government awarded visas for 242,762 H-2A farm laborers in 2018, up from 200,049 visas in 2017 and 165,741 visas in 2016. That is a 45 percent rise in three years — although it is offset by a claimed reduction in illegal immigrant farm workers.

But there are far more white-collar visa workers in the United States, ensuring a greater impact on white-collar wages. In 2018, there were are at least 1.5 million white-collar visa workers in the United States, including roughly one million graduates with H-1Bs visas, roughly 400,000 OPT and CPT white-collar workers, 100,000 H4EAD workers, perhaps 100,000 workers with TN visas, at least 200,000 people with L-1 visas, plus additional populations with 0-1, E-3, J-1, or B-1 visas.

The is a huge population that is roughly twice as many workers as the 800,000 Americans who graduate with skilled technical degrees from universities each year

Also, the 1.5 million estimate does not include visa workers who have stayed beyond their visa terms and use faked work permits to keep white-collar jobs.

The army of white-collar visa workers may have helped to keep salary growth for white-collar Americans at just two percent in 2018.

Many polls show the public opposes guest workers as a threat to their salaries and jobs. An August 2017 poll reported that 68 percent of Americans oppose companies’ use of white-collar H-1Bs visas to outsource U.S.-based jobs that could be held by American graduates. More than one million foreign college graduates now hold visa jobs in the United States.

Today is a day that will go down in history of one of Britain’s finest hours: Brexit Day.

Well that was the plan, at any rate.

March 29th was a date which quickened the pulses of every Brexiteer. It was the one we’d marked in our diaries for all the amazing parties we planned to throw to celebrate our newfound independence from the European superstate; the moment when — to borrow the phrase of Brexiteer Dan Hannan — we finally managed to unshackle ourselves from the corpse.

That’s because under the terms voted for by parliament, March 29th was officially the date when the June 2016 referendum vote would be honoured and Britain would formally leave the European Union.

But guess what…

We’re not leaving, after all.

God knows what’s going to happen next. I certainly don’t. Anyone who pretends he does is deluded.

What I can tell you is this: the people who voted for Brexit aren’t going to go away and they haven’t changed their mind. On the contrary, I believe people’s appetite for Brexit is stronger than it has ever been.

One of the things that pleasantly surprised me at today’s Brexit rally outside the Houses of Parliament in London was the number of people I’d met who had originally voted Remain but were now ardent Brexiteers.

Some had originally bought into the Project Fear myths of the Establishment-driven Remain campaign; others had simply gone along with Remain thinking that a rift with the EU would be too disruptive. Now they’d just had enough of the European Union and wanted out.

The other thing that pleasantly surprised me about the rally was the overwhelming sense of optimism. It helped, no doubt, that the weather was lovely – arranged, of course, by God who is an ardent Brexiteer and despises the European Union which is why he populated its upper ranks with slithy creatures like Jean-Claude Juncker and Guy Verhofstadt and the sinister Martin Selmayr.

‘Betrayal’, ‘May’s Deal Is Not Brexit At All’: Brexiteers React to the Day Britain Should Have Left the EU https://t.co/SX2df71aHn — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 29, 2019

Everyone there was blithely confident that Brexit is going to happen one day regardless of what the political class might attempt to do to prevent it.

You could call this naivety. And from the perspective of the political class – and most of the commentators and think tankers who hang out with the political class like victims of Stockholm syndrome – I’m sure that it is.

After all, most experts have been telling us that accepting Theresa May’s glitter-dipped turd of a Withdrawal Agreement was the last chance of getting even a semblance of Brexit – and that from now on all we can hope for is ever more watered down versions thereof.

The error of this official Westminster-sanctioned point of view, it seems to me, is that we’re already in terrain where the old rules no longer apply.

Rather, we’re in the realm of chaos where no one knows anything and where anything could happen, including the radical transformation of Britain’s political system in a way that has not been seen in generations, or indeed in centuries.

Britain doesn’t have a written constitution but it does have longstanding parliamentary traditions which have been celebrated and respected across the world as that of a mature and wise and just democracy.

BREAKING: May's loses Brexit 'deal' vote 286-344 https://t.co/JLvmeuKJoZ — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 29, 2019

But if the demos no longer believe that that democracy is doing the job it is supposed to, if they’ve completely lost their faith in the system’s ability to represent their interests justly, then surely all bets are off.

Britain doesn’t really do revolutions. We’re not like the French. But that doesn’t mean there haven’t been occasions in our history when we’ve said “enough is enough” and challenged what we see as the arbitrary power of an overweening and unchecked state. Magna Carta; the Civil War…

I don’t think we’re heading for extreme violence or anything like that. But I do think very much that the impulse that led 17.4 million people to vote for Brexit is going to get stronger and stronger – and that if the political class doesn’t want to have a very miserable time then it really needs to recognise this fact sooner rather than later.

If I were an insurgent politician like Nigel Farage, I’d feel very happy right now. These are very interesting times and they’re going to get a lot more interesting still.

President Trump’s National Security Advisor John Bolton has offered some words of assurances to the British people on the day the UK was supposed to leave the European Union, saying the United States is eager to do a bilateral trade deal and the UK remains at “top of the queue.”

“People who worry about the UK ‘crashing out’ of the European Union — that’s the phrase they use — they’re going to ‘crash’ right into the United States,” Mr Bolton told Sky News’s Cordelia Lynch from the White House on Friday.

“We’re standing here waiting to make a trade deal with a United Kingdom independent of the European Union,” Mr Bolton continued, in an optimistic note.

“I don’t want to get into the specifics of what’s been going on in the House of Commons, but I can say unequivocally President Trump is eager for the will of the British people to be carried out and he is even more eager to do a trade deal,” he said.

At the time of the historic 2016 vote, and since, President Donald Trump has been a supporter of Brexit and the prospect of a strong U.S.-UK bilateral trade deal.

Prime Minister Theresa May lost her third vote on her EU-approved Withdrawal Agreement from the bloc, today, on the day the country was scheduled to leave the European Union.

Remainer forces within the House of Commons that want to stay as closely aligned to the EU as possible continue to press for May’s deal, but with an added Customs Union — where the UK would maintain the same tariffs and trade policies as the EU — which would threaten a UK-U.S. bilateral deal.

“The President wants to deal with a Britain that can change some of the rules on trade we think disfavours the United States when it’s in connection with the European Union,” Mr Bolton said on the issue of the obstructive Customs Union.

“Honestly, from the U.S. point of view — and for that matter, the UK point of view — I don’t understand why you would want to get out of the EU and not be able to set your own rules.

“That’s what independence means and that’s what the President wants to do. He think that the EU rules discriminate against American trade, and he wants a free, fare, and reciprocal trade with Great Britain.”

“But it really is quite important for the President for the people of Britain to know that this is the top of the priority. This is not the Obama administration where Britain would go ‘to the back of the queue’ — which, of course, is not an American phrase. Britain will be at the top of the queue for us.”

Asked whether he agreed with Nigel Farage whether today was a “day of shame,” the diplomat said, “I think Britain had a referendum, the Leave vote won in what everybody agrees was a free and fair election; doesn’t the will of the British people get to be carried out?”

According to U.S. defense officials quoted by the Washington Free Beacon on Wednesday, China is developing a long-range cruise missile that can be hidden inside shipping containers and launched from civilian freighters, a type of ship China happens to own in abundance.

The missile is described as the land-attack version of a high-end anti-ship missile called the YJ-18C. This Chinese anti-ship missile is, in turn, a variation of a Russian system that could be disguised as a shipping container.

As the Free Beacon pointed out, the idea of turning cargo ships into missile launch platforms is not new, but it is especially worrisome in China’s case given its aggressive posture, the huge number of container ships it has access to, and its enthusiasm for buying up civilian port facilities as part of the Belt and Road trade and infrastructure initiative. Weapons disguised as shipping containers could be launched from civilian ports at military facilities, and could remain undiscovered for a very long time in storage.

“China operates or is building deep water ports in several strategic locations, including Bahamas, Panama, and Jamaica that could be used covertly to deploy ships carrying the YJ-18C,” the Free Beacon noted.

Analysts also feared China might pass its shipping-container missiles along to rogue-state clients such as North Korea and Iran.

Several of the experts quoted by the Free Beacon mentioned the possibility that the relatively short-range container-launched cruise missiles could be fitted with electromagnetic pulse (EMP) warheads, giving them the ability to disrupt electronic equipment and electric power within a few hundred miles of civilian ports and shipping lanes.

China and its all-weather ally Pakistan are reportedly furious with the United States for pushing a draft resolution this week to outlaw the Pakistani leader of an anti-India, U.S.-designated terrorist group directly to the United Nations Security Council, bypassing established procedures.

Voice of America (VOA) reports:

Washington circulated the resolution to the 15-member council on Wednesday with the support of France and Britain to designate Masood Azhar, the head of Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), a global terrorist. The move came two weeks after Beijing blocked a similar U.S.-sponsored resolution at the U.N. anti-terrorism “1267 sanctions committee”, which China insists is the authorized U.N. body to deal by consensus with the listing issues.

Responding to the recent U.S. move, Geng Shuang, a spokesman for China’s foreign ministry, reportedly urged the United States to “act cautiously” and avoid “forcefully” pushing the draft resolution.

“This is not in line with [the] resolution of the issue through dialogue and negotiations. This has reduced the authority of the committee as a main anti-terrorism body of the UNSC, and this is not conducive to the solidarity and only complicates the issue,” Geng added.

Pakistan also rebuked America’s new effort to label the JeM chief a global terrorist once and for all.

Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Faisal recently told reporters:

Such efforts to circumvent the established machinery for this purpose will only weaken the 1267 regime. …Any action outside the committee will undermine the integrity of the sanctions regime and must be avoided. Pakistan remains committed to [fulfilling] its obligations under the U.N. sanctions committee.

Beijing and Islamabad have repeatedly blocked U.S.-led efforts, backed by Pakistan’s regional rival India, to declare the JeM chief a global terrorist.

China prevented the U.N. committee from sanctioning the JeM chief in 2016, 2017, and again this year.

JeM claimed responsibility for the deadly February 14 attack in the Indian-held portion of the disputed Muslim-majority Kashmir region, which drove nuclear-armed India and Pakistan to the brink of another war.

However, Islamabad has asked New Delhi to provide more evidence on the group’s involvement in the suicide assault, which left over 40 Indian forces dead, marking one of the deadliest attacks in the region.

“India on Thursday expressed disappointment over Pakistan’s response to its dossier on Jaish-e-Mohammed’s involvement in the dastardly Pulwama attack [in Indian-held Kashmir], saying Islamabad continues to be in ‘denial’ on the issue of cross border terrorism, the Press Trust of Indian (PTI) notes.

India and Pakistan have already fought two major wars and a minor conflict over Kashmir, home to competing claims for territory by Beijing, its ally Islamabad, and mutual rival New Delhi.

On numerous occasions, U.S., Indian, and Afghan officials have accused Pakistan of harboring terrorist groups like JeM, an assertion that Islamabad and Beijing continue to deny.

China and Pakistan are closed military and financial allies. While Pakistan refuses to condemn the reported mistreatment of Muslims in China’s Xinjiang province, Beijing has repeatedly defended Islamabad against accusations of serving as a sanctuary for terrorists.

According to the U.S. government, China faces a terrorist threat from jihadis training and operating in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region, which houses the highest concentration of terrorist groups in the world.

China’s Muslim-majority Xinjiang province borders Pakistan-held Kashmir.

Beijing tends to stay in the shadows of Kashmir-linked military disputes between Pakistan and India, usually backing Islamabad’s position.

Pakistan has ceded control of some of its Kashmir territories to China. Meanwhile, India contests China’s claims to land that sits on the portion of Kashmir it controls.

Beijing urged restraint by India and Pakistan during the recent tensions in Kashmir that resulted in reciprocal air operations by both countries, including a brief dogfight.

“The tensions [in Kashmir] cooled down due to diplomatic interventions by major powers such as the United States, China, Russia, and regional allies, particularly Saudi Arabia,” VOA notes.

Early this month, the U.S. military credited Pakistan with taking action against terrorist groups operating on its soil in recent weeks.

“But India, and even some critics at home, remain skeptical of Pakistan’s counter-terrorism efforts, saying some of the groups, including JeM, allegedly are backed by the country’s military and previous pledges to dismantle these organizations did not produce the desired results,” VOA points out.

Referring to evidence India recently provided to Pakistan highlighting JeM’s involvement in the deadly Kashmir attack, Raveesh Kumar, a spokesperson for New Delhi’s external affairs ministry, said this week, according to PTI.

Harold Thomas Martin III entered a guilty plea at U.S. District Court in Baltimore on Thursday, admitting his role in what could be the worst breach of classified data in U.S. history.

The severity of the breach is measured in terms of how much information Martin looted from the systems he had access to. Fortunately, he does not appear to have done anything with the data he took. His defense lawyers characterized him as a data hoarder, a victim of compulsive mental illness who piled up classified files and sensitive documents the way other hoarders accumulate newspapers or clothes.

After Martin was arrested in 2016, there was speculation he might have been a “whistleblower” in the Edward Snowden mode who lost his nerve, or he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder after his deployment in Operation Desert Storm. Suspicions have been raised that he worked with or inspired the “Shadow Brokers,” an infamous hacker group that exposed some of the powerful software tools the National Security Agency (NSA) used for penetrating foreign computer systems.

As is perhaps inevitable with any case touching upon the shadowy world of cyber espionage, there are many theories about his alarming behavior and the curiously low-key processing of his case – which began with a huge FBI raid compared by eyewitnesses to a military invasion but has received little media attention since.

Martin wound up sitting on about 50 terabytes of data that never should have left the offices he took it from, a hoard prosecutors described as “breathtaking” in scope but rather sloppy in execution, as some of the pilfered material was reportedly stuffed into his car and an unlocked shed in his backyard. The NSA document he pled guilty to stealing is evidently one of the items he left in his car.

Martin stole about 300 times as much information as Snowden, including top-shelf secret spy software and information that could have compromised American agents on dangerous assignments. His data-hoarding career spanned two decades of work for government contractors, including the same one that employed Snowden, Booz Allen Hamilton.

Martin was originally charged with 20 counts of espionage but admitted to one count of “willful retention of national defense information,” for which the 54-year-old could serve up to nine years in prison. The two and a half years he has already been in custody will reportedly be credited against his sentence.

The Georgia House gave its final approval Friday to legislation that will ban abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected.

The bill passed 92–78, with 91 needed for approval, and it now heads to Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, who said he will sign it into law.

Georgia values life. We stand up for the innocent and speak for those who cannot speak for themselves. The legislature’s bold action reaffirms our priorities and who we are as a state. I thank these lawmakers for their leadership and applaud their undeniable courage. #gapol — Brian Kemp (@BrianKempGA) March 29, 2019

“Georgia values life,” Kemp tweeted after the vote. “We stand up for the innocent and speak for those who cannot speak for themselves.”

“The legislature’s bold action reaffirms our priorities and who we are as a state,” he added. “I thank these lawmakers for their leadership and applaud their undeniable courage.”

Kemp said the “efforts to protect life do not end here,” as he promoted an easing of “the adoption process,” a search for “loving homes for those in foster care,” and protection for “the aging & vulnerable.”

Our efforts to protect life do not end here. We must work to ease the adoption process, find loving homes for those in foster care, protect the aging & vulnerable. Together, we will ensure that all Georgians are safe & have the opportunity to live, grow, learn, & prosper. #gapol — Brian Kemp (@BrianKempGA) March 29, 2019

State Rep. Ed Setzler, who sponsored House Bill 481, said the legislation is something that “commonsense Georgians” should be proud of, reported the Atlanta-Journal Constitution.

“This bill recognizes the fundamental life of the child in the womb is worthy of legal protection and balances that basic right to life with the very different situations women find themselves in in pregnancies,” he said.

In an exclusive comment to Breitbart News, Concerned Women for America (CWA) of Georgia representative Jane Robbins said the legislation is “the most historic pro-life legislation passed in Georgia since Roe v. Wade.”

“The legislators faced withering pressure from pro-abortion forces, including the predictable outrage from Hollywood, but by and large they held firm to their principles,” she added. “CWA is very grateful to all the Georgia leaders who helped get this bill over the finish line.”

Democrat State Rep. Vernon Jones said the approval of the bill could cause Republicans to lose power in the State House.

“If your members vote for this bill in 2020, your party loses,” Jones said. “There’s going to be a new speaker of the House here. If there’s a new speaker, many in your party will lose power, all of you will lose your chairmanships. If you all lose based on this bill, this body is going to change over.”

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Georgia has already announced it will bring a lawsuit to challenge the legislation.

“If Governor Kemp signs this abortion ban bill into law, the ACLU has one message: We will see you in court,” said Andrea Young, executive director.

Planned Parenthood also condemned the legislation, tweeting, “To the politicians in Georgia and everywhere who are after our rights, we see through your lies.”

In addition to pro-life lawmakers’ ability to withstand protests by the “Handmaids” abortion-rights supporters, most recently, a group of Hollywood writers and elite celebrities, spearheaded by actress Alyssa Milano, threatened to boycott the state if the “heartbeat” abortion ban passed:

To @BrianKempGA & Speaker Ralston:

In a letter, signed by celebrities such as Alec Baldwin and Sarah Silverman, the actors threatened Georgia lawmakers:

We can’t imagine being elected officials who had to say to their constituents, “I enacted a law that was so evil, it chased billions of dollars out of our state’s economy.” It’s not the most effective campaign slogan, but rest assured we’ll make it yours should it come to pass.

The celebrities threatened to move their film and television industry to “a safer state for women if H.B. 481 becomes law.”


The Georgia House gave its final approval Friday to legislation that will ban abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected.

The bill passed 92–78, with 91 needed for approval, and it now heads to Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, who said he will sign it into law.

Georgia values life. We stand up for the innocent and speak for those who cannot speak for themselves. The legislature’s bold action reaffirms our priorities and who we are as a state. I thank these lawmakers for their leadership and applaud their undeniable courage. #gapol — Brian Kemp (@BrianKempGA) March 29, 2019

“Georgia values life,” Kemp tweeted after the vote. “We stand up for the innocent and speak for those who cannot speak for themselves.”

“The legislature’s bold action reaffirms our priorities and who we are as a state,” he added. “I thank these lawmakers for their leadership and applaud their undeniable courage.”

Kemp said the “efforts to protect life do not end here,” as he promoted an easing of “the adoption process,” a search for “loving homes for those in foster care,” and protection for “the aging & vulnerable.”

Our efforts to protect life do not end here. We must work to ease the adoption process, find loving homes for those in foster care, protect the aging & vulnerable. Together, we will ensure that all Georgians are safe & have the opportunity to live, grow, learn, & prosper. #gapol — Brian Kemp (@BrianKempGA) March 29, 2019

State Rep. Ed Setzler, who sponsored House Bill 481, said the legislation is something that “commonsense Georgians” should be proud of, reported the Atlanta-Journal Constitution.

“This bill recognizes the fundamental life of the child in the womb is worthy of legal protection and balances that basic right to life with the very different situations women find themselves in in pregnancies,” he said.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said Thursday he plans to investigate whether the San Antonio City Council violated the First Amendment when it banned Chick-fil-A from participating as a vendor at the city’s airport because of the restaurant’s support for Christian values:

The City of San Antonio’s decision to exclude Chick-fil-A based on the religious beliefs associated with the company and its owners is the opposite of tolerance. It’s discriminatory, and not only out of step with Texas values, but inconsistent with the Constitution and Texas law. pic.twitter.com/iOk7G9Eltv — Ken Paxton (@KenPaxtonTX) March 28, 2019

Gov. Greg Abbott tweeted the Chick-fil-A ban “has the stench of religious discrimination”:

Texas Sen. Ted Cruz also tweeted about the ban, “The Texas attorney general says it’s ‘discriminatory’”:

Roberto Treviño, San Antonio District 1 City Councilman, moved last week to ban the privately held, family-owned business from its list of airport vendors. Six council members approved the motion to ban Chick-fil-A, while four voted against it.

“With this decision, the City Council reaffirmed the work our city has done to become a champion of equality and inclusion,” Treviño said, according to NBC News 4. “San Antonio is a city full of compassion, and we do not have room in our public facilities for a business with a legacy of anti-LGBTQ behavior.”

However, Texas Rep. Chip Roy tweeted a letter he sent to the San Antonio City Council in which he reacted to Treviño’s comment:

Targeting individuals, organizations, or corporations for carrying out their deeply held religious beliefs in accord with our laws and consistent with many Americans’ similarly held religious beliefs is hardly making San Antonio a champion of ‘equality and inclusion.’”

“The Constitution’s protection of religious liberty is somehow even better than Chick-fil-A’s chicken,” Paxton wrote in a letter to San Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg and the rest of the council, reported Chron.com. “Unfortunately, I have serious concerns that both are under assault at the San Antonio airport.”

Chron.com continued:

Paxton also on Thursday asked Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao to look into whether the city broke any federal law or regulation as a recipient of federal grant funds. In a letter to Chao, Paxton said the city’s action could violate the free exercise clause of the First Amendment. He added that it also could violate federal statutes and regulations that prohibit discrimination on the basis of creed. “Ironically, the city’s efforts to be ‘inclusive’ resulted in the exclusion of Chick-fil-A based on its religious beliefs,” Paxton wrote to Chao.

The news report noted as well that Councilman Greg Brockhouse, who is running for mayor against Nirenberg, responded to Paxton’s announcement about his investigation by calling on the City Council to reconsider its decision.

“This investigation is the result of the City Council’s horrible decision to punish Chick-fil-A for their constitutionally protected rights to freedom of religion,” Brockhouse said. “The City Council must immediately reconvene on this item … to consider revoking this vote moving forward with Chick-fil-A as part of the contract.”

Breitbart News reported on Treviño’s motion to ban Chick-fil-A:

Chick-fil-A was initially set to be one of the airport’s restaurant offerings, but the councilman’s motion came on the heels of a report by extremist organization Think Progress that highlighted the $1.8 million in donations to Christian groups that Chick-fil-A reported to its shareholders. “Everyone has a place here, and everyone should feel welcome when they walk through our airport,” Treviño added. “I look forward to the announcement of a suitable replacement.”

Chick-fil-A states on its website that the company continues to uphold the biblical principles that guided the founding of its business by S. Truett Cathy. The company has given financial support to Christian youth organizations and charitable groups, such as the Salvation Army.

Chick-fil-A continues:

While some have questioned the motives behind our donations, we want to take a moment to reiterate the mission and focus of the Chick-fil-A Foundation, which has always been and always will be to donate to programs that support a diverse array of youth and educational programs nationwide. The 140,000 people who serve customers on a daily basis represent and embrace all people, regardless of race, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation or gender identity.

According to the restaurant’s website, in 2018, Chick-fil-A was presented with a Glassdoor Employees’ Choice Award for being among the top 100 best places to work. Additionally, Chick-fil-A was included in Glassdoor’s Top 100 CEOs.

Also, in 2018, Chick-fil-A was recognized for customer experience in the Temkin Experience Ratings survey, and was named “Best Franchise Brand” by Airport Revenue News.

Chick-fil-A was included as well in 2018 in Forbes’ list of best employers and as a National Society of High School Scholars top employer.

Friday on “Fox & Friends,” House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) responded to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi calling House Republicans “scaredy-cats” for wanting Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) to resign from his position as House Intelligence chairman because he pushed the Russia collusion narrative.

“I think a lot of Pelosi’s poodles out there [are] running scared of the facts, but they’re still trying to chase down witch hunts,” Scalise said. “If that’s what they want to be — the party of just constant harassment of the president, of his family, of allowing babies who were born to be killed when they are outside of the womb. That’s what they’ve become. It’s radical.”

Scalise said Democrats have been “peddling” the “lie” of collusion for two years and will not stop trying to undermine President Donald Trump’s presidency.

“They will never admit they were wrong,” he advised. “They just move on and make some other baseless accusation.”

Members of the Kardashian and Jenner family are thanking the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency for arresting an illegal alien who has twice broken into Kendall Jenner’s home.

“We are extremely appreciative of the hard work by the Los Angeles Police Department and ICE, whose swift response and professionalism led to this man’s apprehension. His actions have not only had a severe impact on Kendall’s life but the entire family’s sense of security, causing us to fear for Kendall’s safety as well as our own,” the family said in a statement to the press.

“Knowing this individual is in custody gives us peace of mind,” the joint message from the Kardashian and Jenner families concluded.

The statement came on the heels of the arrest of John Ford, 38, a Canadian who was convicted twice of breaking into 23-year-old model Kendall Jenner’s Los Angeles home.

ICE apprehended him in a hotel parking lot in Albuquerque, New Mexico, several days ago. Ford was apprehended twice before at Jenner’s home in the Mulholland Estates gated community of Los Angeles. In October of last year, he was caught sneaking around by Jenner’s pool.

Ford was convicted on charges of misdemeanor trespassing.

Jack P. Staton, special agent in charge of El Paso office of ICE’s Homeland Security Operations, said in a statement that Ford’s arrest may have “prevented a violent crime.”

“Our special agents acted quickly on this tip to ensure that this obsessive behavior didn’t escalate to become a tragedy,” Staton said.

“Following his arrest,” ICE reported, “Ford was processed and served with a notice to appear (NTA) before a federal immigration judge; he remains in ICE custody in El Paso, Texas, awaiting disposition of his immigration case.”

President Donald Trump is threatening to close parts of the U.S.-Mexican border as record numbers of migrants surge through the legal loopholes created by Congress and judges.

“CONGRESS MUST CHANGE OUR WEAK IMMIGRATION LAWS NOW … If Mexico doesn’t immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States throug [sic] our Southern Border, I will be CLOSING….. ….the Border, or large sections of the Border, next week,” he said in a series of three tweets Friday morning.

The DEMOCRATS have given us the weakest immigration laws anywhere in the World. Mexico has the strongest, & they make more than $100 Billion a year on the U.S. Therefore, CONGRESS MUST CHANGE OUR WEAK IMMIGRATION LAWS NOW, & Mexico must stop illegals from entering the U.S…. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2019

….through their country and our Southern Border. Mexico has for many years made a fortune off of the U.S., far greater than Border Costs. If Mexico doesn’t immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States throug our Southern Border, I will be CLOSING….. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2019

….the Border, or large sections of the Border, next week. This would be so easy for Mexico to do, but they just take our money and “talk.” Besides, we lose so much money with them, especially when you add in drug trafficking etc.), that the Border closing would be a good thing! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2019

Border officials are ramping up their estimates for the number of migrants who will grab the opportunity created by Congress. Predictions for 2019 have climbed from 900,000 to 1.2 million during the last few weeks.

Others experts suggest the 2019 number may be far larger. A February report from Jim Clifton, the chairman, and CEO at Gallup said:

Forty-two million seekers of citizenship or asylum are watching to determine exactly when and how is the best time to make the move. This suggests that open borders could potentially attract 42 million Latin Americans. A full 5 million who are planning to move in the next 12 months say they are moving to the U.S.

Pro-migration activists pretend migrants are helpless recipients of progressive charity. But migrants are rational & will go to US if Dems & biz force open the border. So Gallup warns that 5 million people are calculating the gains & risks for a 2019 move: https://t.co/nGUr3Q0dXk — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) February 10, 2019

Pro-migration Democrats deny the migrant wave and say it is smaller than the surges seen under President George W. Bush. But the numbers under Bush were high because individual migrants were overcounted as they made repeated attempts to sneak through the border. The current count excludes overcounts because each migrant is counted once before they are released into the United States to move into blue-collar jobs, neighborhoods, and schools.

The growing wave of migrants from Central America is being welcomed as a “humanitarian crisis” by most Democrats leaders because it provides them with a new bloc of ‘dreamer’ illegals who may become voters in the 2030s. The surge is also welcomed because it gives elite progressives an opportunity to simultaneously display favoritism to subordinate outsiders and disdain towards the mass of ordinary Americans who demand respect, civic solidarity, and higher wages.

Business interests welcome the migration because it provides a new block of cheap workers, consumers, and renters, and also because it helps distract Washington from Trump’s “Hire American” policy and his “Four Pillars” immigration reforms. The “Hire American” policy opposed by business groups because it is giving Trump’s voters important pay raises before the 2020 elections.

Business interests will rally to block Trump’s threat to shutter the border until Mexico helps stop the mass migration, which is being aided by new bus lines which ferry migrants up to the U.S. border.

Trump’s statement comes as border official are trying to warn Congress of the problems.

For example, DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said in a Thursday letter to all members of Congress that, “We face a system-wide meltdown … We are witnessing the real-time dissolution of the immigration system.”

She added, “I will be working with the Office of Management and Budget to provide you additional details in the near future, but the situation is so dire we want to make notification to you now that we will require additional resources … to ensure immediate safety and care of individuals in our custody.”

On Monday, border commissioner Kevin McAleenan provided reporters with some details about the Central Americans’ rush into Americans’ society, jobs, and schools. The March inflow alone will include roughly 15,000 parents and 40,000 children in “family units” who will ask for asylum — and then will be released — plus roughly 35,000 single adults who will try to evade border officers, he said.

McAleenan pinned the blame on Congress and the judges who have jointly cut legal holes in the border fences by allowing migrants to stream into U.S. cities, jobs, and schools if they merely ask for asylum, saying:

The increase in family units is a direct response to the vulnerabilities in our legal frameworks where migrants and smugglers know that they will be released and be allowed to stay in the U.S. indefinitely pending immigration proceedings that could be many years out. This is due to court orders that undermine the integrity of our immigration system. There is no questioning [about] why this is happening.

DHS Nielsen: "We are witnessing the real-time dissolution of the immigration system.” GOP: 'Yeah, but donors need more labor, consumers & renters.' Dems: 'Whatevs, we're getting 2032 voters.' Media; 'We're sharing feels with grateful migrants.' Voters: TBD https://t.co/aJuus1JFhj — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) March 29, 2019

Each year, roughly four million young Americans join the workforce after high school or university. The federal government then imports roughly 1.1 million legal immigrants, refreshes a resident population of roughly 1.5 million white-collar guest workers and roughly 500,000 blue-collar visa workers, and it also tolerates about eight million illegal workers.

In 2019 — because of catch-and-release rules mandated by Congress and the courts — the federal government also will likely release at least 350,000 migrant Central American laborers into the U.S. job market even as at least 500,000 more migrants sneak past U.S. border defenses or overstay their visas.

This federal policy of using legal and illegal migration to boost economic growth for investors shifts enormous wealth from young employees towards older investors by flooding the market with cheap white-collar graduates and blue-collar foreign labor.

This cheap labor economic policy forces Americans to compete even for low wage jobs, it widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids’ schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines millions of marginalized Americans, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.

But Trump’s “Hire American” policy has crimped the supply of new workers, so allowing blue-collar Americans to get a four percent wage increase in 2018.

Border officials are ramping up their estimates for the number of migrants who will grab the opportunity created by Congress. Predictions for 2019 have climbed from 900,000 to 1.2 million during the last few weeks.

Others experts suggest the 2019 number may be far larger. A February report from Jim Clifton, the chairman, and CEO at Gallup said:

Forty-two million seekers of citizenship or asylum are watching to determine exactly when and how is the best time to make the move. This suggests that open borders could potentially attract 42 million Latin Americans. A full 5 million who are planning to move in the next 12 months say they are moving to the U.S.

Pro-migration activists pretend migrants are helpless recipients of progressive charity. But migrants are rational & will go to US if Dems & biz force open the border. So Gallup warns that 5 million people are calculating the gains & risks for a 2019 move: https://t.co/nGUr3Q0dXk — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) February 10, 2019

Pro-migration Democrats deny the migrant wave and say it is smaller than the surges seen under President George W. Bush. But the numbers under Bush were high because individual migrants were overcounted as they made repeated attempts to sneak through the border. The current count excludes overcounts because each migrant is counted once before they are released into the United States to move into blue-collar jobs, neighborhoods, and schools.

The growing wave of migrants from Central America is being welcomed as a “humanitarian crisis” by most Democrats leaders because it provides them with a new bloc of ‘dreamer’ illegals who may become voters in the 2030s. The surge is also welcomed because it gives elite progressives an opportunity to simultaneously display favoritism to subordinate outsiders and disdain towards the mass of ordinary Americans who demand respect, civic solidarity, and higher wages.

Business interests welcome the migration because it provides a new block of cheap workers, consumers, and renters, and also because it helps distract Washington from Trump’s “Hire American” policy and his “Four Pillars” immigration reforms. The “Hire American” policy opposed by business groups because it is giving Trump’s voters important pay raises before the 2020 elections.

Business interests will rally to block Trump’s threat to shutter the border until Mexico helps stop the mass migration, which is being aided by new bus lines which ferry migrants up to the U.S. border.

Trump’s statement comes as border official are trying to warn Congress of the problems.

For example, DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said in a Thursday letter to all members of Congress that, “We face a system-wide meltdown … We are witnessing the real-time dissolution of the immigration system.”

She added, “I will be working with the Office of Management and Budget to provide you additional details in the near future, but the situation is so dire we want to make notification to you now that we will require additional resources … to ensure immediate safety and care of individuals in our custody.”

On Monday, border commissioner Kevin McAleenan provided reporters with some details about the Central Americans’ rush into Americans’ society, jobs, and schools. The March inflow alone will include roughly 15,000 parents and 40,000 children in “family units” who will ask for asylum — and then will be released — plus roughly 35,000 single adults who will try to evade border officers, he said.

McAleenan pinned the blame on Congress and the judges who have jointly cut legal holes in the border fences by allowing migrants to stream into U.S. cities, jobs, and schools if they merely ask for asylum, saying:

The increase in family units is a direct response to the vulnerabilities in our legal frameworks where migrants and smugglers know that they will be released and be allowed to stay in the U.S. indefinitely pending immigration proceedings that could be many years out. This is due to court orders that undermine the integrity of our immigration system. There is no questioning [about] why this is happening.

DHS Nielsen: "We are witnessing the real-time dissolution of the immigration system.” GOP: 'Yeah, but donors need more labor, consumers & renters.' Dems: 'Whatevs, we're getting 2032 voters.' Media; 'We're sharing feels with grateful migrants.' Voters: TBD https://t.co/aJuus1JFhj — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) March 29, 2019

Each year, roughly four million young Americans join the workforce after high school or university. The federal government then imports roughly 1.1 million legal immigrants, refreshes a resident population of roughly 1.5 million white-collar guest workers and roughly 500,000 blue-collar visa workers, and it also tolerates about eight million illegal workers.

In 2019 — because of catch-and-release rules mandated by Congress and the courts — the federal government also will likely release at least 350,000 migrant Central American laborers into the U.S. job market even as at least 500,000 more migrants sneak past U.S. border defenses or overstay their visas.

This federal policy of using legal and illegal migration to boost economic growth for investors shifts enormous wealth from young employees towards older investors by flooding the market with cheap white-collar graduates and blue-collar foreign labor.

This cheap labor economic policy forces Americans to compete even for low wage jobs, it widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids’ schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines millions of marginalized Americans, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.

But Trump’s “Hire American” policy has crimped the supply of new workers, so allowing blue-collar Americans to get a four percent wage increase in 2018.


President Donald Trump again threatened Friday to close the Southern border as soon as next week if Mexico did not do more to stop caravans of migrants from traveling to the United States.

“Mexico is tough. They can stop them. But they chose not to,” Trump said. “Now they got to stop them. If they don’t stop them, we’re closing the border. We’ll close it and we’ll keep it closed for a long time, I’m not playing games.”

The president pointed to two large caravans coming up to the Southern border through Mexico from Guatemala.

“They have to grab it and they have to stop it,” Trump referring to Mexico leaders.

He said that the United States immigration laws were “the weakest, the most pathetic laws” and demanded that Mexico to use their tougher laws to stop the caravans.

“There’s a very good likelihood that I’ll be closing the border next week and that will be just fine with me,” he said.

The president commented on the border crisis during a visit to a dike in Florida and an afternoon press conference at his club at Mar-a-Lago.

Trump acknowledged that although Mexico started to break up caravans, they had since stopped even trying.

“Mexico has to stop it. They have people coming right through Mexico. It’s a long, very dangerous journey, Mexico sends busses, they send trucks,” he said.

He also criticized countries like Honduras and Guatemala and El Salvador for “sending” their people towards the United States and said he stopped sending them money for aid.

“They set up these caravans, in many cases, they put their worst people in the caravans, they are not going to put their best in, they get rid of their problems and they march up here,” the president said.

Trump praised U.S. border officials for catching illegal immigrants at the border but acknowledged that border enforcement had “run out of space” to detain them all.

“We can’t hold people anymore and Mexico can stop it so easily, they don’t go through a court system every time somebody steps on our land, you step on our land, ‘Welcome to the United States’ it’s ridiculous,” Trump said.

Former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson on Friday weighed in on the situation at the southern border, saying the United States was “truly in a crisis.”

Johnson, who served in the Obama administration, said he was invested in the apprehension numbers as part of his job and explained how 4,000 apprehensions and encounters in one day were unimaginable.

“When I was in office in Kirstjen Nielsen’s job at her desk, I’d get to work around 6:30 in the morning and there’d be my intelligence book sitting on my desk, the PDB, and also the apprehension numbers from the day before,” Johnson revealed on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” “And I’d look at them every memory morning, it would be the first thing I’d look at, and I probably got too close to the problem.”

He continued, “[M]y staff will tell you if it was under 1,000 apprehensions the day before, that was a relatively good number. And if it was above 1,000, it was a relatively bad number, and I was going to be in a bad mood the whole day. On Tuesday, there were 4,000 apprehensions. I know that a thousand overwhelms the system. I cannot begin to imagine what 4,000 a day looks like. So we are truly in a crisis.”

The City of Chicago on Thursday warned Empire actor Jussie Smollett that he could be prosecuted for lying if he fails to repay the the six-figure cost of the Chicago Police Department’s investigation into his alleged hate hoax in the next seven days.

In a letter written by Edward Siskel, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s senior legal adviser, Smollett is accused of making “false statements,” which led law enforcement to divert “resources from other investigations and undermining the criminal justice system.”

Jussie Smollett reiterated Tuesday that he was innocent of staging a racist and homophobic attack against himself in downtown Chicago after the Cook County State’s Attorney’s surprise decision to drop 16 charges against the actor for filing a false police report on the incident. Speaking outside a Chicago courtroom, he maintained he had been “truthful and consistent on every single level since day one.”

Siskel’s letter, which was sent to the office of Smollet’s attorney, Patricia Brown Holmes, states that “Chicago police investigation revealed that [Smollett] knowingly filed a false police report and had in fact orchestrated your own attack.” Further, Smollett is requested to issue an “immediate payment of the $130,160.15 expended on overtime hours in the investigation of this matter,” to be made within one week.

The letter continues that if the actor doesn’t resolve the amount owed to the City of Chicago Corporate Counsel, he could be prosecuted by the Department of Law and slapped with a fine of up to $1,000, “plus up to three times the amount of damages the city sustains as a result of the violation.”

City officials say at least $150,000 was spent on the case.

On Tuesday, the Cook County State’s Attorney’s office announced it was dropping all charges against Smollett “after reviewing all of the facts and circumstances of the case, including Mr. Smollett’s volunteer service in the community and agreement to forfeit his bond to the City of Chicago, we believe this outcome is a just disposition and appropriate resolution to this case.”

Police charge Smollett, who is African-American and gay, paid two brothers — Abel and Ola Osundairo — to stage the January 29th attack in downtown Chicago in an attempt to boost his career. Smollett told detectives his assailants wore masks as they hurled insults, lopped a thin rope around his neck and doused him with an unknown liquid. He also said the attackers shouted “This is MAGA country,” a reference to President Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan, before fleeing the scene.

The BBC was ordered to pay damages after the far-left outlet published fake news claiming Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko “authorized” an illegal payment of $400,000 to Michael Cohen for additional face time during a June 2017 meeting with President Trump.

“We apologize to Mr. Poroshenko for any distress caused and have agreed to pay him damages, legal costs and have participated in a joint statement in open court,” the BBC’s said in a written apology published Thursday.

In the May 2018 piece, the disgraced BBC made the absurd claim that Poroshenko, who already had a meeting set up with Trump, paid this $400,000 to extend the meeting.

Think about how well this utterly deranged piece of fake news fits into the overall media’s Russia Collusion Hoax.

Poroshenko is an aggressive opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin, so naturally the only way he could get serious face time with Trump (aka Putin’s Stooge) is through a six-figure bribe. Michael Cohen was still the president’s personal lawyer at this time, which means the media were desperate for us to see Cohen as Trump’s world-traveling bagman, because that would lend credibility to the phony dossier’s lie about Cohen visiting Prague to pay off the hackers who got Hillary’s emails. The story openly insinuates Trump is both in Putin’s pocket and accepting bribes.

In a way you have to admire the slickness of it — the triple bank-shot of hysteria the BBC hoped to sink.

But it is also preposterous. Who in their right mind would believe a billionaire like Trump would risk his presidency (and prison) for a lousy $400,000, or use Cohen to arrange it?

Just as preposterous, though, is the whole idea Trump was a traitor who stole a presidential election, and we were hit with that media-lunacy 24/7 for two years.

More from the BBC:

In our News at Ten bulletin and in an online article published on May 23, 2018, we incorrectly reported that Petro Poroshenko, the President of Ukraine, had procured or authorised a corrupt payment of $400,000 to be made to Michael Cohen, the personal lawyer of Donald Trump, to extend a brief meeting between Mr. Poroshenko and President Trump, that had already been agreed, into more substantial talks.

No word yet on the amount of damages paid by the BBC, but it is good to see some justice done. The idea a news outlet can smear anyone they like, hide behind freedom of the press, and suffer no consequence is outrageous.

Let’s hope Nick Sandmann is delivered a similar form of justice very, very soon.

Poroshenko, who is running for re-election, sued the BBC over the report. Election Day is March 31.

In a recent article, TechCrunch reports that Facebook’s removal of Infowars host Alex Jones from its platform underscores the many issues the company has with content moderation.

In a recent article titled “Facebook’s handling of Alex Jones is a microcosm of its content policy problem,” TechCrunch reports that the removal of Infowars host Alex Jones from the Facebook platform is an example of the many issues that the site has with content moderation. Jones’ high profile persona meant that Facebook executives themselves had to get involved in the decision-making process.

TechCrunch writes:

To make that determination, 20 Facebook and Instagram executives hashed it out over the Jones post, which depicted a mural known as “False Profits” by the artist Mear One. Facebook began debating the post after it was flagged by Business Insider for kicking up anti semitic comments on Wednesday. The company removed 23 of 500 comments on the post that it interpreted to be in clear violation of Facebook policy. Later in the conversation, some of the UK-based Instagram and Facebook executives on the email provided more context for their US-based peers. Last year, a controversy over the same painting erupted when British politician Jeremy Corbyn argued in support of the mural’s creator after the art was removed from a wall in East London due what many believed to be antisemitic overtones. Because of that, the image and its context are likely better known in the UK, a fact that came up in Facebook’s discussion over how to handle the Jones post.

TechCrunch notes that the same image that had Jones removed from Facebook is still present across many of its platforms, posted by the artist behind the image. this demonstrates the company’s inconsistency in moderation:

Ultimately, after some back and forth, the post was removed. According to the emails, Alex Jones’ Instagram account “does not currently violate [the rules]” as “an IG account has to have at least 30% of content violating at any given time as per our regular guidelines.” That fact might prove puzzling once you know that Alex Jones got his main account booted off Facebook itself in 2018 — and the company did another sweep for Jones-linked pages last month. Whether you agree with Facebook’s content moderation decisions or not, it’s impossible to argue that they are consistently enforced. In the latest example, the company argued over a single depiction of a controversial image even as the same image is literally for sale by the artist elsewhere on both on Instagram and Facebook. (As any Facebook reporter can attest, these inconsistencies will probably be resolved shortly after this story goes live.)

TechCrunch notes that although Facebook appears to be trying to improve its content moderation, the sites inconsistent enforcement has led to further issues for the firm:

It’s clear that even as Facebook attempts to make strides, its approach to content moderation remains reactive, haphazard and probably too deeply preoccupied with public perception. Some cases of controversial content are escalated all the way to the top while others languish, undetected. Where the line is drawn isn’t particularly clear. And even when high profile violations are determined, it’s not apparent that those case studies meaningfully trickle down clarify smaller, everyday decisions by content moderators on Facebook’s lower rungs.

As always, the squeaky wheel gets the grease — but two billion users and reactive rather than proactive policy enforcement means that there’s an endless sea of ungreased wheels drifting around. This problem isn’t unique to Facebook, but given its scope, it does make the biggest case study in what can go wrong when a platform scales wildly with little regard for the consequences.

A Facebook spokesperson commented on the issue stating: “We want people to be able to express themselves freely on our platforms, but we also want to make sure that hate speech comes down. That is why we have public rules about what is and isn’t allowed on Facebook and Instagram. As this exchange shows, deciding what content stays up and who can use our platforms is one of the hardest decisions we have to make as a company and it’s sensible that we take the time to get it right.”

Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School’s pro-Second Amendment Kyle Kashuv has been accepted into Harvard.

He posted his acceptance to Instagram:

Kashuv emerged from the February 14, 2018, high school shooting a vocal proponent of the Second Amendment and an outspoken critic of the Broward County Sheriff’s Office. On March 25, 2018, he told Face the Nation that people pointing fingers regarding the shooting ought to point at the “cowards of Broward County” rather than guns.

Kashuv’s references to cowardice referenced a surveillance video that allegedly showed Broward County Deputy Scot Peterson arrive at the scene of the attack 90 seconds after it began, only to remain outside the building until the event was over and 17 people were dead.

On March 1, 2019, Breitbart News reported that Kashuv ended up on an elevator with Peterson and confronted him for not going in to stop the shooter.

The NRA cheered Kashuv’s acceptance to Harvard:

On December 22, 2018, Breitbart News reported that gun control proponent David Hogg was accepted to Harvard.

Hogg and Kashuv emerged from the Parkland shooting espousing two completely different worldviews. Hogg pushed various gun controls and student walk-outs/protests. Kashuv pushed for pro-Second Amendment ways schools could approach safety, and observed, “Walkouts don’t work. They are a waste of time and they’re counterproductive. They ruin the school system and they ruin the entire day for kids. Additionally, [a walkout] doesn’t solve anything; it doesn’t push policy.”

BOSTON (AP) — A procession of wealthy parents, from a Napa Valley vineyard owner to a Hot Pockets heiress, are appearing in court Friday to hear charges that they paid bribes to get their children into top colleges.

The 15 parents, including CEOs, investment executives, real estate developers and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, are slated to appear in Boston federal court on charges related to the nationwide college admissions cheating scheme dubbed Operation Varsity Blues.

Former casino executive Gamal Abdelaziz was the first to appear before Magistrate Judge Page Kelley.

Abdelaziz, the former president of Wynn Macau, who has also held leadership roles at Caesars Entertainment and MGM Resorts, didn’t make a statement in court, like most defendants. But his lawyer told the judge his client intends to fight the charges.

“This is not a strong case,” Brian Kelly said as he requested permission for Abdelaziz to travel to Mexico on business next month.

“This is a one-witness case” that relies on a “deeply compromised” witness, he said. “This is winnable.” Kelley granted the request on the condition Abdelaziz turn in his passport after the trip.

Abdelaziz is among 33 prominent parents charged in what authorities have called the biggest college admissions scam ever prosecuted . Authorities say the parents paid an admission consultant to rig their children’s test scores and bribe coaches at sought-after schools.

The most familiar names of the accused parents are actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin, but they’re not scheduled to appear in court until next week.

Among the others appearing Friday is 48-year-old Michelle Janavs, a former executive at her family’s food manufacturing company, Chef America, which made Hot Pockets before being bought out by Nestle for $2.6 billion in 2002.

She is accused of paying at least $100,000 to help her two daughters cheat on their college admissions exam and get into the University of Southern California as beach volleyball recruits.

William McGlashan, a 58-year-old former executive for the private equity firm TPG, is accused of paying bribes to get his son into USC as a recruit for the college’s storied football team, even though his son didn’t play football and his high school didn’t field a team.

And 53-year-old Austine Huneeus, whose family owns vineyards in California’s Napa Valley and in Oregon, is accused of paying at least $50,000 to have SAT administrators correct his daughter’s college entrance exam and to have USC officials designate her as a water polo recruit to improve her chances of getting into the college.

The initial court appearances are largely a formality.

Defendants weren’t asked to enter a plea Friday. Court officials simply recited the charges and maximum sentences while the judge informed the defendants of their rights and considered any special requests, such as Abdelaziz’s travel request.

The other defendants appearing Friday include prominent Miami developer Robert Zangrillo; Gregory Abbott, the founder and chairman of International Dispensing Corp. and his wife, Marcia Abbott; and Marci Palatella, who founded bourbon maker Preservation Distillery in Kentucky.

On Thursday, former Yale University women’s soccer coach Rudy Meredith became the third person to plead guilty in the case. Rick Singer, the admissions consultant at the center of the scheme, has also pleaded guilty.

Google has removed an app from the Google Play store which encouraged gay people to go through “conversion therapy,” following complaints from LGBT groups. Google still hasn’t removed an app which allows users to report “heresy” to Indonesia’s strict Muslim government, however, nor has the company removed a Saudi Arabian app which allows men to track women and limit their movement.

According to Business Insider, Google removed an app called “Living Hope Ministries” after it “encouraged LGBTQ people to seek conversion therapy.”

“The tech giant came under intense pressure to delete the app from the Google Play store, with a petition calling for its removal receiving more than 140,000 signatures,” Business Insider reported, adding that the company “consulted with outside advocacy groups before acting.”

In a statement, a spokesman for Google claimed that the company removed the app “after consulting with outside advocacy groups, reviewing our policies, and making sure we had a thorough understanding of the app and its relation to conversion therapy.”

As of writing, the petition to get the app removed has over 142,000 signatures, and the Human Rights Campaign congratulated Google for removing the app.

BREAKING: @Axios' @inafried reports Google has pulled down the dangerous so-called "conversion therapy app." We applaud @Google for making the right decision to pull this from their online store, an important step to protect LGBTQ youth.

Google has still yet to remove an Indonesian app which allows users to report “heresy” to the strict Muslim government, however, and has also not removed a Saudi Arabian app which allows men to track and limit women’s movements.

The Indonesian app, Smart Pakem, made news headlines last year, yet the app is still available on the Google Play store.

The Saudi Arabian app, Absher, was reported on in February, and is also still available, despite calls from Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) for Google to remove the app.

Last year, LGBT apps were pulled from the Google Play store in Indonesia amid persecution against LGBT people in the country.

Will & Grace actor Sean Hayes targeted Vice President Mike Pence for mockery at the GLAAD Media Awards Thursday.

“That’s like three proud decades of being Mike Pence’s worst nightmare,” Sean Hayes said of the 30th annual GLAAD event.

“Or wildest dream. We’ll never know,” he added.

Oh, Sean Hayes went there. 😬 pic.twitter.com/jo22U0SEXT — Marc Malkin (@marcmalkin) March 29, 2019

Actress Debra Messing, another Will & Grace alum, is very politically outspoken. Last year, she declared that members of the Trump administration were all going to burn in hell.

Hayes and Messing starred in a video encouraging voter turnout last October in the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections.

The GLAAD event Thursday was packed with star power, including Beyonce and Jay-Z. The couple received the group’s “Vanguard Award.”

The group says the award honors “allies who have made a significant difference in promoting acceptance of LGBTQ people.”

Jay-Z honored his mother, Gloria Carter, a lesbian whose story was featured last year in his song and video “Smile.”

Beyonce told the audience one of her most beautiful memories about respect was on her tour “looking out from the stage every night and seeing the hardest gangsta trappin’ right next to the most fabulous queen.”

The “Tom Ford” rapper received the award despite having a long history of using homophobic slurs in his music.

Tyler R. Barriss, 26, was sentenced to 20 years in prison after pleading guilty to 51 federal charges — some of which led to the 2017 death of 28-year-old Andrew Finch.

Barriss has admitted to contacting the Wichita police from Los Angeles on Dec. 28, 2017 — with the explicit intent of falsely reporting a shooting and kidnapping at a Wichita residence. The Associated Press reports, “Authorities say an Ohio gamer recruited Barriss to ‘swat’ a Wichita gamer, but that the address they used was old, leading police to Finch, who was not involved in the video game or the dispute.”

When Finch answered the door, he was shot to death by a member of law enforcement.

Shane Gaskill and Casey Viner have been charged as co-conspirators. According to the Associated Press, “authorities say Viner provided Barriss with an address for Gaskill that Gaskill had previously given to Viner. Authorities also say that when Gaskill noticed Barriss was following him on Twitter, he gave Barriss that old address and taunted him to ‘try something.'”

All three allegedly conspired to call in bomb and shooting reports to a high school and convention center in Connecticut, as well as locations in Texas, Indiana, Ohio, Missouri, and Illinois. Both Gaskill and Viner have pled not guilty to crimes including conspiracy to obstruct justice and wire fraud, but Viner has signaled his intention to change his plea at a hearing scheduled for April 3.

Finch’s family has filed a lawsuit against both the city of Wichita and the police officer involved. Prosecutors, however, have declined to charge the unidentified law enforcement agent.

White members of the press were barred from entering the Bolton Street Baptist Church for a community event highlighting black mayoral candidates in Savannah, Georgia.

The sign on the church door was anything but subtle: “No media (T.V. Radio, etc.) Black Press Only!” All white reporters were prevented from entering the premises, while black reporters from two television stations, as well as the publisher of the Savannah Tribune newspaper, were permitted.

The Trigon consultant group was in charge of promoting the event, described as being “about supporting ONE candidate from the African American Community for Mayor 2019!” Both potential candidates in attendance are running in an attempt to beat incumbent Mayor Eddie Deloach — the first white mayor of Savannah in 20 years when he was elected.

Stephen Moody, a reporter with WJCL who attended the event, said that no recording of any kind was allowed. Savannah Alderman Van Johnson spoke at the meeting but did not address the access restrictions. “It’s not my meeting,” Johnson said. “I was asked to come and give a statement, so I came and I gave a statement. What I said in there, I’ll say out here.”

Louis Wilson — one of the candidates defeated by Deloach — is making another run at the office. He also declined to comment on the event’s policy. “I didn’t plan the meeting so I can’t comment on that part,” he said. “I came to say what I had to say.”

A suspected Sinaloa Cartel operative was arrested south of the California border this week by the State Preventive Police (PEP) of Baja California after they discovered three firearms and two pounds of methamphetamine during a traffic stop in Mexicali.

Elements of the PEP patrolling in Mexicali came upon a red 2001 Jeep Cherokee. Their attention was drawn to this vehicle since they previously received intelligence pertaining to the driver. The state police later identified the man as Raúl “N,” 23. Officers discovered three firearms, four magazines, numerous rounds of various caliber, a ballistic vest, and a kilogram of methamphetamine, according to local media reports.

The driver was subsequently arrested for illegal possession of firearms and drug charges. The man is suspected of being an operative for the Sinaloa Cartel in the Mexicali Valley region, according to local Breitbart law enforcement sources. The valley is a key region for drug and human smuggling activities into Imperial Valley, California, with easy access to Los Angeles and Phoenix.

Mexican authorities and U.S. counterparts continue to make large seizures of methamphetamine along the California and Arizona borders. According to Breitbart law enforcement sources, most seizures are the result of the Sinaloa Cartel’s escalated production with “super labs.”

Breitbart News recently reported on a major seizure in the region by elements of the Mexican Federal Police, who seized approximately one ton of meth, heroin, and fentanyl. Police were conducting security operations along the Mexico-California border at the time.

Robert Arce is a retired Phoenix Police detective with extensive experience working Mexican organized crime and street gangs. Arce has worked in the Balkans, Iraq, Haiti, and recently completed a three-year assignment in Monterrey, Mexico, working out of the Consulate for the United States Department of State, International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Program, where he was the Regional Program Manager for Northeast Mexico (Coahuila, Tamaulipas, Nuevo Leon, Durango, San Luis Potosi, Zacatecas.)

A year-long DEA Task Force investigation culminated this week in Charlotte, North Carolina, resulting in the takedown of a major Mexican cartel-linked operation and the arrests of more than a dozen engaged in the sale of heroin, meth, and cocaine.

A total of 18 arrests were made in addition to the seizure of 40 pounds of heroin, 20 pounds of methamphetamine, and 15.4 pounds of cocaine, according to the DEA. Also recovered was a handgun and $8,000 cash, according to local reports. Many of those arrested were determined to be in the country illegally.

A year-long DEA Task Force investigation has resulted in 18 arrests, most in Charlotte and the seizure of 40 lbs of heroin, 20 pounds of meth, and more than 15 lbs of cocaine. The drugs have a street value of $3.5 million. pic.twitter.com/LNoMuWAraR — CMPD News (@CMPD) March 28, 2019

The investigation revealed the operation had links to Cártel Jalisco Nueva Generación (CJNG).

“This cartel is one of the most deadly cartels in America, operating in America,” said DEA acting assistant special agent in charge Dustin Harmon. Authorities indicated that the drugs seized were to be sold across the Charlotte region.

“Those are the drugs causing overdose deaths, a lot of pain and suffering and misery in the community and we want to do everything we can to stop that,” said Mecklenburg County Assistant DA Jeff Davis. The DEA said that there have been overdoses in the region linked to the busted group. The investigation also resulted in arrests in California.

The SBI assisted the DEA on a case involving 18 arrests where 40 lbs. of heroin, 20 lbs. of meth. & 7 kg of cocaine were recovered. That’s a $3.5 million street value. DEA Acting ASAC Harmon & SBI SAC Bridges talked with @wsoctv @AllisonWSOC9 about the impact on #Clt. pic.twitter.com/Wt9crUSrjf — NC SBI (@SBI1937) March 28, 2019

The drugs were transported to the Charlotte area in vehicles equipped with hidden compartments and by air. Breitbart News reported earlier this week about a Mexican cartel-linked drug operation busted in Minneapolis, Minnesota, after a raid on a luxury high-rise residence. It was later determined the drugs were transported and delivered in two suitcases by air travel.

The CJNG is blamed for much of the recent record-breaking killings in Mexico as they quickly move to claim new territories.

A member of the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas gang pleaded guilty to human smuggling charges for his role in trying to sneak two migrants past a U.S. Border Patrol checkpoint.

This week, 33-year-old Cody Michael Matousek, an alleged member of the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas in Galveston, entered a guilty plea in federal court on the charge of human smuggling and human smuggling conspiracy. He remains in federal custody pending sentencing. Matousek’s co-conspirator, 38-year-old Guadalupe Levario, also pleaded guilty to the charge but was allowed to remain free on bond.

According to information provided to Breitbart News by the U.S Attorney’s Office, the charges against the two men stem from a February 8 human smuggling attempt where they tried to use a wrecker service to move a pickup truck past a U.S. Border Patrol checkpoint. Inside the towed vehicle hid two migrants from Brazil.

Matousek originally picked up the two migrants a day prior in Mission, Texas, and moved them to a stash house. From there, Matousek and Levario organized for an apparently uninvolved wrecker service to transport the “broken down” vehicle through a checkpoint. The tow driver assented to a search of the vehicle, revealing the hidden Brazilians. The illegal immigrants then advised authorities about their smugglers waiting at a rendezvous point in Kingsville.

Prosecutors said Matousek was the subject in other investigations involving a human smuggling cell run by the Aryan Brotherhood. Authorities singled out Matousek as one of the main organizers.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) has entered week two of her crybaby meltdown over disastrous poll numbers and now she’s blaming Fox News and Breitbart News for her unpopularity.

Quinnipiac is one of the most unreliable left-wing pollsters out there (not named Marist or CNN), so when the Q-poll has bad news for America’s Socialist “It Girl,” it is worth taking notice.

Quinnipiac found Ocasio-Crazy’s national favorability rating sits at a pathetic 23 percent; her unfavorable is 36 percent, which means she is upside down by double digits — 13 whole points.

But here is sweetest part of the song … only 47 percent of Democrats — Democrats, y’all — view Ocasio-Crazy favorably. Seven percent view her unfavorably and 44 percent have no idea who she is.

Among Independents, the self-proclaimed socialist (who grew up in Westchester — LOL) is upside-down 16 points — 20 to 36 percent.

Ocasio-CowFart is even upside down with women, 27 to 30 percent.

Faced with this news, the freshman congresswoman went the full-black helicopter. After posting a link to her terrible, awful, very bad polling news, she tweeted, “It’s almost as though there is a directed + concerted far-right propaganda machine with a whole cable news channel, and a dark-money internet operation propped up by the Mercers et al dedicated to maligning me & stoking nat’l division[.]”

It’s almost as though there is a directed + concerted far-right propaganda machine with a whole cable news channel, and a dark-money internet operation propped up by the Mercers et al dedicated to maligning me & stoking nat’l division, reported on by @JaneMayerNYer or something https://t.co/HChBp04c8W — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) March 29, 2019

What’s driving Ocasio-Crazy crazy is that this is the fourth poll this year that proves just how wildly unpopular she and her terrible ideas are.

Gallup has her upside down by ten points, 31 percent favorable to 41 percent unfavorable.

Earlier this month, a Siena College poll found that President Donald Trump is more popular in the bluer than blue state of New York than she is. Only 31 percent of New Yorkers view the Pixie Demagogue favorably, compared to 36 percent for Trump.

The Morning Consult poll has her upside down by 4 points; 24 to 28 percent.

A Fox poll has her upside down by 13 points; 26 to 39 percent.

Sorry, cupcake, nobody likes you.

And why would we?

You want to slaughter all our cows, confiscate that which makes Americans Americans (guns, cars, and meat), and you gesticulate like a drunken Beto O’Rourke explaining why he didn’t leave the scene of an accident…

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4ZX0wm45SA

You’re a bossy busybody who wants to central plan all of our lives, who hides her desire to rule over us behind chirpy blah-blah-blah about saving us.

But that doesn’t mean she’s entirely wrong…

Let me put it this way — I hope she’s right about Fox News and Breitbart News being responsible for these humiliating poll numbers, because what that means for the country makes me giddy.

Think about it…

Ocasio-Crazy is the perfect test case in the ongoing war between the fake and illegitimate establishment media and the conservative media.

To begin with, she’s new on the scene and therefore undefined.

Secondly, the establishment media immediately made a project of her; conspired to make her The Next Big Thing, a National Leader, an Influencer and Opinion Leader.

The process through which the media anoint the anointed, the farm team through which the media create The Leaders of Tomorrow, fell at her feet through countless fawning media profiles, high-profile interviews filled with softball questions — all that jazz.

What’s more, Ocasio-Crazy is young and appealing and charismatic. But…

The media’s campaign failed this time, failed to define her voice and ideas as The Future, and it failed because Conservative Media saw her for what she is (a phony, power-mad, not terribly bright fanatic) and we are now able to get the word out, to compete with the corporate media in the news cycle.

And we won, the truth won… And more importantly, the establishment media lost.

More proof the media no longer hold the power to manipulate public opinion?

I think so.

And the fake news lost the Ocasio-Crazy battle before the Mueller Report, before the bottom fell out of the media’s credibility among millions and millions of Democrats who are just now waking up to the fact they were hustled for two years with an absurd lie and conspiracy theory.

The media landscape is shifting — not dramatically, but noticeably, and this is a wonderful thing.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) has entered week two of her crybaby meltdown over disastrous poll numbers and now she’s blaming Fox News and Breitbart News for her unpopularity.

Quinnipiac is one of the most unreliable left-wing pollsters out there (not named Marist or CNN), so when the Q-poll has bad news for America’s Socialist “It Girl,” it is worth taking notice.

Quinnipiac found Ocasio-Crazy’s national favorability rating sits at a pathetic 23 percent; her unfavorable is 36 percent, which means she is upside down by double digits — 13 whole points.

But here is sweetest part of the song … only 47 percent of Democrats — Democrats, y’all — view Ocasio-Crazy favorably. Seven percent view her unfavorably and 44 percent have no idea who she is.

Among Independents, the self-proclaimed socialist (who grew up in Westchester — LOL) is upside-down 16 points — 20 to 36 percent.

Ocasio-CowFart is even upside down with women, 27 to 30 percent.

Faced with this news, the freshman congresswoman went the full-black helicopter. After posting a link to her terrible, awful, very bad polling news, she tweeted, “It’s almost as though there is a directed + concerted far-right propaganda machine with a whole cable news channel, and a dark-money internet operation propped up by the Mercers et al dedicated to maligning me & stoking nat’l division[.]”

Small Business Administration head Linda McMahon is expected to announce her resignation from President Donald Trump’s Cabinet as early as Friday, according to Politico.

Politico’s Alex Isenstadt and Eliana Johnson report McMahon is expected to join a pro-Trump super PAC in a “senior capacity as the president ramps up his 2020 re-election efforts.

NEWS w/ @elianayjohnson: Linda McMahon to join pro-Trump super PAC in senior capacity, per 3 sources…story tk… — Alex Isenstadt (@politicoalex) March 29, 2019

The development comes as McMahon is scheduled to attend a fundraiser with President Trump at Mar-a-Lago in south Flordia this weekend.

Politico reports:

McMahon, who has known Trump for years, has kept a relatively low profile at SBA. Unlike other Trump administration Cabinet officials, she has not been dogged by scandal. Inside the White House, she’s seen as a loyal foot soldier. She regularly travels around the country to promote the president’s agenda, including recent trips to promote the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal.

While it is unclear who will replace McMahon, Pradeep Belur, the SBA’s chief of staff, has been floated as a possible contender.

McMahon previously served as the CEO at WWE before leaving the wrestling giant in 2009 to run for the U.S. Senate in Connecticut. She lost two bids for Senate in 2010 and 2012 against her Democrat rivals Sens. Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy, who endorsed her nomination to the SBA. The Senate voted to confirm McMahon 81-19.

At the time of her confirmation, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said McMahon will “prioritize growing jobs over growing government bureaucracy.”

“In so many states, including mine, that’s a welcome change from Washington,” he added.

Throughout her tenure as SBA chief, President Trump has repeated praised McMahon’s business acumen, describing her as “one of the country’s top female executives.”

Several Democrat members of Congress have replaced their POW/MIA flags with transgender pride flags outside their congressional offices on Capitol Hill.

A group of Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have eliminated their military flags in exchange for the pink, blue, and white transgender pride flag to protest the military ban on trans soldiers, Fox News reported.

The stunt apparently came at the request of the “National Center for Transgender Equality,” Fox News reported. The group released a statement claiming to have sent the flag to members of Congress with a letter asking them to be displayed to protest President Trump’s plan to exclude trans individuals from serving in the military:

Members of the Senate also joined the effort, one being Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

“Discrimination has no place in our society. I am proud to display this flag as a symbol of my support for transgender people across the country. We must stand with transgender people in all of our communities,” Sanders tweeted this week:

Other Democrats who placed the flag outside their office include Massachusetts Rep. Joe Kennedy, Washington Reps. Adam Smith and Kim Schrier, Ohio’s Tim Ryan, and Virginia Rep. Jennifer Wexton, among others.

President Trump’s ban on transgender members in the military remains mired in the courts, but the U.S. Supreme Court recently allowed the ban to continue despite a lower court’s ruling to put a halt on the ban as lawsuits against the policy wind their way through the system.

This story has been updated to specify the flags are for transgender pride.

Friday on Fox News Channel’s “Fox & Friends,” 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Gov. Jay Inslee (D-WA) Friday called President Donald Trump “cowardly” on climate change.

When asked about the cost of the so-called Green News Deal, Inslee said, “What is is expensive is losing jobs to the Chinese and the Germans. Look we want these jobs in our country. We want to build wind turbines in our country in Iowa we want to build batteries for electric cars in Nevada. We want to build electric cars like we are doing today. Look they are putting on 400 new jobs in Michigan the same week Donald Trump is so cowardly and pessimistic.”

He continued, “This is a can-do nation. We put a man on the moon; we defeated Fascism. We can use our smarts to build a clean energy economy like we are doing right today. We need an inspirational leader, not a pessimistic one in the White House. I think I am ready for that job. This country is ready for a spark of optimism.”

He added, “When your town is burning down the people of Paradise, CA are talking about climate change. They deserve a president who will protect them, rather than the oil industries. I’m tired of putting out billions of dollars to the fossil fuel industry and lobbyists, and he is put in charge of this nation. He wanted to drain the swamp. He put the swamp in charge of our tax policies. It is just wrong.”

Microsoft founder Bill Gates celebrated proposed legislation which would advance the development of nuclear energy technology, Thursday.

Gates, a notable backer of nuclear energy, responded to proposed legislation “which establishes an ambitious plan to accelerate the development of advanced nuclear reactor technologies,” Thursday.

“Yesterday, a bipartisan group of leaders in the U.S. Senate introduced the Nuclear Energy Leadership Act, which establishes an ambitious plan to accelerate the development of advanced nuclear reactor technologies. I can’t overstate how important this is,” Gates declared. “To prevent the worst effects of climate change, we need to reach near-zero emissions on all the things that drive it—agriculture, electricity, manufacturing, transportation, and buildings—by investing in innovation across all sectors while deploying low cost renewables.”

“Nuclear energy is one of these critical technologies. It’s ideal for dealing with climate change, because it is the only carbon-free, scalable energy source that’s available 24 hours a day,” he continued. “I’m thrilled that senators from both sides of the aisle have come together to support advanced nuclear. This is exactly the kind of leadership our country needs to both solve the climate challenge and reassert our leadership in this important industry.”

The legislation, titled the Nuclear Energy Leadership Act, would “direct the Secretary of Energy to establish advanced nuclear goals, provide for a versatile, reactor-based fast neutron source, make available high assay, low-enriched uranium for research, development, and demonstration of advanced nuclear reactor concepts, and for other purposes.”

It was introduced by Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), Sen. James Risch (R-ID), Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV), Sen. Mike Crapo (R-ID), Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN), Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Sen. Cory Gardner (R-CO), Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE), Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-SC), Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO), Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), and Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH).

“The Nuclear Energy Leadership Act (NELA), aims to reestablish U.S. leadership in nuclear energy,” claimed a press release. “It will bring together private and public sector innovators to develop next-generation advanced reactor concepts.”

As reported by GeekWire, “Back in December, Gates listed nuclear energy research as one of his top policy priorities, and he reportedly followed up by promising lawmakers he’d invest $1 billion of his own money and line up another $1 billion in private capital if federal funds were approved for a TerraPower pilot project in the United States.”

A report published in the Journal of Industrial Ecology claims that white people’s eating habits are contributing more to climate change than their black and Latino counterparts.

Report authors concluded, using data on food production — use of water, land, production, and distribution — that white people’s diet causes more greenhouse gas emissions.

“Potatoes, beef, apples, and milk are some of the worst offenders,” the New York Post reported.

“The food pipeline — which includes its production, distribution, and waste — contributes significantly to climate change through the production of greenhouse gases and requires significant amounts of water and land, which also has environmental effects,” Joe Bozeman, a student at the University of Illinois who helped produce the report, said.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) contributed to the report, providing data on more than 500 food groups and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) weighed in on individual diets.

The Post reported:

Data showed that whites produced an average of 680 kilograms of the CO2 each year, attributable to food and drink, whereas Latinx individuals produced 640 kilograms, and blacks 600. They also found the diets of white people required 328,000 liters of water on average per year. Latinx used just 307,000 liters, and blacks 311,800. Both black and Latinx individuals used more land per capita with 1,770 and 1,710 square meters per year, respectively than white people with just 1,550. Nevertheless, white people still made the greatest overall contribution to climate change.

The underlying purpose of the study is ominous, calling for policies to address the findings.

“The study was undertaken to get a better understanding of the environmental impacts of the food consumption patterns of major demographic groups so that environmental policies designed to reduce negative impacts of food production could be drafted that take these differences into account,” a press release announcing the report said.

“If you are going to draft policies that may reduce the amount of land-intensive oranges, we need to think about other less resource-intensive sources of vitamin C,” Bozeman said. “It gets more complex as you look closely at the food pipeline and how different populations engage with it, but we are now starting to get a better understanding on these complex dynamics in such a way that we can begin to rationally take steps to improve environmental quality.”

The report Abstract stated, in part:

Our findings suggest that obtaining data with the intention of building consensus across sociodemographic lines overcomes barriers in the understanding phase, leading to increased social receptivity for many planning and managing phase processes. Specifically, we find that identifying and developing leaders who possess the cognitive and interpersonal capacity to manage many variables and stakeholders is key to assessing and selecting adaptation options in the planning phase. We also propose using government programming to encourage environmentally friendly food purchasing behavior. Then, we discuss how our proposals could be used in adaptation feasibility and evaluation activities in the managing phase. In all, these findings facilitate the development of improved climate change adaptation and policy by satisfying the understanding phase of the climate change adaptation framework, establishing a cross‐disciplinary methodological approach to addressing socioecological problems, and providing useful FEW impact data for FEW nexus and climate change researchers.

“While the difference may not be enormous, these numbers are per individual, and when you add up all those individuals, it’s very clear that whites are responsible for the majority of greenhouse gases emitted as a result of their food choices,” Bozeman said.

Halloween star Jamie Lee Curtis took out after former Vice President Joe Biden for his recent comments about Anita Hill, demanding the possible 2020 White House hopeful to just apologize to Hill.

The True Lies actress slammed Biden in a mostly all caps tweet, Thursday, demanding that Biden drop all the jaw-jaw and just apologize to Anita Hill for his part in the 1991 confirmation hearings to place Clarence Thomas on the U.S. Supreme Court where Hill came forward to claim Thomas sexually harassed her.

“Come on @JoeBiden,” Curtis tweeted. “Just CALL Anita Hill and then GO TO HER HOUSE and APOLOGIZE to her FACE. The longer you wait, the worse it gets.”

Come on @JoeBiden . Just CALL Anita Hill and then GO TO HER HOUSE and APOLOGIZE to her FACE. The longer you wait the worse it gets. — Jamie Lee Curtis (@jamieleecurtis) March 27, 2019

Curtis’ comments came on the heels of Biden’s appearance before an event in New York for his Joe Biden Foundation where he claimed that he has “always regretted” not being able to do more to help Anita Hill during the 1991 hearings.

During his address Biden said he sure wishes he could have done more to help “national hero” Anita Hill back when she was testifying before a Senate committee about claims of sexual harassment perpetrated against her by now Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.

“A brave lawyer, a really notable woman, Anita Hill, a professor, showed the courage of a lifetime talking about her experience being harassed by Clarence Thomas,” Biden said in New York on Wednesday. “But she paid a terrible price. She was abused in the hearing. She was taken advantage of. Her reputation was attacked. I wish I could have done something.”

Despite Biden’s proclamations that he did all he could to help Hill, many voices in the liberal press quickly pointed out that Joe could have done much more and that he has never apologized to Hill in person for his actions.

Former Vice President Joe Biden leads Sen. Bernie Sanders by 19 points in a 2020 primary poll of Pennsylvania.

Biden is leading with 39 percent support in Pennsylvania, while Sanders only has 20 percent, according to a poll conducted by Emerson College.

Sanders has a healthy 15 point lead above Biden from voters 18-29 years old but Biden leads with 40 percent support among 30-49 years olds, 38 percent among 50-64 years olds, and 55 percent among those 65 years or older.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren is in third place with eleven percent and Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg is in fourth place with 6 percent.

Former Congressman Beto O’Rourke and Sen. Kamala Harris tie for fifth place followed by Sen. Cory Booker, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, and Andrew Yang.

The poll shows that both Biden and Sanders are currently leading Trump in Pennsylvania by five points, but still within the margin of error.

The poll was conducted March 26-28 among 808 registered voters of 565 contacted by landlines and 242 responding to an online panel with a +/- 3.4 percent margin of error.

SCARBOROUGH: First of all, let’s talk about Nancy Pelosi. She’s been pitch perfect —

BRZEZINSKI: —So elegant.

SCARBOROUGH: — time and time again. She was the person that oversaw the greatest defeat of the Republican Party in midterms, in terms of vote, in the history of this country. She also oversaw the greatest gain of seats by Democrats since Watergate in 1974. Republicans have been running against her for years and it just has failed miserably. The first woman to ever be elected Speaker of the House in 2006 and she comes roaring back in 2018 with a truly historic wipeout of the Republican Party, and man, she is in complete control of her caucus and of the Democratic message right now.

BRZEZINSKI: You know, I was interviewing her for one of my Know Your Value books thats coming out next fall and I talked to her about negotiating and I’ll try to remember the exact quote, but she said, One of the reasons why I’m an expert negotiator, why I am so good at negotiating is that I have a supreme knowledge of the data, the information, of the content that which I am negotiating. She goes, I have a supreme knowledge, I have discipline, I know what I’m doing and it all makes me an excellent negotiator.” And, she was giving advice to women on negotiating skills, but her confidence was, I mean, I wast just enjoying the interview so much and I was loving that she is doing what she’s doing and is in the job as Speaker of the House, which is one of the highest positions in the country.

Republican Rep. Lance Gooden of Texas asked for unanimous consent Wednesday for the House to consider a vote on the Born-Alive legislation that would protect babies who survive abortion.

Today, I asked the House to consider a bill from @RepAnnWagner to protect the lives of newborn infants who survive late-term abortions. Why in the world would House Democrats be opposed to preventing infanticide and giving these babies the medical care they deserve? pic.twitter.com/PpfTaIfAKT — Lance Gooden (@RepLanceGooden) March 27, 2019

For the 22nd time, House Democrats rejected a vote on H.R. 962, a bill that would require an infant who is born alive following an attempted abortion to receive the same form of prompt transfer to a hospital and medical attention any other child would be given.

House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, a Republican from Louisiana, and Republican Rep. Ann Wagner of Missouri introduced the bill on February 6 and Scalia intends to file a discharge petition that may be signed by other House members when it becomes active on April 2 if no action is taken by Democrat leaders. When a majority of members sign onto the discharge petition, it will force a vote on the Born-Alive legislation.

🚨🚨 BREAKING → I’ll be filing a discharge petition on @RepAnnWagner's Born Alive bill on April 2nd. This petition will bypass Nancy Pelosi & force a vote on the floor to #EndInfanticide if a majority of members sign on. Tell your representative to sign this petition! #LetUsVote — Steve Scalise (@SteveScalise) March 26, 2019

“This is the 24th time in total that Congressional Democrats thwarted an attempt by Republicans to vote on a bill that would provide medical care and treatment for babies who provide survived failed abortions — 22 times in the House and twice in the Senate,” observed pro-life media LifeNews.

Family Research Council President Tony Perkins said in a statement that “providing health care to babies born alive is an issue that should receive unanimous support, regardless of your position on abortion.”

“By continuing to block this commonsense legislation, Democratic leadership in the House is essentially giving the green light to infanticide,” he added. “There is no practice more barbaric than killing babies that could survive if given care.”

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy tweeted on March 25:

In February Senate Democrats voted against the Born-Alive legislation introduced in that chamber by Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Sasse. The bill failed as a result since it required a 60-vote supermajority for approval and Republicans could only obtain 53 votes for it.

“The silence from Congressional Democrats is deafening and shameful,” Scalise said upon the introduction of the legislation. “Every Member of Congress, regardless of party, needs to go on record against infanticide, and we must immediately take action to stop it. The American people deserve to know where their representatives stand on this critical issue.”

Perkins said America is at “a moment of decision.”

“Whether or not we will allow infanticide – the murder of a baby who survives the first attempt on their life – has become a defining issue for us as a nation,” he said.

Britain’s House of Commons has voted to reject Theresa May’s so-called Withdrawal Agreement just hours before the nation was supposed to leave the European Union, with or without a deal — a deadline betrayed this week by Parliament after they voted to postpone Brexit months or even years into the future.

Britain’s lawmakers have already voted against the settlement the Prime Minister agreed with the European Union twice, and the government was blocked from bringing it to Parliament again. Yet by splitting the deal into two pieces, the ‘Brexit in name only‘ apparently comes before Parliament again as a different vote in spirit only.

UPDATE 1830 — Nigel speaks to the rally

Nigel Farage has struck an optimistic note on this day of Brexit betrayal, telling the Parliament square rally:

I can’t think of any time in history, where a greater betrayal of a democratic vote has ever happened in the Western world, and they can tonight over there content themselves because they think they’re winning. But that’s because they live in the Westminster bubble. We’re the real people of this country, and we know that the referendum was the first of many great victories. We will get our country back, we will get out independence back, we will get out pride and self-respect back. We are going to win!

UPDATE 1710 — May meets cabinet members

The Prime Minister is reportedly meeting with a delegation of Cabinet ministers, who are thought to be urging her to adopt an even weaker form of Brexit than the one outlined in the seemingly abandoned Political Declaration which formerly accompanied the thrice-defeated Withdrawal Agreement, possibly involving full membership of the EU Customs Union, or “a” customs union which would have the same practical effect.

This would almost certainly kill any chance of the United Kingdom being able to strike new trade deals with countries like the United States, Australia, and New Zealand after Brexit, and leave the EU able to barter access to British markets without Britain’s political representatives having any say in the matter while striking its own trade deals.

Meanwhile, Nigel Farage is enjoying the crowds in Parliament Square…

UPDATE 1705 — EU’s Brexit Negotiator Floats Upgrading May’s ‘Worst Deal Ever’ to ‘Worst Deal Ever Plus Customs Union’

In comments reported by politico.eu, Michel Barnier suggested that the EU he was open to a deal which would mean the UK would maintain the same tariffs and trade policies as the EU, appealing to Remainer parliamentarians who want to stop a clean break.

“We are ready to be even more ambitious should the U.K.’s red-lines evolve. For instance, we are open to work on the principle of a permanent customs union should the U.K. decide to take this path,” Mr Barnier said at the College of Europe campus in Warsaw, Poland.

However, Barnier added, “Let me be frank: Without a positive choice, the default option would be a no-deal, which has become more likely. It was never our scenario, but the EU27 is now prepared.”

UPDATE 1650 — Tory Brexiteer cautions against optimism

Veteran Tory MP Michael Fabricant has warned that, “If #Brexiteers think that a victory has been won, because #Remainers and #Labour voted down the #Deal, think again.”

Mr Fabricant, a Brexiteer himself, who backed the deal with some reluctance, predicted that “On Monday, the #Remainer Parliament will try to keep us in the Customs Union which means our obeying #EU legislation and having no say in making them. Worse than [before]”.

However, the deal would have involved also have involved a “transition period” lasting to the end of December 2022 in which Britain would have essentially remained a full member of the European Union, minus its representation in the EU institutions — with Remainers able to push for a switch back to formal membership at the end of it if the despised backstop remained the only deal on offer.

UPDATE 1625 — Europe mouthpiece Ireland talks up long Brexit delay

Irish taoiseach (prime minister) Leo Varadkar is set for to meet with Germany’s Angela Merkel and France’s Emmanuel Macron for crunch talks in the wake of the Withdrawal Agreement’s rejection.

“These two meetings reflect the deep and warm relations Ireland enjoys with both France and Germany, including the support shown to Ireland during the Brexit negotiations,” said a spokesman for the Irish leader, who has been extremely combative throughout the EU’s talks with the British, despite his country’s heavy economic dependence on trade both with and via the United Kingdom, and the enormous blow which would fall on it in the event of No Deal.

“The [Irish] Government notes the decision of the House of Commons to reject the indicative Withdrawal Agreement. It is now up to the UK to indicate how it plans to proceed in order to avoid a No Deal scenario,” the taoiseach remarked in a separate statement on the British vote.

“We must be open to a long extension, should the United Kingdom decide to fundamentally reconsider its approach to Brexit,” he added.

UPDATE 1610 — In other news…

The Independent Group have chosen today to rebrand themselves as a political party in time, they hope, to challenge the potential European Parliament elections in May.

To the amusement of some on social media, they have chosen to call themselves the Change UK party — odd, given they are campaigning to keep things the same. Read more on Breitbart London:

UPDATE 1605 — Sir Bernard Jenkin: There are only 160 MPs who really believe in leaving the European Union

Saying that the most likely outcome of today’s developments was a longer extension, Sir Bernard said, “This only arises because there are about 160 MPs in parliament who really believe in leaving the European Union and the withdrawal agreement we ended up with was negotiated in such a way as to keep us poised to rejoin at some stage.

On Prime Minister Theresa May’s successor, the Tory Brexiteer said, “I think it’s important to have somebody that has the confidence of the whole party and we don’t have another kind of coronation like we had last time.

“I think the membership of the party must have the final choice and that makes its very likely we end up with someone who supports leave the European Union.

“We can’t have another prime minister who says she wants to leave the European Union and respects the result when they don’t believe in that project… putting someone in charge of a project they don’t believe in doesn’t work as we’ve learnt.”

Sir Bernard echoes the sentiments of former Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith who said told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme this morning, “We want the second phase [of Brexit negotiations] to be led by someone who passionately believes in what 17.4 million people voted for, which was to leave the European Union.”

“Now is the time for a new set of hands with a proper professional team that actually believes in Brexit and gets us through the next phase,” Mr Duncan Smith added.

UPDATE 1556 — Pro-Brexit demonstrators gathering outside Parliament

Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage has welcomed the defeat of Mrs May’s deal, but warned that it appears there are now fresh battles ahead for Brexiteers.

“The new EU treaty has been rightly defeated for a third time. Extension and further battles now seem inevitable,” he observed, vowing: “We are not downhearted, and will fight them again”

UPDATE 1542 — Diehard Brexiteer gives his reasoning

Steve Baker MP, the former Brexit minister and Deputy Chairman of the European Research Group (ERG) who voted against the Withdrawal Agreement, has revealed that he wrestled with whether or not to back it until the last minute.

“As late as last night I was sitting in the library here writing an article on how I was going to be forced to vote for the agreement, because in the Commons we’re beaten on the numbers,” he confessed.

“But I just realised I’m not going to surrender; it’s a rotten deal for the UK, the voters know it, they’re here today telling me so, and I concluded I’m never going to surrender to vote for this deal and this backstop,” he told Sky News.

He also reiterated his near-instantaneous call for Mrs May to go in the wake of her defeat, saying she had “used up all her political capital” in her failed efforts to get the deal over the line.

“Really, it is time to accept that this deal’s not going through, it is no good [to] keep following the same path, so I would like the Government to go to this [European] Council which has been announced [on April 10th] and ask for changes on the backstop,” he insisted.

“There’s a lot we don’t like about this agreement, but the backstop means we would indefinitely be trapped.”

The EU has insisted the backstop is no longer up for discussion, however, meaning Mr Baker’s strategy would be unlikely to bear fruit — although, as he would be content to accept No Deal rather than a bad deal, this would perhaps cause him less consternation than it causes the Remainers who have been in charge of Brexit up to now.

“The House of Commons, I’m afraid, has proven itself to be weak and incompetent, there’s people saying they want to leave the European Union, rejecting the deal, rejecting the deal, rejecting all the alternatives, rejecting… contingency arrangements,” he blasted, referring to the so-called “indicative votes” in which MPs rejected every Brexit option put to them.

He insisted he had not voted against Brexit by rejecting the deal, saying it was not a Brexit “worth having”.

“People aren’t fools, there’s normal people following these issues coming up to me and thanking me for voting this deal down. No, this was a rotten deal for the UK, triple-locking us into the institutions. It was as little Brexit as possible; it appears to be designed to facilitate us going back in later, and so we’ve rejected it,” he explained.

“That’s why the backstop needs to change because it’s the one thing that was indefinite. If we can change it so it’s not indefinite then we could potentially vote for it and move on,” he concluded.

He added that he would not resign from the Tory party, as previously suggested, as he had a duty to his constituency association to hold his seat as a Conservative Party MP.

UPDATE 1830 — Nigel Farage’s speech to the Brexit Betrayal Protest

Nigel Farage has told crowds that he will fight the European Parliament elections, should the UK be forced into contesting them by a lengthy Brexit delay.

Striking an optimistic note on a day where the Brexit vote has been betrayed and many may be feeling somewhat downcast, the Brexit leader told the crowd:

I can’t think of any time in history, where a greater betrayal of a democratic vote has ever happened in the Western world, and they can tonight over there content themselves because they think they’re winning. But that’s because they live in the Westminster bubble. We’re the real people of this country, and we know that the referendum was the first of many great victories.

UPDATE 1538 — EU’s Executive Arm: ‘No Deal Now Likely Scenario’

The European Commission has said that in light of today’s vote, “a ‘no deal’ on 12 April is now a likely scenario.”

In terms that Eurocrats may believe are a threat to the UK — but to be welcomed by those who want the will of the British people honoured — the bloc said that it is ready for a no deal exit on April 12. They have tweeted their full statement:

"No-deal” scenario on 12 April is now a likely scenario. The EU has been preparing for this since 12/2017. Now fully prepared. We will remain united.

UPDATE 1530 — The Fishing For Leave Boat has arrived in Westminster

The Leave Means Leave march from Sunderland to London has arrived in London, and a rally led by Nigel Farage and other leading Brexiteers is due to take place in Parliament Square in little under an hours time.

A particular feature of this march has been a traditional style fishing boat carried south on the back of a truck, in the style of a funeral carriage. It now appears to have arrived in Westminster and is outside the Parliamentary estate now.

UPDATE 1525 — Leader of Failing Pro-EU Party Vince Cable Calls for Second Referendum

Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable has echoed the calls of other Remainers for another referendum after Parliament voted against Mrs May’s ‘deal’, after it had voted to rule out a clean, no deal exit, saying “The only route to resolve the crisis is a final say with the option to Remain in the EU.”

“A long extension to Article 50 is now clearly needed, and a People’s Vote is the best way to persuade European leaders to agree one,” he added.

UPDATE 1523 — Britain’s Oldest Conservative Think Tank the Bow Group Condemns those Tories Who Sold out to Vote for May’s Failing ‘Deal’

Chairman of the Bow Group Ben Harris-Quinney told Breitbart London:

Several weeks ago several intermediaries were being used by Number 10 to reach out to Brexit supporting groups including the Bow Group to ask us to support May’s deal. Some like Matthew Elliott capitulated under unclear conditions, but our demands were clear: The Bow Group will only support a withdrawal agreement that restores all sovereign powers to the United Kingdom, that comes alongside widespread democratic reforms within the Conservative Party so that candidates and leaders are elected not selected, and a strong immigration White Paper. The response from Number 10 was that none of these conditions would even be considered, but that we should support the deal anyway. I have never encountered such arrogance and catastrophic miscalculation of the realpolitik of a situation. There was a pig-headed unwillingness by Number 10 to wake up to the political reality. Instead they have made fools of themselves and by extension this country with their childlike misunderstanding of political reality. The membership of the Conservative Party will no doubt wish to investigate how these amateurs came to unaccountably lead what was once the greatest political party in Britain. As for the way forward for Brexit, unless an acceptable withdrawal agreement is presented we believe the best course to deliver the Brexit that was on the ballot is a no deal/WTO scenario on April 12th. Potential Conservative leadership candidates like Michael Gove and Boris Johnson, who by their own admission are not conservatives and have not been long-term Brexiteers, have done their leadership ambitions huge damage – Both in supporting May’s deal because of its betrayal of Brexit, but also their naive miscalculation of of how things were likely to play out in the Chamber today. The Bow Group is immensely proud of our Senior Patrons Sir John Redwood and Sir Bill Cash who have shown great calm under pressure to honestly stick to their principles not only today, but throughout their long political careers. It so happens to be our President Lord Tebbit’s birthday today, and we wish him many happy returns in a life that has also been underwritten by unwavering principle. The same can be said for almost all those Tory MPs who voted against this betrayal of Brexit. In a time when faith in politics is at an all time low, it is an honour to stand alongside the incorruptible torch bearers of the true spirit of the Conservative Party, however few of them remain.

UPDATE 1510 — Time for change?

Leave.EU, the larger of the two major Brexit campaign during the EU referendum in 2016, close to Nigel Farage, has welcomed the defeat of Mrs May’s deal, and called for her to step down and make way for “a proper leader who believes in Brexit” and will deliver a WTO, or No Deal, Brexit.

Another whopping defeat for May's surrender document and now she's talking about a long delay to Brexit. Time for her to resign so we can get a proper leader who believes in Brexit. We must go WTO! — Leave.EU (@LeaveEUOfficial) March 29, 2019

28 Brexiteer Tory “Spartans” voted against the Withdrawal Agreement, including former Brexit minister Steve Baker, European Research Group (ERG) Vice Chairman Mark Francois, and veteran eurosceptic Sir Bill Cash.

UPDATE 1509 — Dominic Grieve revives Remainer hopes for a Second Referendum in wake of third May defeat

Mr Grieve, who is potentially facing deselection in his own constituency, reminded that with the Remainer-dominated House of Commons voting down leaving in a clean, no deal Brexit he sees room for a second referendum.

The former attorney-general said, “My view has always been that whatever deal we get we should go back to the electorate and ask them” with the options being accepting May’s deal and staying in the EU.

UPDATE, 1507 — Sky News cites EU sources mooting no deal Brexit

The European Commission, the unelected executive which has been leading the Brexit negotiations for the EU, has said it now believes a No Deal break with the United Kingdom on April 12th is a “likely scenario” — despite majority opposition to this by British politicians, and a widespread expectation that the European Council will offer the UK a long delay to Brexit, possibly to April 2020.

The European Commission says a 'no-deal' Brexit on Friday 12 April is now a "likely scenario" — Sky News Breaking (@SkyNewsBreak) March 29, 2019

A full, no deal Brexit isn’t without friends in the United Kingdom despite the deep animosity towards it from the House of Commons, however. As reported by Breitbart London this morning, a respected economist and former governor of the Bank of England Mervyn King dismissed the claims of so-called project fear, and criticised politicians for having a collective “nervous breakdown” over Brexit.

Speaking to the BBC Friday morning, Lord King said:

My own personal preference would be to go back to Europe and say we have a clear strategy which is we want to leave without a deal. But we would like to take six months to complete the preparations to avoid the dislocation… I would like to see us say that we will leave without a deal, a certain distance ahead, which would give the country time to make those preparations and then I think we’d be in a much stronger situation.

UPDATE 1500 — What does this mean?

The United Kingdom has now defaulted to a clean, No Deal exit on the new April 12th deadline agreed at the European Council meeting where the Prime Minister agreed an extension of the Article 50 negotiating period with the bloc, but it seems likely that a Remainer-dominated House of Commons clearly opposed to No Deal will not allow this to happen.

“The implication of the House’s decision is now grave,” the Prime Minister told the House. “[There] is not enough time to agree legislature and ratify a deal and the House has voted to not leave without a deal and so we will have to agree an alternative way forward,” she observed.

MPs will now hold a new round of so-called “indicative votes” on Monday, to tease out a possible way forward.

The last of these ended in stalemates, with the House rejecting all possible options, including No Deal, revocation of Article 50, and a public vote on Mrs May’s deal.

UPDATE 1454 — European Elections now loom on the horizon

Speaking to Sky News, Independent Group (now Change UK Party, as of today) spokesman Chukka Umunna discusses preparing to field candidates for potential European Parliament elections which may now take place in May. No doubt, several other parties — including Nigel Farage’s new Brexit party, will be thinking the same way after the vote.

UPDATE 1451 — EU to convene an emergency meeting to respond

President of the European Council Donald Tusk has announced that he will be calling a meeting of the European Council on April 10th in response to the failure of Mrs May’s deal — two day’s before the new deadline for a No Deal exit.

UPDATE 1450 — The Prime Minister responds

Getting to her feet after the vote, the Prime Minister said:

The implication of the House’s decision is now grave. The legal default is the United Kingdom is to leave the European Union on the 12th of Aprill. That is not enough time to agree legislature and ratify a deal and the House has voted to not leave without a deal and so we will have to agree an alternative way forward. The European Union has been clear than any further extension will need to have a clear purpose and be agreed unanimously by the 27 heads of state before the 12th of April. It is now almost certain to involve the UK being required to hold European Parliament elections. On Monday this House will continue to see if there is majority for a particular future relationship with the EU. I fear we are reaching the limits of the options of this House. This House has rejected no deal, this House has rejected no brexit on Wednesday. It rejected all the variations of the deal on the table and have rejected the withdrawal on its own. This government will continue to press the case for an orderly brexit that the result of the referendum demands.

Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn hits back, saying the Prime Minister should leave office and hold a general election. Interestingly he also states that today is the third vote on May’s deal — a truth unspoken by the government as part of the pretence to get the Withdrawal Agreement before parliament again in face of the Speaker’s ban on bringing the same legislation repeatedly.

UPDATE 1442 — Government defeated 344 — 286

As expected, the House has voted against the government’s Brexit ‘deal’ for the third time, falling short by 58 votes. The Prime Minister says this means the United Kingdom is on course to leave the European Union on April 12th without a deal — but acknowledges the Commons will not permit this happening.

The country will have to hold European Union elections in the month of May, therefore. If a real ‘no-deal’ Brexit is a nightmare for Parliament, then holding elections the mainstream parties are likely to be hammered at must come a close second.

UPDATE 1427 — Bercow announces divisions

After a morning of speeches in the chamber, including an impassioned speech by the Prime Minister in defence of her deal, the Speaker of the House has called divisions — meaning members have gone to the lobbies to vote. We can expect a result in 15 to 20 minutes.

Defending her deal against the persistent feeling that her Brexit settlement with Europe is no real Brexit at all, the Prime Minister appeared to plead with the house, telling them voting for her deal is the “the last opportunity to guarantee Brexit”.

The Prime Minister said:

Today’s motion is not about a blind breit is it a guarantee to brexit today we can give the public and business the certainty they need today.Today we can show we can stand by our word. Today we can come together in the national interest Today we can take a step forward together this is a difficult day for mema crso the house by asking member to take a hard decision and asking some honourable members to vote for a brexit that is less than they hoped for and that is not east. I’m asking the opposition to deliver on instruction of British people and that is not easy either.” I have said I am prepared to leave this job earlier than intended to secure the right outcome for our country and when the devision bell rings in a few moments’ time, everyone one of us will have to look into our hearts to see what is right for our constituencies and our country.

How did we get here?

By Jack Montgomery

Before now, the prime minister had assured Leave voters that “no deal is better than a bad deal” and promised no less than 108 times that the UK would be leaving the EU, come what may, on March 29th 2019.

However, after the Withdrawal Agreement she negotiated with the bloc — allegedly behind the backs of ministers at the Brexiteer-led Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU) — was rejected by Parliament twice, she reversed course, asking the European Council for an extension of the two-year Article 50 exit negotiations commenced in 2017, over the objections of Tory activists and most of her own MPs.

The EU granted the Tory leader a shorter stay of execution than she was asking for, and MPs must vote today for her agreement so Britain can leave the EU under its terms on May 22nd.

If they do not, the country defaults to a No Deal exit on April 12th — although it is widely expected that the Remain-dominated House of Commons would move swiftly to prevent this, instead forcing the Government to request a much longer extension, with or without Mrs May, with the EU reportedly ready to push exit deadline all the way to April Fools’ Day in 2020.

What happens if the deal does pass?

If the deal does make it through the House of Commons somehow, it is likely that the United Kingdom will leave the EU under its terms on May 22nd — at least in name.

Britain would not participate in the European Parliament elections in May, and would lose its MEPs and European Council representation, but would remain an EU member in all other respects until the end of a so-called “transition period” in which negotiations between the British government — under new leadership, assuming Mrs May keeps her promise to stand down — and Brussels.

If no future partnership is agreed during this transition, which could last all the way to the end of December 2022, the deal makes provisions for the so-called “backstop” to come into force, with Great Britain (England, Scotland, and Wales) being incorporated into an EU-controlled “single customs territory”, while Northern Ireland would be effectively annexed into the EU Customs Union and Single Market proper.

This is considered an unacceptable outcome by virtually all sides of the Brexit debate, and the deal does not allow for Britain to break the arrangement without the EU’s permission — leading to fears that Remainers will simply reopen the question of whether the UK should simply revert seamlessly to full EU membership once the transition is over.

Do we know what will happen next if the deal does not pass?

Legally, the United Kingdom should simply leave the EU cleanly on April 12th on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms if the deal does not pass — otherwise known as a “No Deal” or “Hard” Brexit.

However, this was also supposed to be the cast for March 29th, and the British government, Parliament, and European Union instead contrived for Brexit to be delayed.

It is expected that the same thing will happen if the deal fails today, with the overwhelming majority of MPs voting to reject a No Deal Brexit in a series of “indicative votes”.

However, MPs also voted against every other alternative, including pushing for an even weaker form of Brexit, holding another referendum, and revoking Article 50 — which would essentially cancel the Brexit process.

This leaves the country in an invidious position, where a Leave-supporting populace is served by a Remain-supporting Parliament which has voted against every available Brexit, and where no party commands an overall majority.

A long extension, as the EU has been pushing for with increasing confidence, seems to be the inevitable outcome, assuming the bloc itself does not force a No Deal — as some Brexiteers have been hoping.

This would likely mean Britain would have to participate in the European Parliament elections in May — an event which could serve as something of a proxy second referendum, with parties opposed to Brexit facing off against Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party and Gerard Batten’s UKIP — and a British general election, in which the Tories would likely be under new management.

What strategy for Brexit the Leaver-backed but Remainer-led party would be putting to the people at such an election, however, is unclear.

This story is developing, more follows


Britain’s House of Commons has voted to reject Theresa May’s so-called Withdrawal Agreement just hours before the nation was supposed to leave the European Union, with or without a deal — a deadline betrayed this week by Parliament after they voted to postpone Brexit months or even years into the future.

Britain’s lawmakers have already voted against the settlement the Prime Minister agreed with the European Union twice, and the government was blocked from bringing it to Parliament again. Yet by splitting the deal into two pieces, the ‘Brexit in name only‘ apparently comes before Parliament again as a different vote in spirit only.

UPDATE 1830 — Nigel speaks to the rally

Nigel Farage has struck an optimistic note on this day of Brexit betrayal, telling the Parliament square rally:

I can’t think of any time in history, where a greater betrayal of a democratic vote has ever happened in the Western world, and they can tonight over there content themselves because they think they’re winning. But that’s because they live in the Westminster bubble. We’re the real people of this country, and we know that the referendum was the first of many great victories. We will get our country back, we will get out independence back, we will get out pride and self-respect back. We are going to win!

UPDATE 1710 — May meets cabinet members

The Prime Minister is reportedly meeting with a delegation of Cabinet ministers, who are thought to be urging her to adopt an even weaker form of Brexit than the one outlined in the seemingly abandoned Political Declaration which formerly accompanied the thrice-defeated Withdrawal Agreement, possibly involving full membership of the EU Customs Union, or “a” customs union which would have the same practical effect.

This would almost certainly kill any chance of the United Kingdom being able to strike new trade deals with countries like the United States, Australia, and New Zealand after Brexit, and leave the EU able to barter access to British markets without Britain’s political representatives having any say in the matter while striking its own trade deals.

Meanwhile, Nigel Farage is enjoying the crowds in Parliament Square…

UPDATE 1705 — EU’s Brexit Negotiator Floats Upgrading May’s ‘Worst Deal Ever’ to ‘Worst Deal Ever Plus Customs Union’

In comments reported by politico.eu, Michel Barnier suggested that the EU he was open to a deal which would mean the UK would maintain the same tariffs and trade policies as the EU, appealing to Remainer parliamentarians who want to stop a clean break.

“We are ready to be even more ambitious should the U.K.’s red-lines evolve. For instance, we are open to work on the principle of a permanent customs union should the U.K. decide to take this path,” Mr Barnier said at the College of Europe campus in Warsaw, Poland.

However, Barnier added, “Let me be frank: Without a positive choice, the default option would be a no-deal, which has become more likely. It was never our scenario, but the EU27 is now prepared.”

UPDATE 1650 — Tory Brexiteer cautions against optimism

Veteran Tory MP Michael Fabricant has warned that, “If #Brexiteers think that a victory has been won, because #Remainers and #Labour voted down the #Deal, think again.”

Mr Fabricant, a Brexiteer himself, who backed the deal with some reluctance, predicted that “On Monday, the #Remainer Parliament will try to keep us in the Customs Union which means our obeying #EU legislation and having no say in making them. Worse than [before]”.

However, the deal would have involved also have involved a “transition period” lasting to the end of December 2022 in which Britain would have essentially remained a full member of the European Union, minus its representation in the EU institutions — with Remainers able to push for a switch back to formal membership at the end of it if the despised backstop remained the only deal on offer.

UPDATE 1625 — Europe mouthpiece Ireland talks up long Brexit delay

Irish taoiseach (prime minister) Leo Varadkar is set for to meet with Germany’s Angela Merkel and France’s Emmanuel Macron for crunch talks in the wake of the Withdrawal Agreement’s rejection.

“These two meetings reflect the deep and warm relations Ireland enjoys with both France and Germany, including the support shown to Ireland during the Brexit negotiations,” said a spokesman for the Irish leader, who has been extremely combative throughout the EU’s talks with the British, despite his country’s heavy economic dependence on trade both with and via the United Kingdom, and the enormous blow which would fall on it in the event of No Deal.

“The [Irish] Government notes the decision of the House of Commons to reject the indicative Withdrawal Agreement. It is now up to the UK to indicate how it plans to proceed in order to avoid a No Deal scenario,” the taoiseach remarked in a separate statement on the British vote.

“We must be open to a long extension, should the United Kingdom decide to fundamentally reconsider its approach to Brexit,” he added.

UPDATE 1610 — In other news…

The Independent Group have chosen today to rebrand themselves as a political party in time, they hope, to challenge the potential European Parliament elections in May.

To the amusement of some on social media, they have chosen to call themselves the Change UK party — odd, given they are campaigning to keep things the same. Read more on Breitbart London:

UPDATE 1605 — Sir Bernard Jenkin: There are only 160 MPs who really believe in leaving the European Union

Saying that the most likely outcome of today’s developments was a longer extension, Sir Bernard said, “This only arises because there are about 160 MPs in parliament who really believe in leaving the European Union and the withdrawal agreement we ended up with was negotiated in such a way as to keep us poised to rejoin at some stage.

On Prime Minister Theresa May’s successor, the Tory Brexiteer said, “I think it’s important to have somebody that has the confidence of the whole party and we don’t have another kind of coronation like we had last time.

“I think the membership of the party must have the final choice and that makes its very likely we end up with someone who supports leave the European Union.

“We can’t have another prime minister who says she wants to leave the European Union and respects the result when they don’t believe in that project… putting someone in charge of a project they don’t believe in doesn’t work as we’ve learnt.”

Sir Bernard echoes the sentiments of former Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith who said told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme this morning, “We want the second phase [of Brexit negotiations] to be led by someone who passionately believes in what 17.4 million people voted for, which was to leave the European Union.”

“Now is the time for a new set of hands with a proper professional team that actually believes in Brexit and gets us through the next phase,” Mr Duncan Smith added.

UPDATE 1556 — Pro-Brexit demonstrators gathering outside Parliament

Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage has welcomed the defeat of Mrs May’s deal, but warned that it appears there are now fresh battles ahead for Brexiteers.

“The new EU treaty has been rightly defeated for a third time. Extension and further battles now seem inevitable,” he observed, vowing: “We are not downhearted, and will fight them again”

UPDATE 1542 — Diehard Brexiteer gives his reasoning

Steve Baker MP, the former Brexit minister and Deputy Chairman of the European Research Group (ERG) who voted against the Withdrawal Agreement, has revealed that he wrestled with whether or not to back it until the last minute.

“As late as last night I was sitting in the library here writing an article on how I was going to be forced to vote for the agreement, because in the Commons we’re beaten on the numbers,” he confessed.

“But I just realised I’m not going to surrender; it’s a rotten deal for the UK, the voters know it, they’re here today telling me so, and I concluded I’m never going to surrender to vote for this deal and this backstop,” he told Sky News.

He also reiterated his near-instantaneous call for Mrs May to go in the wake of her defeat, saying she had “used up all her political capital” in her failed efforts to get the deal over the line.

“Really, it is time to accept that this deal’s not going through, it is no good [to] keep following the same path, so I would like the Government to go to this [European] Council which has been announced [on April 10th] and ask for changes on the backstop,” he insisted.

“There’s a lot we don’t like about this agreement, but the backstop means we would indefinitely be trapped.”

The EU has insisted the backstop is no longer up for discussion, however, meaning Mr Baker’s strategy would be unlikely to bear fruit — although, as he would be content to accept No Deal rather than a bad deal, this would perhaps cause him less consternation than it causes the Remainers who have been in charge of Brexit up to now.

“The House of Commons, I’m afraid, has proven itself to be weak and incompetent, there’s people saying they want to leave the European Union, rejecting the deal, rejecting the deal, rejecting all the alternatives, rejecting… contingency arrangements,” he blasted, referring to the so-called “indicative votes” in which MPs rejected every Brexit option put to them.

He insisted he had not voted against Brexit by rejecting the deal, saying it was not a Brexit “worth having”.

“People aren’t fools, there’s normal people following these issues coming up to me and thanking me for voting this deal down. No, this was a rotten deal for the UK, triple-locking us into the institutions. It was as little Brexit as possible; it appears to be designed to facilitate us going back in later, and so we’ve rejected it,” he explained.

“That’s why the backstop needs to change because it’s the one thing that was indefinite. If we can change it so it’s not indefinite then we could potentially vote for it and move on,” he concluded.

He added that he would not resign from the Tory party, as previously suggested, as he had a duty to his constituency association to hold his seat as a Conservative Party MP.

UPDATE 1830 — Nigel Farage’s speech to the Brexit Betrayal Protest

Nigel Farage has told crowds that he will fight the European Parliament elections, should the UK be forced into contesting them by a lengthy Brexit delay.

Striking an optimistic note on a day where the Brexit vote has been betrayed and many may be feeling somewhat downcast, the Brexit leader told the crowd:

I can’t think of any time in history, where a greater betrayal of a democratic vote has ever happened in the Western world, and they can tonight over there content themselves because they think they’re winning. But that’s because they live in the Westminster bubble. We’re the real people of this country, and we know that the referendum was the first of many great victories. We will get our country back, we will get out independence back, we will get out pride and self-respect back. We are going to win!

UPDATE 1538 — EU’s Executive Arm: ‘No Deal Now Likely Scenario’

The European Commission has said that in light of today’s vote, “a ‘no deal’ on 12 April is now a likely scenario.”

In terms that Eurocrats may believe are a threat to the UK — but to be welcomed by those who want the will of the British people honoured — the bloc said that it is ready for a no deal exit on April 12. They have tweeted their full statement:

"No-deal” scenario on 12 April is now a likely scenario. The EU has been preparing for this since 12/2017. Now fully prepared. We will remain united.

UPDATE 1530 — The Fishing For Leave Boat has arrived in Westminster

The Leave Means Leave march from Sunderland to London has arrived in London, and a rally led by Nigel Farage and other leading Brexiteers is due to take place in Parliament Square in little under an hours time.

A particular feature of this march has been a traditional style fishing boat carried south on the back of a truck, in the style of a funeral carriage. It now appears to have arrived in Westminster and is outside the Parliamentary estate now.

UPDATE 1525 — Leader of Failing Pro-EU Party Vince Cable Calls for Second Referendum

Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable has echoed the calls of other Remainers for another referendum after Parliament voted against Mrs May’s ‘deal’, after it had voted to rule out a clean, no deal exit, saying “The only route to resolve the crisis is a final say with the option to Remain in the EU.”

“A long extension to Article 50 is now clearly needed, and a People’s Vote is the best way to persuade European leaders to agree one,” he added.

UPDATE 1523 — Britain’s Oldest Conservative Think Tank the Bow Group Condemns those Tories Who Sold out to Vote for May’s Failing ‘Deal’

Chairman of the Bow Group Ben Harris-Quinney told Breitbart London:

Several weeks ago several intermediaries were being used by Number 10 to reach out to Brexit supporting groups including the Bow Group to ask us to support May’s deal. Some like Matthew Elliott capitulated under unclear conditions, but our demands were clear: The Bow Group will only support a withdrawal agreement that restores all sovereign powers to the United Kingdom, that comes alongside widespread democratic reforms within the Conservative Party so that candidates and leaders are elected not selected, and a strong immigration White Paper. The response from Number 10 was that none of these conditions would even be considered, but that we should support the deal anyway. I have never encountered such arrogance and catastrophic miscalculation of the realpolitik of a situation. There was a pig-headed unwillingness by Number 10 to wake up to the political reality. Instead they have made fools of themselves and by extension this country with their childlike misunderstanding of political reality. The membership of the Conservative Party will no doubt wish to investigate how these amateurs came to unaccountably lead what was once the greatest political party in Britain. As for the way forward for Brexit, unless an acceptable withdrawal agreement is presented we believe the best course to deliver the Brexit that was on the ballot is a no deal/WTO scenario on April 12th. Potential Conservative leadership candidates like Michael Gove and Boris Johnson, who by their own admission are not conservatives and have not been long-term Brexiteers, have done their leadership ambitions huge damage – Both in supporting May’s deal because of its betrayal of Brexit, but also their naive miscalculation of of how things were likely to play out in the Chamber today. The Bow Group is immensely proud of our Senior Patrons Sir John Redwood and Sir Bill Cash who have shown great calm under pressure to honestly stick to their principles not only today, but throughout their long political careers. It so happens to be our President Lord Tebbit’s birthday today, and we wish him many happy returns in a life that has also been underwritten by unwavering principle. The same can be said for almost all those Tory MPs who voted against this betrayal of Brexit. In a time when faith in politics is at an all time low, it is an honour to stand alongside the incorruptible torch bearers of the true spirit of the Conservative Party, however few of them remain.

UPDATE 1510 — Time for change?

Leave.EU, the larger of the two major Brexit campaign during the EU referendum in 2016, close to Nigel Farage, has welcomed the defeat of Mrs May’s deal, and called for her to step down and make way for “a proper leader who believes in Brexit” and will deliver a WTO, or No Deal, Brexit.

UPDATE 1509 — Dominic Grieve revives Remainer hopes for a Second Referendum in wake of third May defeat

Mr Grieve, who is potentially facing deselection in his own constituency, reminded that with the Remainer-dominated House of Commons voting down leaving in a clean, no deal Brexit he sees room for a second referendum.

The former attorney-general said, “My view has always been that whatever deal we get we should go back to the electorate and ask them” with the options being accepting May’s deal and staying in the EU.

UPDATE, 1507 — Sky News cites EU sources mooting no deal Brexit

The European Commission, the unelected executive which has been leading the Brexit negotiations for the EU, has said it now believes a No Deal break with the United Kingdom on April 12th is a “likely scenario” — despite majority opposition to this by British politicians, and a widespread expectation that the European Council will offer the UK a long delay to Brexit, possibly to April 2020.

The European Commission says a 'no-deal' Brexit on Friday 12 April is now a "likely scenario" — Sky News Breaking (@SkyNewsBreak) March 29, 2019

A full, no deal Brexit isn’t without friends in the United Kingdom despite the deep animosity towards it from the House of Commons, however. As reported by Breitbart London this morning, a respected economist and former governor of the Bank of England Mervyn King dismissed the claims of so-called project fear, and criticised politicians for having a collective “nervous breakdown” over Brexit.

Speaking to the BBC Friday morning, Lord King said:

My own personal preference would be to go back to Europe and say we have a clear strategy which is we want to leave without a deal. But we would like to take six months to complete the preparations to avoid the dislocation… I would like to see us say that we will leave without a deal, a certain distance ahead, which would give the country time to make those preparations and then I think we’d be in a much stronger situation.

UPDATE 1500 — What does this mean?

The United Kingdom has now defaulted to a clean, No Deal exit on the new April 12th deadline agreed at the European Council meeting where the Prime Minister agreed an extension of the Article 50 negotiating period with the bloc, but it seems likely that a Remainer-dominated House of Commons clearly opposed to No Deal will not allow this to happen.

“The implication of the House’s decision is now grave,” the Prime Minister told the House. “[There] is not enough time to agree legislature and ratify a deal and the House has voted to not leave without a deal and so we will have to agree an alternative way forward,” she observed.

MPs will now hold a new round of so-called “indicative votes” on Monday, to tease out a possible way forward.

The last of these ended in stalemates, with the House rejecting all possible options, including No Deal, revocation of Article 50, and a public vote on Mrs May’s deal.

UPDATE 1454 — European Elections now loom on the horizon

Speaking to Sky News, Independent Group (now Change UK Party, as of today) spokesman Chukka Umunna discusses preparing to field candidates for potential European Parliament elections which may now take place in May. No doubt, several other parties — including Nigel Farage’s new Brexit party, will be thinking the same way after the vote.

UPDATE 1451 — EU to convene an emergency meeting to respond

President of the European Council Donald Tusk has announced that he will be calling a meeting of the European Council on April 10th in response to the failure of Mrs May’s deal — two day’s before the new deadline for a No Deal exit.

In view of the rejection of the Withdrawal Agreement by the House of Commons, I have decided to call a European Council on 10 April. #Brexit — Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) March 29, 2019

UPDATE 1450 — The Prime Minister responds

Getting to her feet after the vote, the Prime Minister said:

The implication of the House’s decision is now grave. The legal default is the United Kingdom is to leave the European Union on the 12th of Aprill. That is not enough time to agree legislature and ratify a deal and the House has voted to not leave without a deal and so we will have to agree an alternative way forward. The European Union has been clear than any further extension will need to have a clear purpose and be agreed unanimously by the 27 heads of state before the 12th of April. It is now almost certain to involve the UK being required to hold European Parliament elections. On Monday this House will continue to see if there is majority for a particular future relationship with the EU. I fear we are reaching the limits of the options of this House. This House has rejected no deal, this House has rejected no brexit on Wednesday. It rejected all the variations of the deal on the table and have rejected the withdrawal on its own. This government will continue to press the case for an orderly brexit that the result of the referendum demands.

Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn hits back, saying the Prime Minister should leave office and hold a general election. Interestingly he also states that today is the third vote on May’s deal — a truth unspoken by the government as part of the pretence to get the Withdrawal Agreement before parliament again in face of the Speaker’s ban on bringing the same legislation repeatedly.

UPDATE 1442 — Government defeated 344 — 286

As expected, the House has voted against the government’s Brexit ‘deal’ for the third time, falling short by 58 votes. The Prime Minister says this means the United Kingdom is on course to leave the European Union on April 12th without a deal — but acknowledges the Commons will not permit this happening.

The country will have to hold European Union elections in the month of May, therefore. If a real ‘no-deal’ Brexit is a nightmare for Parliament, then holding elections the mainstream parties are likely to be hammered at must come a close second.

UPDATE 1427 — Bercow announces divisions

After a morning of speeches in the chamber, including an impassioned speech by the Prime Minister in defence of her deal, the Speaker of the House has called divisions — meaning members have gone to the lobbies to vote. We can expect a result in 15 to 20 minutes.

Defending her deal against the persistent feeling that her Brexit settlement with Europe is no real Brexit at all, the Prime Minister appeared to plead with the house, telling them voting for her deal is the “the last opportunity to guarantee Brexit”.

The Prime Minister said:

Today’s motion is not about a blind breit is it a guarantee to brexit today we can give the public and business the certainty they need today.Today we can show we can stand by our word. Today we can come together in the national interest Today we can take a step forward together this is a difficult day for mema crso the house by asking member to take a hard decision and asking some honourable members to vote for a brexit that is less than they hoped for and that is not east. I’m asking the opposition to deliver on instruction of British people and that is not easy either.” I have said I am prepared to leave this job earlier than intended to secure the right outcome for our country and when the devision bell rings in a few moments’ time, everyone one of us will have to look into our hearts to see what is right for our constituencies and our country.

How did we get here?

By Jack Montgomery

Before now, the prime minister had assured Leave voters that “no deal is better than a bad deal” and promised no less than 108 times that the UK would be leaving the EU, come what may, on March 29th 2019.

However, after the Withdrawal Agreement she negotiated with the bloc — allegedly behind the backs of ministers at the Brexiteer-led Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU) — was rejected by Parliament twice, she reversed course, asking the European Council for an extension of the two-year Article 50 exit negotiations commenced in 2017, over the objections of Tory activists and most of her own MPs.

The EU granted the Tory leader a shorter stay of execution than she was asking for, and MPs must vote today for her agreement so Britain can leave the EU under its terms on May 22nd.

If they do not, the country defaults to a No Deal exit on April 12th — although it is widely expected that the Remain-dominated House of Commons would move swiftly to prevent this, instead forcing the Government to request a much longer extension, with or without Mrs May, with the EU reportedly ready to push exit deadline all the way to April Fools’ Day in 2020.

What happens if the deal does pass?

If the deal does make it through the House of Commons somehow, it is likely that the United Kingdom will leave the EU under its terms on May 22nd — at least in name.

Britain would not participate in the European Parliament elections in May, and would lose its MEPs and European Council representation, but would remain an EU member in all other respects until the end of a so-called “transition period” in which negotiations between the British government — under new leadership, assuming Mrs May keeps her promise to stand down — and Brussels.

If no future partnership is agreed during this transition, which could last all the way to the end of December 2022, the deal makes provisions for the so-called “backstop” to come into force, with Great Britain (England, Scotland, and Wales) being incorporated into an EU-controlled “single customs territory”, while Northern Ireland would be effectively annexed into the EU Customs Union and Single Market proper.

This is considered an unacceptable outcome by virtually all sides of the Brexit debate, and the deal does not allow for Britain to break the arrangement without the EU’s permission — leading to fears that Remainers will simply reopen the question of whether the UK should simply revert seamlessly to full EU membership once the transition is over.

Do we know what will happen next if the deal does not pass?

Legally, the United Kingdom should simply leave the EU cleanly on April 12th on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms if the deal does not pass — otherwise known as a “No Deal” or “Hard” Brexit.

However, this was also supposed to be the cast for March 29th, and the British government, Parliament, and European Union instead contrived for Brexit to be delayed.

It is expected that the same thing will happen if the deal fails today, with the overwhelming majority of MPs voting to reject a No Deal Brexit in a series of “indicative votes”.

However, MPs also voted against every other alternative, including pushing for an even weaker form of Brexit, holding another referendum, and revoking Article 50 — which would essentially cancel the Brexit process.

This leaves the country in an invidious position, where a Leave-supporting populace is served by a Remain-supporting Parliament which has voted against every available Brexit, and where no party commands an overall majority.

A long extension, as the EU has been pushing for with increasing confidence, seems to be the inevitable outcome, assuming the bloc itself does not force a No Deal — as some Brexiteers have been hoping.

This would likely mean Britain would have to participate in the European Parliament elections in May — an event which could serve as something of a proxy second referendum, with parties opposed to Brexit facing off against Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party and Gerard Batten’s UKIP — and a British general election, in which the Tories would likely be under new management.

What strategy for Brexit the Leaver-backed but Remainer-led party would be putting to the people at such an election, however, is unclear.

President Donald Trump issued an executive order on Tuesday directing the federal government to prepare a coordinated response plan in the event of an electromagnetic pulse attack (EMP). The order described the enormous damage such an attack could cause and noted the U.S. government currently lacks a coherent plan of action for responding to one.

The minimal media coverage given to Trump’s order was bizarrely contemptuous, as though he had just issued an order to prepare defenses against flying saucers or flesh-eating zombies. The Washington Post headline was “Trump issued an executive order to prepare for an EMP attack. What is it, and should you worry?”

The Post answered its own question with the subhead, “Nah. But the U.S. should get ready for a very similar threat – from the sun.”

Other publications dismissed the EMP threat as “mythical” or mere science fiction, even though the phenomenon of electromagnetic energy from a nuclear detonation interfering with electronics and power transmission systems is far better established than “climate change,” which many of these same publications vehemently insist is not mythical at all and must be fought immediately at unlimited cost in money and human lives.

Perhaps some of those criticizing Trump for his executive order believe it will pave the way for recommendations as deranged and extreme as those frequently demanded for climate change. Trump’s order is nothing like the “Green New Deal,” however. It simply instructs federal agencies to prepare evaluations and submit reports by certain fixed deadlines. Telling federal bureaucrats to file some reports is hardly a stunning break with executive precedent.

It should be noted that some of the publications hammering Trump for issuing his EMP executive order found it quite charming when the Obama administration really did prepare response plans for flesh-eating zombie attacks, using multiple federal agencies. This tomfoolery was justified on the grounds that it made training exercises fun and captured the imagination of the public.

Anti-Trump animus obviously drives much of the derogatory coverage, along with heavy media bias against the people and organizations who have been warning about EMP weapons for years. It pleases critics to imagine the EMP threat is a mindless obsession of paranoids and doomsday preppers, even though the technology to generate electromagnetic pulses definitely exists and their effect on delicate electronic systems would be catastrophic. The threat is “mythical” in the same sense that a massive Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor would have been mythical in November 1941, or terrorists flying hijacked planes into skyscrapers would have mythical in August 2001.

Comparing a targeted EMP strike to solar flares as the Washington Post does is dangerously absurd, but Trump’s executive order does mention natural disruptions in its very first paragraph, so environmental dangers are not overlooked. The order defines electromagnetic pulses as follows:

“Electromagnetic pulse” is a burst of electromagnetic energy. EMPs have the potential to negatively affect technology systems on Earth and in space. A high-altitude EMP (HEMP) is a type of human-made EMP that occurs when a nuclear device is detonated at approximately 40 kilometers or more above the surface of Earth. A geomagnetic disturbance (GMD) is a type of natural EMP driven by a temporary disturbance of Earth’s magnetic field resulting from interactions with solar eruptions. Both HEMPs and GMDs can affect large geographic areas.

The point of the order is that we currently lack a coordinated strategy to deal with any significant disruption of the sensitive equipment our society is almost entirely reliant upon. That equipment has only existed for a few decades, so history offers little precedent for how to deal with a deliberate attack, and no reason to believe natural forces cannot cause disruption on a catastrophic scale.

It is particularly strange to see anyone mocking the White House for taking the matter seriously when Venezuela is currently showing the world a horrifying example of what happens to crowded cities when the lights go out. As a matter of fact, the Venezuelan dictatorship has made laughable attempts at blaming the nationwide blackouts on an EMP attack perpetrated by dissidents with the aid of the U.S. government. A real EMP strike would be orders of magnitude worse than the hardships imposed on Venezuela by socialism.

Trump’s executive order was not extravagant. The actions directed by the White House boil down to asking agency heads to seriously estimate the consequences of EMP attacks on various scales and prepare cogent response plans. Maintaining communications between military units and emergency responders in the event of an EMP was given high priority. Such considerations are essentially why the primordial Internet was created by the Defense Department decades ago. Ironically, our dependence on the Internet makes us more vulnerable to electromagnetic attack than ever.

Concern about attacks on America’s communications and energy infrastructure are not new. Analysts inside and outside the government have been warning about the vulnerability of the power grid to everything from cyber-espionage to brute-force vandalism for many years. Criticizing the Trump administration for getting serious about those vulnerabilities, simply because it dares to imagine the worst-case scenario, is highly irresponsible.

Among those applauding President Trump’s executive order was Dr. Peter Vincent Pry, who noted in The Hill on Thursday that the Congressional EMP Commission has been advising better preparedness for almost 20 years.

Pry, formerly chief of staff for that commission, cited strong bipartisan support for getting serious about EMP defense:

Republican leaders on EMP preparedness have included Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Ted Cruz of Texas, Reps. Doug Lamborn of Colorado and Michael McCaul of Texas, former Reps. Roscoe Bartlett of Maryland and Curt Weldon of Pennsylvania, and Texas state Sen. Bob Hall. Democratic leaders have included former Sen. Jim Webb of Virginia, Sen. Edward Markey of Massachusetts, Reps. Yvette Clarke of New York and Benny Thompson of Mississippi, former Rep. Henry Waxman of California, and former state Reps. Andrea Boland of Maine, Joan Ginal of Colorado and Michelle Rehwinkel Vasilinda of Florida. Aside from President Trump himself, the greatest credit for the EMP Executive Order goes to William R. Graham, chairman of the Congressional EMP Commission since 2001 and former White House science adviser to President Reagan, who ran NASA and was on the defense science team that discovered the EMP phenomenon during the Starfish Prime nuclear test in 1962. Dr. Graham has spent a professional lifetime trying to protect civilization from the existential threat that is EMP.

Pry framed EMP weapons as a subset of cyber warfare, which no one in the right minds would dismiss as a mythical or exaggerated threat, even though large-scale adversary-directed computer warfare hasn’t happened yet either.

As bad as some of the hacks have been over the past few decades, many of them directed by hostile state actors, the world has yet to see anything close to what will happen if a major military power unleashes an all-out cyber warfare campaign against an advanced industrial economy like the United States or Europe. Pry noted the worst-case scenarios for cyber attacks on American infrastructure envision millions of deaths.

One problem with discussing EMP attacks is that worst-case scenarios, like a nuclear device detonated at high altitude above the American heartland, get all the attention. It is easy to denigrate such scenarios as unthinkable, although we obviously have long-standing detailed plans to deal with even more unthinkable nuclear and biological attacks, and the EMP option would seem far more realistic to an assailant with very limited ability to deliver nuclear warheads over intercontinental distances.

Doomsday nationwide EMP attacks are not the only threat to consider, however. We like to think of the Internet as a vast amorphous blob of pulsing data, at once everywhere and nowhere, but in truth it has specific weak spots and hubs that could be hit with small weapons, perhaps well short of nuclear bombs. The damage from a “small” EMP attack on Wall Street or the tech hubs of the West Coast would run into trillions of dollars and could throw the entire U.S. economy into chaos. A glance at the latest grim urban traffic report suggests a small-scale EMP attack that affects just a portion of a single city could inflict thousands of casualties.

The Washington Times speculated on Wednesday that Trump’s executive order could be a step toward overcoming the resistance of private sector companies to spend money on hardening electric grids and computer networks against both natural disasters and sabotage.

The Washington Times also cited a congressional report from January that found hostile nations like China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea are working on developing EMP weapons and have incorporated such weapons into their military doctrines. The U.S. media has been hysterical about Russian espionage and information warfare for years but suddenly thinks President Trump is going overboard by taking the ultimate cyber threat seriously.

Sam Brownback, ambassador-at-large for International Religious Freedom, told a State Department press conference on Thursday he has received reports of U.S. citizens and legal residents imprisoned in China’s re-education camps for Muslims in Xinjiang province.

Brownback, who recently returned from a trip to Asia, spoke out against China’s “increasing aggression towards people of faith.”

“China is at war with faith, but it is a war they will not win,” he said.

Brownback called out Chinese acts of oppression against Muslims, Tibetan Buddhists, and Christians, placing particular emphasis on the “horrific conditions and abuses” in the Xinjiang internment camps where a million Muslims have been held. A number of the prisoners have reportedly died in captivity at what China outrageously describes as “boarding schools” or “vocational training camps.”

Brownback said he received new information about a man with American legal status held in the Xinjiang camps right before the press conference began.

“Just as I walked over here, I received another email from a gentleman in the United States whose father is still in Xinjiang who hasn’t – he’s not been able to reach him for months, 75-year-old man, doesn’t know whether – where he is and whether he’s still alive,” Brownback said.

“If I get verified, this gentleman that I just was reading the email about has legal status in the United States. Now, he’s not a U.S. citizen, but he had legal status being here, traveled back to Xinjiang after being here with his son in California, and then has not been heard from since,” he clarified later in the press conference.

Brownback said the State Department has also received reports about Kazakh, Kyrgyz, and Turkish nationals held in the camps. Most of the Muslims in Xinjiang belong to the Uighur minority, a Turkic ethnic group. Turkey is the only major Islamic power to object to China’s harsh treatment of its Muslim population.

The Trump administration has unquestionably been the most vocal and active defender of Xinjiang’s Muslims. Brownback said on Thursday that the possibility of level sanctions against Chinese officials under the Global Magnitsky Act is still on the table. Sanctioned individuals could include the top Communist Party official in Xinjiang, who played a leading role in the oppression of Tibet before he was put in charge of the Uighur situation.

China would react with fury to any such sanctions, especially if a high official of the Communist Party is targeted. The Chinese government dismisses all action on behalf of Xinjiang’s Muslims as unacceptable interference in its internal affairs.

“Global Magnitsky is handled by Treasury Department, and when people are ready to make announcements, they will,” he said.

The ambassador noted that Chinese officials have not responded to numerous requests by family members in other countries seeking information about missing relatives in Xinjiang. He described a frustrating encounter with Chinese representatives at the United Nations earlier in March:

They claimed at that time – and the story has been morphing over time of what is taking place in Xinjiang – at first they denied anything was happening, nothing’s going on here. And then later they said they were vocational training camps, and that’s what the individual was saying at this time, that these continue to be vocational training camps. To which I said, “I get and have lists of names, hundreds of names that are sent to me that people that can’t find their relatives. Would you please help me find them and tell their relatives where they are?” To which there was no response from the Chinese official.

CNN cited multiple State Department sources on Friday who said they are aware of multiple persons with American legal status held in the Xinjiang camps. One source said the number of such individuals is not large but could provide no additional details due to privacy concerns.

The State Department explained on Thursday that because China “does not recognize dual nationality,” it can be difficult to provide consular services to people with U.S. legal status in China, and they could be “subject to additional scrutiny and harassment.”

Brownback referenced a meeting Secretary of State Mike Pompeo held on Wednesday with a survivor of the Xinjiang camps and the relatives of people who are still incarcerated there. The Uighur survivor, Mihrigul Tursun, said she was separated from her children, held in an overcrowded cell, and tortured with beatings and electrocution. Other Muslim veterans of the camps said China confiscated their Qurans and forced them to violate Islamic dietary laws in an effort to “deprogram” them away from their religion.

“We’re working to convince the Chinese that this practice is abhorrent and ought to be stopped,” Pompeo said on Wednesday.

“China must release all those arbitrarily detained and end its repression,” Pompeo said online after his meeting with the Uighurs. “The world cannot afford China’s shameful hypocrisy toward Muslims. On one hand, China abuses more than a million Muslims at home, but on the other, it protects violent Islamic terrorist groups from sanctions at the U.N.”

The latter comment was a reference to China’s repeated protection of Jaish-e-Mohammad terrorist leader Masood Azhar against sanctions. Jaish-e-Mohammad is the Pakistan-based extremist organization that claimed responsibility for a major attack on Indian troops in the disputed Kashmir province in late February, an incident that brought India and Pakistan to the brink of war.

Rep. Rick Crawford (R-AR) said Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) turned the House Intelligence Committee into “a propaganda organ of the Democrat Party,” offering his remarks in a Friday interview on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Daily with host Alex Marlow.

Crawford said, “I’m sure people like Adam Schiff lay awake at night going, ‘What can we do next to make sure we can’t move past this? What do I have to do I do to perpetuate this Russia collusion hoax?'”

LISTEN:

Crawford said Democrats push the “collusion” narrative in pursuit of partisan political advantage in the lead-up to 2020’s presidential election.

“So that’s why they have to disrupt and redirect and do all these other kinds of things because they’ve got to keep this stuff in the headlines until 2020,” assessed Crawford. “So they’ve formulated a plan to make sure they can continue to keep this theory alive to hopefully propel a Democrat into the White House.”

Crawford added, “Rosenstein was at the center of all this, and they were saying, “President Trump better note fire Rosenstein, because if he does, we’re going to impeach him, and he better not fire Mueller.’ They were counting on Mueller and Rosenstein, who were going to save the republic from the evil Trump, and they were held up as paragons of virtue. They were the guys who were going to get it done because, ‘They’re the only ones we can trust.’ Rosenstein was part of it — in fact, he was pivotal — in this whole narrative, and now, all of a sudden, he’s standing there shoulder-to-shoulder with Barr. Now, are we to believe he’s compromised, as well? They’re trying to discredit him.”

Under Schiff’s chairmanship, added Crawford, the House Intelligence Committee operates as a partisan tool of the Democrat Party.

“The Intelligence Committee is supposed to be about protecting the country, and what Adam Schiff has turned it into, it’s an arm of the DCCC. It is a propaganda organ of the Democrat Party and what can we do to smear the president sufficiently to deny him a second term.”

All Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee, including Crawford, requested Schiff’s resignation on Thursday given Schiff’s involvement in advancing the “collusion” narrative.

Crawford said, “We unanimously expressed our discontent with the comments he’s made — that he’s never substantiated — [over] the two years that he has spent making false claims … and accusing the president of X, Y, and Z related to collusion, and there was a laundry list of quotes that I submitted for the record.”

Crawford added, “Basically, the letter is essentially saying, “We’ve lost faith in your ability to lead.’ This is basically a no-confidence letter, and we’re asking him to resign his position. Under his leadership, the Intelligence Committee is weaker and by extension the intelligence community we rely on for national security is weaker because of him. [There] is important stuff that we need to be doing and we have taken our eye off the ball because [Democrats] have been so narrowly focused on the Russia collusion thing that now we can’t get around to … the kind of proper oversight and interaction with our assets overseas, and even here at home with regard to cyber-security and things of that nature [because] we’re spending most of our time in ridiculous hearings trying to perpetuate this Russia narrative.”

Crawford concluded, We need to get back to the core mission of the committee. We’re basically asking him to resign because we think he has demonstrated poor leadership.”

[There] is important stuff that we need to be doing and we have taken our eye off the ball because [Democrats] have been so narrowly focused on the Russia collusion thing that now we can’t get around to … the kind of proper oversight and interaction with our assets overseas, and even here at home with regard to cyber-security and things of that nature [because] we’re spending most of our time in ridiculous hearings trying to perpetuate this Russia narrative.”

Crawford concluded, We need to get back to the core mission of the committee. We’re basically asking him to resign because we think he has demonstrated poor leadership.”

Left-wing pop star Cher proposed that Robert Mueller should “resign” in protest because the full special counsel’s report has not been released yet.

“Robert Mueller Is [American] Hero,” Cher said. “I [Pray] HE RESIGNS IN PROTEST, BECAUSE OF WAY trump’s Holding On 2 His Report, By His Grotesque Teeth‼️”

“trumps,An Odious,Loathsome,Disgusting Repulsive Excuse 4 a Man.He’s a CHEAP CON MAN,WHO’S IN [Love] WITH A N.KOREAN DICTATOR,& [Kisses] THE ASSES OF 3 MORE.”

Robert Mueller Is 🇺🇸Hero.

Of course, Robert Mueller has finished his report as the special counsel for the Department of Justice, so it’s not clear what a resignation would even mean.

Cher, like many in Hollywood, have been taking the Mueller report quite hard, as the report concludes that there was no collusion between Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and Russia. President Trump also will not be charged with obstruction of justice, a decision reached by Attorney General William Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.

In December, the “Just Like Jesse James” singer declared Trump was a “liar, thug, crook, and traitor.”

“He & His Family Are So In Bed With Russia……Putin Puts Mints On Their Pillows,” she said.

Earlier this year, the 72-year-old called the president “Putin’s waterboy.”

“The Most DANGEROUS THREAT To America’s Safety Is The Russian Operative,Who Currently Occupies The White House. There’s a Special Building In The After Life For Putin’s Waterboy…..TRUMP TOWER HELL,” she exclaimed.

In response to President Donald Trump calling Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) “pencil neck,” MSNBC’s Donny Deutsch on “Morning Joe” slammed the president’s appearance, calling him “one of the most repulsive physically human beings” he has ever seen.

“When he started with the ‘pencil neck’ Adam Schiff, it reminds me, and it’s just — sometimes we laugh. And I’ve said this before on the show, he’s just disgusting to look at,” Deutsch said Friday. “He’s obese. I wish we could put out that picture of him from behind, playing tennis or playing golf. He’s one of the [most] repulsive physically looking human I’ve ever seen. And yet — ”

Hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski interrupted Deutsch, chastising him for his remarks.

“OK, OK, Donny. No, no, no,” Scarborough said. “Let’s let him talk that way.”

“This is just not unnecessary,” Brzezinski added during the crosstalk.

Deutsch defended himself, saying, “Joe, but it’s important. That’s what a bully does. He makes fun of people’s physical imperfections. It’s ironic.”

Kim Foxx is under fire after all charges were dropped against the Empire star in connection to allegedly staging a hate crime against himself to boost his career. This week, Foxx’s office backpedaled on claims that the top prosecutor formally rescued herself from the case after Tina Tchen, the former chief of staff of former first lady Michelle Obama, pressured her to have the Smollett investigation transferred from the Chicago Police Department to the FBI.

A partial transcript is as follows:

INGRAHAM: What do you think about this? I mean, Rahm Emanuel, suddenly, has like put the brakes, Oh no, President Trump, go to baseball. Cutie.

YOO: First of all, I think a lot of Americans, myself included, are outraged by this, the fact that this fakes a hate crime. Look, I’m a minority, you’re a woman, what if were to be attacked legitimately, and now we’re going to be less believed by police and prosecutors because of the example of this guy. I think that’s terrible. I think a lot Americans realize something ought to be done. Second, this is why we have a U.S. Justice Department. Okay, so maybe they just spent a lot of time investigating President Trump to no good effect. But, now they actually exist to make sure there is no corruption going on in state government. If you look at the details of this case where Mrs. Obama’s chief of staff calls the prosecutor, Kim Foxx, and all of the sudden these machinations occur and then the case gets dropped. That is exactly what the Justice Department is supposed to be involved in — to make sure there is no corruption in state government. So, I hope that President Trump is right and that the FBI is starting an investigation to look into this.

INGRAHAM: What’s the potential criminal exposure here, both for Foxx and the state’s attorney office itself?

YOO: So, Foxx could be potentially liable for what’s called mail wire fraud of depriving citizens of their honest services, which if she is convicted, right? This is the standard law that is used to go after corrupt state officials. Suppose she got a bribe, suppose she was promised a fundraiser or who knows what kind of other influence to drop this case, the maximum sentence is 20 years in prison.

According to a recent report from Reveal News, Elon Musk’s Tesla left factory injuries off of official reports, to make its factories seem safer for workers than they really are.

Reveal news reports that electric car manufacturer Tesla failed to report a number of injuries at the Fremont, California factory recently. The report notes that Tesla’s security officer brought many of these issues to managers and even CEO Elon Musk, but when discussing the lack of yellow markings designating hazard areas, she was told “Elon does not like the color yellow.”

Reveal News writes:

Concerned about bone-crunching collisions and the lack of clearly marked pedestrian lanes at the Fremont, California, plant, the general assembly line’s then-lead safety professional went to her boss, who she said told her, “Elon does not like the color yellow.” Robots work on Model S cars in Tesla’s factory in Fremont, Calif., in 2015. One color that some of Tesla’s former safety experts wanted to see more of is yellow, the traditional hue of caution used to mark hazards. The melding of cutting-edge technology and world-saving vision is Tesla Inc.’s big draw. Many, including Justine White, the safety lead, went to work there inspired by Elon Musk, a CEO with star power and now a groundbreaking rocket in space.

But what many true Tesla believers found was that the company’s operation was not what they expected it to be:

What she and some of her colleagues found, they said, was a chaotic factory floor where style and speed trumped safety. Musk’s name often was invoked to justify shortcuts and shoot down concerns, they said. Under fire for mounting injuries, Tesla recently touted a sharp drop in its injury rate for 2017, which it says came down to meet the auto industry average of about 6.2 injuries per 100 workers. But things are not always as they seem at Tesla. An investigation by Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting found that Tesla has failed to report some of its serious injuries on legally mandated reports, making the company’s injury numbers look better than they actually are.

Tesla reportedly began marking injuries received at the factory as personal medical issues or claimed they were only minor issues that required first aid, but many injuries were quite serious:

Last April, Tarik Logan suffered debilitating headaches from the fumes of a toxic glue he had to use at the plant. He texted his mom: “I’m n hella pain foreal something ain’t right.” The searing pain became so unbearable he couldn’t work, and it plagued him for weeks. But Logan’s inhalation injury, as it was diagnosed, never made it onto the official injury logs that state and federal law requires companies to keep. Neither did reports from other factory workers of sprains, strains and repetitive stress injuries from piecing together Tesla’s sleek cars. Instead, company officials labeled the injuries personal medical issues or minor incidents requiring only first aid, according to internal company records obtained by Reveal. Undercounting injuries is one symptom of a more fundamental problem at Tesla: The company has put its manufacturing of electric cars above safety concerns, according to five former members of its environment, health and safety team who left the company last year. That, they said, has put workers unnecessarily in harm’s way.

In an email to Tesla director Sam Teller, White said that while she had worked under intense conditions in Kabul, Afghanistan; Fukushima during the radiation crisis; Monrovia during the Ebola crisis; and Ferguson during the riots, she could not sleep at night while working at Tesla due to the safety issues she had seen.

"Hi Sam. I worked at: – Kabul, Afghanistan

– Fukushima during the radiation crisis

– Monrovia during the Ebola crisis

– Ferguson during the riots "I must tell you that I can't sleep here at Tesla" $TSLA Safety Lead for General Assembly, Justine White." pic.twitter.com/HyHpFVrLg0 — Gavran (@ravenvanderrave) March 26, 2019

White told Reveal News: “Everything took a back seat to production. It’s just a matter of time before somebody gets killed.”

At a recent conference, former Facebook security chief Alex Stamos stated that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has “more data about what people want to do online than anyone else in the world.”

CNBC reports that speaking at the Washington Post’s technology and policy conference on Wednesday, former Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos explained how Mark Zuckerberg manages to make decisions and business moves that eventually prove profitable but seem like huge gambles initially. According to Stamos, Zuckerberg can do this as he can almost see into the future because the CEO is “sitting on more data about what people want to do online than anyone else in the world.”

Stamos cited the acquisitions of messaging service WhatsApp for $19 billion and photo-sharing service Instagram for $1 billion as examples of Zuckerberg’s ability to predict the next most popular platforms. Stamos stated that at the time of purchase, these were seen as moves “that people think are insane but turn out to be prophetic because he knows the direction the world is going.”

Stamos is correct that WhatsApp and Instagram have worked very well for Facebook, with Instagram boasting 1 billion active users per month and WhatsApp drawing 1.5 billion users per month. Stamos stated that more Silicon Valley companies need to work together in order to meet shared goals: “People at Morgan Stanley and Goldman (Sachs) hate each other but they understand their boats rise at the same time,” said Stamos. “In the Valley, you have personality driven conflict…and if CEO’s (in tech) snipe at others in keynotes…it’s unlikely for them to work well.”

Stamos added that as issues such as content moderation, regulation of political ads, and cybersecurity become hot topics amongst Washington, Silicon Valley companies will have to work together to deal with them.

It looks like “flopping” has made its way to college basketball again as the Oregon Ducks’ Ehab Amin flopped dramatically to the boards after the Virginia Cavs’ Mamadi Diakite merely gave him a stern look.

Of course, “flopping” has a long history in basketball and occurs when a player purposefully stumbles or falls in an effort to lull refs into thinking he was fouled by an opponent.

Now the Ducks’ Ehab Amin has joined the ranks of the ridiculous after flopping on Thursday night as the Ducks faced the Cavs, the Big Lead reported.

Amin had a bit of a tussle over the ball with the Cavs’ Mamadi Diakite after which Diakite leaned forward and gave Amin a very stern look forehead-to-forehead. In reply, Amin suddenly dropped to the floor as if Diakite had hit him.

Diakite’s face after Amin hit the boards is classic.

As it happens, both players got a technical over the incident. Diakite for initiating forehead to forehead contact and Amin was also given a sanction for the incident.

Ending illegal immigration to the United States is the top priority for Republican voters in terms of increasing the American quality of life, a new survey finds.

In the latest comprehensive survey conducted by Pew Research Center, about 65 percent of GOP voters said the highest priority of the Republican Party should be ending illegal immigration and reducing the illegal alien population currently living in the U.S.

Mass illegal and unchecked immigration to the country has stagnated U.S. wages for decades while redistributing the wealth of America’s working and middle class to higher income earners.

The Pew Research survey reveals Republican voters, by a majority, view illegal immigration as a burden to their quality of life that will impact future generations.

Nationwide, there are roughly 11 to 22 million illegal aliens living in the country. As Department of Homeland Security (DHS) data has revealed, once illegal aliens resettle in the U.S., the overwhelming majority are never deported.

In terms of wage stagnation, research by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has discovered that the country’s mass illegal and legal immigration policy — where more than 1.5 million foreign nationals are admitted every year — shifts about $500 billion in wages away from working and middle class Americans toward new arrivals and economic elites.

Mass immigration, whether legal or illegal, puts downward pressure on Americans’ wages, researchers have repeatedly noted.

Every one percent increase in the immigrant composition of an American workers’ occupation reduces their weekly wages by about 0.5 percent, researcher Steven Camarotta has found. This means the average native-born American worker today has their weekly wages reduced by perhaps 8.5 percent because of current legal immigration levels.

In a state like Florida, where immigrants make up about 25.4 percent of the labor force, American workers have their weekly wages reduced by perhaps more than 12.5 percent. In California, where immigrants make up 34 percent of the labor force, American workers’ weekly wages are reduced by potentially 17 percent.

Likewise, every one percent increase in the immigrant composition of low-skilled U.S. occupations reduces wages by about 0.8 percent. Should 15 percent of low-skilled jobs be held by foreign-born workers, it would reduce the wages of native-born American workers by perhaps 12 percent.

Meanwhile, Trump’s “Hire American” economy has increased blue collar and middle class wages by four percent in the last 12 months, a Goldman Sachs analysis finds. At this rate, Trump could deliver a historic 14 percent wage hike for more than 100 million blue collar and middle class Americans before the 2020 presidential election.

In 2017, the foreign-born population reached a record high of 44.5 million. The U.S. is on track to import about 15 million new foreign-born voters in the next two decades should current legal immigration levels continue. Those 15 million new foreign-born voters include about eight million who will arrive in the country through chain migration, where newly naturalized citizens can bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the country.

The fast-growing migrant rush over the U.S. border is collapsing border security and overwhelming the ability of border agents to process and protect migrants, DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said in a Thursday letter to all members of Congress.

“We face a system-wide meltdown … We are witnessing the real-time dissolution of the immigration system,” the head of the Department of Homeland Security wrote March 28 in a six-page letter. She added that she will soon ask for an emergency funding bill:

I will be working with the Office of Management and Budget to provide you additional details in the near future, but the situation is so dire we want to make notification to you now that we will require additional resources … to ensure immediate safety and care of individuals in our custody.

Her letter emphasized her concern for the aid and welfare of the migrants, and she minimized any mention of Americans’ concerns about the personal and financial costs imposed by the cartels’ trafficking of drugs into U.S. communities and of cheap labor into U.S. workplaces. She also did not mention the opposition by Congress and the business sector to legal reforms that would curb cheap-labor migration, such as the E-Verify system, which exposes employers who try to hire illegals. She wrote:

My greatest concern is for the children [brought by the migrants], who are put at high risk by this emergency and who are arriving sicker than ever before after travelling on the treacherous trek … a resource surge is needed throughout the system to ensure efficient throughput and proper care [of migrants] … including conducting [health and] welfare checks, preparing meals, and accounting for personal property.

Nielsen’s statement did include vague references to the harm caused by the migration to Americans:

We are grappling with a humanitarian and security catastrophe … The result is a dangerous and growing backlog of individuals in custody that has forced us to begin releasing large numbers of aliens … Without additional assistance, we will be forced to increase the releases of the single-adult population from ICE — the only population for which we can currently effectively enforce U.S. immigration laws.

But her letter includes far more appeals to help provide for the welfare and safety of the migrants who have triggered the crisis, including the statement that “our most urgent need is to increase [migrant] throughput to avoid threats to life and property.”

Once the migrants get through the border, they are free to take jobs at wages that are below the level sought by blue-collar Americans. But the migrants’ willingness to work service jobs for cheap is a financial and status boon for employers and upper-income Americans.

NEW – DHS Sec Kirstjen Nielsen is asking for immediate action from Congress to address a “dire situation” at the border including a request for new authority to send unaccompanied minors back to their home countries. “Now we face a system-wide meltdown,” she wrote in a letter. pic.twitter.com/NMocGkaXVS — Katherine Faulders (@KFaulders) March 28, 2019

On Monday, border commissioner Kevin McAleenan provided reporters with some details about the Central Americans’ rush into Americans’ society, jobs, and schools. The March inflow alone will include roughly 15,000 parents and 40,000 children in “family units” who will ask for asylum — and then will be released — plus roughly 35,000 single adults who will try to evade border officers, he said.

McAleenan pinned the blame on Congress and the judges who have jointly cut legal holes in the border fences by allowing migrants to stream into U.S. cities, jobs, and schools if they merely ask for asylum:

The increase in family units is a direct response to the vulnerabilities in our legal frameworks where migrants and smugglers know that they will be released and be allowed to stay in the U.S. indefinitely pending immigration proceedings that could be many years out. This is due to court orders that undermine the integrity of our immigration system. There is no questioning [about] why this is happening.

Current trends suggest that almost one million migrants — including perhaps 400,000 workers — will rationally grab Congress’s tacit invitation to migrate into the United States during 2019.

That migrant inflow augments the normal inflow of roughly 400,000 illegal migrants who sneak across the border, the overstay of several hundred thousand legal visitors and tourists, the arrival of roughly one million legal immigrants, and the arrival of at least one million new white-collar and blue-collar temporary visa-workers. All told, the federal government is expected to allow roughly three million additional legal or illegal foreign workers to flood the U.S. labor market in 2019, just as four million American youths begin looking for the well-paid careers they need to get married, buy houses, and raise families.

On Thursday, Trump displayed anger at Mexico and the Central American governments for not stopping their poor citizens from migrating into Americans’ rich and peaceful society.

Mexico is doing NOTHING to help stop the flow of illegal immigrants to our Country. They are all talk and no action. Likewise, Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador have taken our money for years, and do Nothing. The Dems don’t care, such BAD laws. May close the Southern Border! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 28, 2019

Trump also blamed the Democrats for repeatedly blocking his immigration reforms — yet GOP leaders and many GOP senators also did not try to push those reforms when they held the majority in the House and Senate.

The Trump reforms are strongly opposed by business donors who gain when the government imports more legal and illegal labor, more consumers, and more renters, even though most of the legal and illegal migrants will eventually support Democratic candidates.

We have a National Emergency at our Southern Border. The Dems refuse to do what they know is necessary – amend our immigration laws. Would immediately solve the problem! Mexico, with the strongest immigration laws in the World, refuses to help with illegal immigration & drugs! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 28, 2019

Despite Trump’s campaign promises, Trump’s deputies are not using all their authority to stop the inflow, said Jessica Vaughan, policy director at the Center for Immigration Studies.

For example, Nielsen, McAleenan, and other agency officials say young migrants cannot be repatriated until Congress changes a far-reaching 2008 law, she said. But that “TVPRA” law is narrow and only covers victims of “severe trafficking,” such as prostitutes who are under the lethal control of international criminal gangs, she said.

In contrast, many of the young migrants are not covered by the 2008 law because they are being smuggled willingly — often by coyotes working under contracts with their parents. Under Nielsen, DHS officials are sticking with the far-reaching, pro-migration interpretation set by officials working for former President Barack Obama, she said.

The cross-border flow of children and youths — dubbed “UACs” — is also being protected by a clause in the 2019 budget that makes it difficult for enforcement officials to detect and deport the foreign parents who pay coyotes to deliver their children to the U.S. border agents. The parents pay for the delivery because they know the border agencies will relay the young migrants to temporary shelters run by the Department of Health and Human Services. The parents then pick up their children at the shelters by offering to “sponsor” them until a later court hearing. The UAC-smuggling clause was demanded by Democratic negotiators and approved in February by the GOP negotiators.

The 2019 DHS spending bill provides $1.4 billion for the border wall – and also encourages migrants by promising aid, busses & legal advice/shields, plus favorable future media coverage & Dem cheerleading. Overall, GOP gains on $ and Dems gain on policies https://t.co/rxFzl8Fas0 — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) February 14, 2019

Nielsen’s statement did not blame Democrats but claimed instead Trump’s agencies and the pro-migration Democrats “have common cause.” She wrote:

We all want to enforce the laws of the United States, ensure a safe and orderly migrant flow, protect our communities, reduce the flow of drugs, facilitate legal trade and travel, secure our borders and support vulnerable populations.

In February 2018, Democratic senators united to block Trump’s “Four Pillars” immigration reforms. Their opposition was also joined by more than ten GOP senators.

The Washingon Post reported March 21:

Democrats say they are determined to counter what they view as Trump’s irresponsible fear­mongering over the security risks of the migrants and slow his push for a border wall. Experts have said the barrier would do little to stop the flow of Central Americans who seek to surrender to authorities in hopes of winning asylum protections. In their fight, Democrats have pressed administration officials to acknowledge there is no emergency. During a Senate oversight hearing this month, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) asserted that border crossings “are still at a historic low compared to other times in our nation’s history.”

Blumenthal then suggested that Congress pass a law to raise the inflow of foreign workers by repeating the industry-developed phrase: “fix our broken immigration system.” The Post reported:

“The Trump Administration is cooking the books to justify a vanity project that won’t keep Americans safe. The fact is we’re far closer to the lowest number of border apprehensions we’ve ever seen than the highest,” Blumenthal said in a statement. “I’ve long called for the Administration to step up and work with Congress to fix our broken immigration system and invest in strategic border security — but the Administration’s fraudulent fear-mongering does not work.”

Each year, roughly four million young Americans join the workforce after high school or university. The federal government then imports roughly 1.1 million legal immigrants, refreshes a resident population of roughly 1.5 million white-collar guest workers and roughly 500,000 blue-collar visa workers, and it also tolerates about eight million illegal workers.

In 2019 — because of catch-and-release rules mandated by Congress and the courts — the federal government also will likely release at least 350,000 migrant Central American laborers into the U.S. job market even as at least 500,000 more migrants sneak past U.S. border defenses or overstay their visas.

This federal policy of using legal and illegal migration to boost economic growth for investors shifts enormous wealth from young employees towards older investors by flooding the market with cheap white-collar graduates and blue-collar foreign labor.

This cheap labor economic policy forces Americans to compete even for low wage jobs, it widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids’ schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines millions of marginalized Americans, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.

But Trump’s “Hire American” policy has crimped the supply of new workers, so allowing blue-collar Americans to get a four percent wage increase in 2018.


The fast-growing migrant rush over the U.S. border is collapsing border security and overwhelming the ability of border agents to process and protect migrants, DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said in a Thursday letter to all members of Congress.

“We face a system-wide meltdown … We are witnessing the real-time dissolution of the immigration system,” the head of the Department of Homeland Security wrote March 28 in a six-page letter. She added that she will soon ask for an emergency funding bill:

I will be working with the Office of Management and Budget to provide you additional details in the near future, but the situation is so dire we want to make notification to you now that we will require additional resources … to ensure immediate safety and care of individuals in our custody.

Her letter emphasized her concern for the aid and welfare of the migrants, and she minimized any mention of Americans’ concerns about the personal and financial costs imposed by the cartels’ trafficking of drugs into U.S. communities and of cheap labor into U.S. workplaces. She also did not mention the opposition by Congress and the business sector to legal reforms that would curb cheap-labor migration, such as the E-Verify system, which exposes employers who try to hire illegals. She wrote:

My greatest concern is for the children [brought by the migrants], who are put at high risk by this emergency and who are arriving sicker than ever before after travelling on the treacherous trek … a resource surge is needed throughout the system to ensure efficient throughput and proper care [of migrants] … including conducting [health and] welfare checks, preparing meals, and accounting for personal property.

Nielsen’s statement did include vague references to the harm caused by the migration to Americans:

We are grappling with a humanitarian and security catastrophe … The result is a dangerous and growing backlog of individuals in custody that has forced us to begin releasing large numbers of aliens … Without additional assistance, we will be forced to increase the releases of the single-adult population from ICE — the only population for which we can currently effectively enforce U.S. immigration laws.

But her letter includes far more appeals to help provide for the welfare and safety of the migrants who have triggered the crisis, including the statement that “our most urgent need is to increase [migrant] throughput to avoid threats to life and property.”

Once the migrants get through the border, they are free to take jobs at wages that are below the level sought by blue-collar Americans. But the migrants’ willingness to work service jobs for cheap is a financial and status boon for employers and upper-income Americans.

Border Patrol Agent Hector Garza told Fox News that Congress needs to “get serious and stop rewarding illegal immigration.” His comments follow one of the busiest weeks in Texas immigration history that saw nearly 1,700 migrants illegally cross the border in the Rio Grande Valley Sector in a single day.

“We have lost the ability to know who or what is coming across the border,” Agent Garza told Fox & Friends during an interview on Thursday morning. The agent spoke to Fox News in his capacity as Vice President of the National Border Patrol Council.

“If you live in a poor country like those in Central America and you make your way into the United States knowing that you are going to be released into the United States,” Garza stated, “why wouldn’t these people come? That’s why Congress needs to get serious about this — they need to change the laws so that people are not encouraged to come into the United States (illegally).”

Garza’s comments come during a week where Border Patrol agents in the Rio Grande Valley Sector apprehended nearly 1,700 migrants in a single day, Breitbart News reported. Border Patrol officials said the apprehensions represented the largest single-day total for the sector since 2014.

“We don’t know who or what is coming across because now our agents are having to process these people, transport them, feed them, care for them, and now we can’t even do our job of border security,” the veteran Border Patrol agent stated. “That’s unacceptable.”

Border Patrol officials reported that during the month of February, more than 66,000 migrants were apprehended after illegally crossing the border from Mexico. Officials are now predicting that more than 100,000 will be apprehended in March.

During a speech at the Texas-Mexico border near El Paso, U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin K. McAleenan said, “On Monday, we saw the highest total of apprehensions and encounters in over a decade, with 4,000 migrants either apprehended or encountered at Ports of Entry in a single day. That was Monday.”

“Yesterday, we broke the record again with 4,117,” the commissioner stated. “We are now on pace for over 100 thousand apprehensions and encounters with migrants in March, with 90 percent of those, 90 thousand people, crossing the border illegally between Ports of Entry. March will be the highest month since 2008. The arriving flows are made up primarily of Central American families and unaccompanied children.”

Garza explained the impact of new Border Patrol policies calling for the near-immediate release of most of the migrants that are currently being apprehended. “Out of those 100,000 that are going to be coming in during the month of March, 90 percent are being released into the community.” He said that many of those being released have violent criminal records.

“A lot of these people do commit dangerous crimes,” he explained. “A lot of these people do bring serious diseases into our communities.” He went on to say that agents have been faced with many diseases in the processing centers.

“Congress needs to stop playing politics,” Garza concluded. “They need to make sure that they pass laws and that they provide resources for Border Patrol agents so that we can prevent all of thes mayhem that is happening on the border.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — The number of migrant families and children entering the U.S. from Mexico is so high that Border Patrol is immediately releasing them instead of transferring them to the agency responsible for their release, forcing local governments to help coordinate their housing, meals and travel.

“We need to work toward a clean sweep,” Border Patrol Deputy Chief of Operations Richard Hudson said in a letter obtained by The Associated Press sent to sector chiefs Thursday. “This should be our daily battle rhythm.”

Agents are still doing medical screenings and criminal checks, but the decision means thousands of families will be released without first going through U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement, which manages their deportation cases.

The Del Rio and Rio Grande Valley sectors in Texas and the Yuma, Arizona, sector earlier announced that agents would begin to release families on their own recognizance. A Border Patrol official not authorized to speak on the matter said Wednesday that El Paso and San Diego planned on doing the same. Some sectors were not part of the change, including Tucson, Arizona and El Centro, California.

Families are typically released with notices to appear in immigration court due to legal restrictions on detaining them and lack of holding space. Until now, Customs and Border Protection has detained them briefly before turning them over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, generally within 72 hours, to be released pending the outcome of their immigration cases.

The move came as Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen wrote to Congress asking for emergency funding for humanitarian and operational needs, and the ability to detain families together as long as necessary to deport people faster.

“The volume of ‘vulnerable populations’ is unsustainable. Our system has been able to cope with high numbers in the past, but the composition of today’s flows makes them virtually unmanageable,” she wrote.

Arrests all along the southern border have skyrocketed in recent months. Border agents are on track to make 100,000 arrests and denials of entry at the southern border this month, over half of which are families with children. To manage the crush, U.S. Customs and Border Protection is reassigning 750 border inspectors from their usual duties at the ports of entry to help Border Patrol keep pace with arrivals in between ports of entry. The head of the agency held a press conference in El Paso on Wednesday to say the breaking point had arrived.

But federal lawmakers have fought over whether there is a “crisis” at the border, particularly amid President Donald Trump’s push for a border wall that he claimed will solve all the immigration problems. Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, Chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, said Thursday the evidence shows the immigration system is cracking under the strain.

“The sad reality is that we now have a virtual open border for any migrant who crosses with a minor, and our border security enforcement has been reduced to a mere speed bump for migrants on their path to long-term occupancy in the United States,” he said, adding border officers are being asked to perform an impossible task with no help from Congress.

And along the border, officials were working to manage the families that had been suddenly released. Yuma Mayor Douglas Nicholls said was city is working with various non-governmental organizations to make sure families released by the Border Patrol have temporary housing, food, medical care and help with traveling to their intended destinations.

Most immigrant families coming to the U.S. don’t plan on staying in the border towns they cross through, but rather to meet up with family throughout the country.

“Focusing on the humanitarian effort is the most important focus for the city, Nicholls.

The Yuma Sector has over the last two years seen an extraordinary spike in the number of immigrant families who turn themselves in. Yuma Deputy Chief Patrol Agent Carl E. Landrum said Thursday that agents have arrested 30,000 people in the relatively small sector since October 1.

The facility in Yuma has the capacity to temporarily hold 410 people. Until Thursday, ICE had been picking all of these families up and taking them to Phoenix and Tucson to be processed. But the numbers have swelled so much now that ICE doesn’t have enough resources to pick everybody up, so Border Patrol agents themselves are releasing families in Yuma.

“It is overwhelming us locally, as well as overwhelming the system nationally,” Landrum said.

“The sheer volume of family units crossing the border has overwhelmed ICE’s limited transportation resources; combined with a requirement to detain these individuals for no more than 20 days, the agency has no option but to expeditiously arrange for their release,” ICE spokeswoman Sarah Rodriguez said in a statement.

The agency makes “every attempt to coordinate the release of these individuals with NGOs that provide assistance with basic needs, but the heavy influx in recent months has inundated these organizations as well,” Rodriguez said.

Swanton Sector Border Patrol agents apprehended 10 migrants after they illegally crossed the Canadian border into New York. The apprehensions came in a series of disrupted human smuggling attempts.

Burke Station agents patrolling near Fort Covington, New York, came upon a group of seven men who illegally crossed the border from Canada into the U.S. All of the migrants allegedly admitted to Border Patrol agents that they had no documentation to be legally present in this country, according to information obtained from Swanton Sector Border Patrol officials.

Officials identified five of the migrants as Mexican nationals. One of the other men reported dual citizenship with Algeria and France, while the seventh migrant is a native of Spain.

The U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of New York will be filing charges against four of the men for illegal entry without documentation ( 8 USC 1325). Officials identified two of the others as previously deported illegal aliens. The U.S. Attorney is expected to file felony charges for illegal re-entry after removal (8 USC 1326). The seventh migrant will be processed administratively and turned over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) officers for expedited removal proceedings.

Later that same day, agents assigned to the Swanton Sector Tactical Communications Center notified agents in the field that three people were illegally crossing the border into the U.S. near Chateaugay, New York. Agents responded and quickly apprehended two of the migrants. The third migrant fled to avoid apprehension, officials reported.

The agents carried out a search and eventually apprehended the third migrant.

One of the migrants initially apprehended reported to be a Mexican national while the second is a native of Nicaragua. Agents turned all three men over to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for prosecution on immigration violations.

“It is through teamwork, intelligence and technology that our agents were able to apprehend these illegal aliens and bring them to justice,” Swanton Sector Acting Chief Patrol Agent William Maddocks said in a written statement. “I’m proud of the commitment of our agents as well as the staff at our Tactical Communications Center, and equally appreciative of the partnerships that we have with the U.S. Attorney’s Office, ICE and ERO.”

Swanton Sector Border Patrol agents apprehended 10 migrants after they illegally crossed the Canadian border into New York. The apprehensions came in a series of disrupted human smuggling attempts.

Burke Station agents patrolling near Fort Covington, New York, came upon a group of seven men who illegally crossed the border from Canada into the U.S. All of the migrants allegedly admitted to Border Patrol agents that they had no documentation to be legally present in this country, according to information obtained from Swanton Sector Border Patrol officials.

Officials identified five of the migrants as Mexican nationals. One of the other men reported dual citizenship with Algeria and France, while the seventh migrant is a native of Spain.

A young illegal alien has been sentenced to life in prison for brutally attacking, raping, and beating 17-year-old Nabra Hassanen to death in the sanctuary city of Fairfax County, Virginia.

Darwin Martinez Torres, a 22-year-old illegal alien from El Salvador, was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for murdering Hassanen in June of 2017. Last year, the illegal alien pleaded guilty to raping and murdering the teenage girl.

As Breitbart News reported at the time, Hassanen and a group of fellow Muslim teenagers were eating at a nearby McDonald’s when they left and started walking back to the All Dulles Area Muslim Society (ADAMS) Center. According to police, Torres started following the teenagers.

Soon after the teens noticed Torres, the illegal alien jumped a curb with his car and got out of his vehicle and started chasing the teens while wielding a baseball bat.

Torres was able to grab Hassanen and began beating her with the bat, before ultimately putting her in his car, driving to a neighboring county, raping and murdering her. The illegal alien took her body to a nearby pond and dumped her there for the authorities to later find.

Fairfax County became a sanctuary city last year, whereby local jails and law enforcement are prohibited from turning criminal illegal aliens over to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency for deportation.

For the past two years, the establishment media has buried Torres’ illegal alien status in reports. Associated Press and local media reports on the case, for example, called the illegal alien “Sterling man” in headlines, referring to the illegal alien’s Sterling, Virginia residence.

The Washington Post, similarly, failed to mention Torres’ illegal alien status, only mentioning once that he is from El Salvador.

Illegal immigration is draining red states like Alabama — with a small illegal alien population — of their congressional representation, Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL) says.

During testimony at a House Oversight and Reform Committee this week, Brooks said asking United States residents on the upcoming 2020 Census is necessary to know the number of illegal aliens living in the country and to ensure that congressional districts are drawn based on the number of American citizens, rather than entire populations, including citizens, noncitizens, and illegal aliens.

“I submit the inclusion of the citizenship question on the next census is not only common sense, it is a Constitutionally required,” Brooks said.

After the 2010 Census, illegal aliens were counted for reapportioning Congressional districts and electoral college votes. Hence, states that had fewer illegal aliens saw a shift of their political power to states that had more illegal aliens. [Emphasis added] Law-abiding states lost not only Congressional representation in Congress, they also lost electoral college votes that elect the president of the United States. I submit the citizenship power of citizens in low illegal alien count states was diluted as their Congressional seats and electoral college representation was disproportionately cut. [Emphasis added] Similarly, the counting of illegal aliens for reapportionment of political power purposes violates the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause by unconstitutionally diluting the representative and political power of citizens who live in low illegal alien population states. [Emphasis added]

As Breitbart News has reported, the counting of only American citizens to divide up congressional districts and electoral college votes would shift power away from the affluent, metropolitan coastal cities of the U.S. and towards middle America.

If congressional districts were set by the number of citizens, the overall average population needed per congressional seat could decrease to about 670,000 citizens per district. This would give a stronger advantage for states with small illegal alien populations to gain and keep their current number of congressional seats.

Counting Illegal Aliens in Congressional Districts Will Strip Red States of Representationhttps://t.co/B5yK3bpraU — John Binder 👽 (@JxhnBinder) September 11, 2018

For instance, if by only counting citizens, a state like Ohio, with few illegal aliens, could possibly gain a congressional seat, increasing the state’s total number of representatives to 17. Current projections suggest Ohio will lose a congressional seat.

In West Virginia, which is also slated to lose a congressional seat, the state could keep their three districts if the redistricting is counted by citizens. Indiana, as well, — with less than 180,000 noncitizen residents — would potentially increase its congressional seats from nine to ten if apportionment is based on the number of citizens in the state.

On the other hand, deep blue states with affluent coastal cities are set to make major gains in terms of congressional representation. California has an estimated three million illegal aliens, a total of about 5.3 million noncitizens, and a total population of about 39.5 million residents. Currently, California has 53 congressional seats, the most in the country.

If California’s congressional districts were set by the number of citizens in the state, it would potentially lose three to five congressional seats, leaving the state with about 48 to 50 seats.

“Congressional districts with lower percentages of citizens — because of higher illegal alien concentrations — grant their citizens an unequal representative power when compared to citizens in districts with higher percentages of citizens and lower percentages of illegal aliens,” Brooks said.

The U.S. Supreme Court is set to decide in the coming months the constitutionality of asking American residents their citizenship status on the 2020 Census.

Currently, the U.S. admits more than 1.5 million legal and illegal immigrants every year, with more than 70 percent coming to the country through the process known as “chain migration,” whereby newly naturalized citizens can bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the U.S. In the next 20 years, the current U.S. legal immigration system is on track to import roughly 15 million new foreign born voters. Between seven and eight million of those foreign born voters will arrive in the U.S. through chain migration.

A team of gunmen with the Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion (CJNG) forced three of their victims to kneel for questioning before their executions by firing squad in a crude show of force as they lay claim to yet another Mexican state. The cartel was recently submitted before the U.S. Department of State for classification as a foreign terrorist organization.

In a video recorded by CJNG and then spread through social media, a large team of gunmen can be seen surrounding three men during questioning. Two of the men reveal their names and claim they were kidnappers and extortionists. A third man said he was a street-level drug dealer with changing loyalties.

El poder de fuego del Cartel del @EPN y @osoriochong #CJNG acribilla a unos secuestradores que operaban en la capital del Estado Michoacano. Entre los ejecutados estaba el “Choco-flan” levantado por chapulín vende drogas. @TamaulipasCRojo @VigilantesV @vigilantehuaste pic.twitter.com/8pmIu1WlyC — México Código Rojo (@MexicoCodigoRo) March 29, 2019

The video was apparently recorded in Morelia, Michoacán, the capital of a coastal Mexican state that has seen extensive violence in recent years, despite the claims of Governor Silvano Aureoles Conejo that the region is safe. A top leader with Cartel Los Viagras previously recorded a video where he claimed he took money from Aureoles in exchange for helping win an election.

In the execution video, an unknown speaker claims the CJNG controls Morelia and they will target criminals who do not follow their rules. The video cuts to another scene where the victims are kneeling in front of a cartel firing squad. Moments later, hooded gunmen begin firing hundreds of rounds into the victims–who collapse in a cloud of dust.

The gunmen claim to belong to Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion, a criminal organization linked to a large portion of the violence in Mexico and recently named one of three cartels that two U.S. Congressmen seek to have labeled as foreign terrorist groups.

Editor’s Note: Breitbart News traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila, Nuevo León, and other areas to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities. Breitbart Texas’ Cartel Chronicles are published in both English and in their original Spanish.

McALLEN, Texas – Federal authorities arrested a top operator for Mexico’s Gulf Cartel in Roma, Texas. The Mexican national has a lengthy criminal history in the U.S. and is one of the main leaders of the cartel’s human smuggling network–earning him a spot on the bi-national most wanted list.

This week, U.S. Border Patrol agents arrested 36-year-old Andres “El Pause” Martinez Granados. Court records revealed that authorities charged Martinez Granados with illegal re-entry and took him before U.S. Magistrate Judge Peter Ormsby, who formally notified him of the charge and ordered that he be held without bond. In court, Martinez Granados requested a court-appointed attorney. Martinez Granados also has outstanding state court warrants filed by the Starr County Sheriff’s Office.

The man known as El Pause has prior human smuggling convictions and at least three prior deportations. Law enforcement sources in Mexico identified El Pause as a top Gulf Cartel operator who is considered a major player in the human smuggling operations for the criminal organization.

In June 2018, U.S. federal authorities and the Tamaulipas government launched a bi-national most wanted list called “Se Busca” where they outlined 10 of the top cartel bosses and operators responsible for most crimes along the border. Since the program launched, authorities have arrested seven out of the 10 targets. Granados is the only cartel operator on the list that was arrested in Texas.

Actor and National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) Image Awards host Anthony Anderson said he is happy that the “system worked” for Empire star Jussie Smollett, after prosecutors in Chicago abruptly dropped all charges against him over hoax hate crime against himself.

On Tuesday, the Cook County State Attorney’s Office dropped all charges against the 36-year-old, who was facing 16 separate felony counts related to filing a false report that he was assaulted by two men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs in downtown Chicago in late January.

The decision sparked widespread outrage from across the political spectrum, including from Chicago’s Democratic Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who denounced it as a “whitewash of justice.”

However, many of Smollett’s supporters have used the decision to exonerate him, with Black-ish star Anthony Anderson declaring he now hopes that Smollett will win an award at the upcoming awards ceremony for his performances on Empire.

“I hope to see him here,” Anderson told Variety. “I hope he wins. I’m happy for him that the system worked for him in his favor because the system isn’t always fair, especially for people of color.”

“So I’m glad it worked out for him,” he continued. “It’s not my place or any other person’s place to judge him or what not, but I’m glad [that] he’s nominated…I hope he wins because I’d be interested to hear his speech.”

What’s more? The National Association for the Advancement of Colored Persons (NAACP) initially blamed President Trump for Smollett’s hoax attack.

Elsewhere, Project 21, a national Black Leadership Network of conservatives, has demanded the NAACP to rescind its Image Award nomination for Jussie Smollet.

Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel blamed President Donald Trump in a press conference Thursday for the alleged hate hoax carried out by Empire Jussie Smollett, claiming that the president created a “toxic” and “vicious” cycle for which the star thought he could get away with the purportedly staged attack on himself.

“Look, I’ve always said from day one this is a Trump-free zone, the city of Chicago, and I mean it,” Emanuel told reporters. “Let me be really clear about something: The only reason Jussie Smollett thought he could take advantage of a hoax about a hate crime is for the environment, the toxic environment Donald Trump created.”

“This is a president who drew a moral equivalency between people who are trying to perpetuate bigotry and those who are trying to fight bigotry,” the mayor continued. “As somebody who started his own journey in politics fighting the neo-Nazis in Skokie and Marquette Park, President Trump should literally take his politics, move it aside.”

Prosecutors infuriated Emanuel and the Chicago Police Department this week when they abruptly dropped 16 felony counts that accused Smollett of making a false police report about being the target of the attack.

Investigators believe Smollett, who is black and gay, hired two brothers to stage the January attack in downtown Chicago and that Smollett hoped the attention would help advance his career. Police also allege that before the attack, Smollett sent a letter threatening himself to the Chicago television studio where Empire is shot. Smollett has repeatedly said the two masked men shouted slurs, wrapped a rope around his neck and poured a substance on him. He also told detectives that the attackers yelled that he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan, police said.

The mayor then accused the president of creating a “toxic, vicious cycle” wherein Smollett believed he could pull off the alleged racist and homophobic assault against himself. “The only reason Jussie Smollett thought he could get away with this hoax about a hate crime is because of the environment President Trump created,” Emanuel reaffirmed.

He then criticized the president’s response to the deadly Charlottesville protest in which he said there are “good people on both sides,” and suggested he not involve himself in the Smollett case.

Emanuel concluded his remarks by saying: “My recommendation to the president is good to opening day baseball, sit on the sideline, stay out of this. You created a toxic environment and all of us who are trying to make sure that we share a common set of values that embrace and welcome people of all walks of lives and backgrounds.”

The mayor’s remarks came as city officials ordered Smollett to pay $130,000 to cover the cost of the investigation into his report of a street attack that police say was staged.

A letter from the city’s legal department to Smollett and his attorneys said that figure covers overtime worked by more than two dozen detectives and officers who spent weeks looking into Smollett’s claim, including reviewing video and physical evidence and conducting interviews.

Those resources, the letter said, “could have been used for other investigations.”

Hours earlier, President Trump tweeted that the FBI and the Department of Justice would review the “outrageous” case, calling it an “embarrassment” to the country.

The FBI, which is investigating that letter, has declined to comment.

The Illinois Prosecutors Bar Association (IPBA) has condemned Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx for her handling of the Jussie Smollett case, calling her dismissal of the charges, and public statements, unethical and misleading.

The statement, issued on behalf of the IPBA’s 1,000 members, disputes Foxx’s claims that the case was handled in a typical fashion, and that it was a “deferred prosecution.” The statement reads, in part:

The events of the past few days regarding the Cook County State’s Attorney’s handling of the Jussie Smollett case is not condoned by the IPBA, nor is it representative of the honest ethical work prosecutors provide to the citizens of the State of Illinois on a daily basis. The manner in which this case was dismissed was abnormal and unfamiliar to those who practice law in criminal courthouses across the State. Prosecutors, defense attorneys, and judges alike do not recognize the arrangement Mr. Smollett received. Even more problematic, the State’s Attorney and her representatives have fundamentally misled the public on the law and circumstances surrounding the dismissal. … [T]he State’s Attorney kept the case within her office and thus never actually recused herself as a matter of law. Additionally, the Cook County State’s Attorney’s office falsely informed the public that the uncontested sealing of the criminal court case was “mandatory” under Illinois law. … The State’s Attorney not only declined to fight the sealing of this case in court, but then provided false information to the public regarding it. … Lastly, the State’s Attorney has claimed this arrangement is “available to all defendants” and “not a new or unusual practice.” There has even been an implication it was done in accordance with a statutory diversion program. These statements are plainly misleading and inaccurate.

The statement concludes: “Through the repeated misleading and deceptive statements to the public on Illinois law and circumstances surrounding the Smollett dismissal, the State’s Attorney has failed in her most fundamental ethical obligations to the public. The IPBA condemns these actions.”

This irregular arrangement was an affront to prosecutors across the State, the Chicago Police Department, victims of hate crimes, and the people of the City of Chicago and Cook County. We strongly encourage our members and the public to review the National District Attorneys Associations statement on prosecutorial best practices in high profile cases.

Foxx was elected in 2016 after a super PAC supporting her campaign received $408,000 in contributions from billionaire left-wing mega-donor George Soros, who has funded “progressive” candidates for public prosecutorial offices ever since the eruption of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2014.

The Illinois Prosecutors Bar Association (IPBA) has condemned Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx for her handling of the Jussie Smollett case, calling her dismissal of the charges, and public statements, unethical and misleading.

The statement, issued on behalf of the IPBA’s 1,000 members, disputes Foxx’s claims that the case was handled in a typical fashion, and that it was a “deferred prosecution.” The statement reads, in part:

The events of the past few days regarding the Cook County State’s Attorney’s handling of the Jussie Smollett case is not condoned by the IPBA, nor is it representative of the honest ethical work prosecutors provide to the citizens of the State of Illinois on a daily basis. The manner in which this case was dismissed was abnormal and unfamiliar to those who practice law in criminal courthouses across the State. Prosecutors, defense attorneys, and judges alike do not recognize the arrangement Mr. Smollett received. Even more problematic, the State’s Attorney and her representatives have fundamentally misled the public on the law and circumstances surrounding the dismissal. … [T]he State’s Attorney kept the case within her office and thus never actually recused herself as a matter of law. Additionally, the Cook County State’s Attorney’s office falsely informed the public that the uncontested sealing of the criminal court case was “mandatory” under Illinois law. … The State’s Attorney not only declined to fight the sealing of this case in court, but then provided false information to the public regarding it. … Lastly, the State’s Attorney has claimed this arrangement is “available to all defendants” and “not a new or unusual practice.” There has even been an implication it was done in accordance with a statutory diversion program.

Friday, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra (D) addressed criticisms of his state as being socialist and too highly taxed.

Becerra touted California as “doing a better job than most capitalists” in job creation and went on to praise California’s economy.

“As one state, we are now the fifth largest economy in the world. If we are socialists, we’re doing a better job than most capitalists when it comes to creating jobs. No one creates more jobs than we do,” Becerra argued.

He continued, “We’re number one in agriculture, just as we are in high tech. We’re number one in manufacturing, just as we are number one in clean energy. We graduate more people than anyone else in the country and people keep coming. We’re not 40 million because people hate us, we’re 40 million because we create good jobs. [It’s] not a bad place to live if you can water ski and ice ski on the same day, and so there are some things that make people come to California.”

American consumers regained their mojo in March, pushing the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment up to 98.4 from February’s 93.8.

Economists had expected the final read to match the preliminary reading for March of 97.8.

Consumers were more positive about both their present conditions and their outlook for the future, according to the survey.

The March gain was entirely due to households with incomes in the bottom two-thirds of the income distribution, according to the survey’s chief economist Richard Curtin. Sentiment among households in the top third of incomes fell slightly.

“Middle and lower income households more frequently reported income gains than last month, although income gains were still widespread among upper income households. Indeed, the last time a larger proportion of households reported income gains was in 1966,” Curtin said.

Lower expectations for inflation combined with rising incomes resulted in more favorable gains for real income expectations. All income groups voiced more favorable growth prospects for the overall economy.

Curtin pointed out that too few interviews were conducted following the summary release of the Mueller report to have any impact on the March data.

President Donald Trump’s approval rating jumped five points among likely voters since the report was delivered from Special Counsel Robert Mueller, according to the latest Rasmussen survey.

Trump is now up to a 50 percent approval rating according to Thursday’s results, up five points from his Monday and Friday rating of 45 percent.

This is the highest rating for Trump since he topped 50 percent in the beginning of March. He reached 51 percent approval around Thanksgiving of last year.

Rasmussen tracks daily results via 500 likely voters per night from telephone surveys as well as an online survey tool. The margin of sampling error for the full sample of 1,500 likely voters is +/- 2.5 percentage points.


President Donald Trump berated Democrats Thursday for causing a crisis on the Southern border by promising amnesty for illegal immigrants and making sure they take advantage of legal protections.

“Democrats want to pretend that there is no border crisis, for one simple reason. Because they have caused the border crisis,” Donald Trump said. “You know why else? Honestly? Because they want votes, and they don’t want to give us a win.”

Trump said that illegal immigrants and migrants crossing the border were met by lawyers who coached them to take advantage of the existing legal loopholes to get into the country.

“It’s a big, fat con job, folks,” he said. “It’s a big fat con job.”

The president commented on the ongoing crisis at the border during a rally with supporters in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

Trump recalled the border wall fight he had with Congress, noting that he agreed to call the wall whatever the Democrats wanted. “I said, ‘I will call it whatever the hell you want. Just give me the money to build it,'” he said. “Then they sort of got little cold feet, and now I call it the wall and I got the money anyway.”

He proudly touted his first presidential veto of the Congressional resolution to stop his declaration of a national emergency on the Southern border and thanked House Republicans for blocking Democrat attempts to override the veto. He also promised to travel to the Southern border soon to show off newly constructed physical barriers.

“We are building a wall, we will be finishing the wall, it is moving along rapidly,” Trump said.


Three-time tournament winner Tiger Woods rallied to defeat Patrick Cantlay 4&2 on Friday, advancing to an electrifying Saturday knockout match against Rory McIlroy at the WGC-Match Play Championship.

The showdown of the world’s 64 top-ranked golfers at Austin (Texas) Country Club featured three days of group matches to decide 16 players for weekend knockout matches that will determine a champion.

Woods, seeded 13th, will meet fourth-seeded Rory McIlroy of Northern Ireland in the round of 16 on Saturday morning. They have never met in a match-play test in Ryder Cup singles or WGC Match Play competition.

“I’ll be ready,” Woods said.

Four-time major winner McIlroy beat England’s Matthew Fitzpatrick 4&2 to complete an unbeaten sweep of his group, never trailing in any match.

“I got up early and played some good golf on the front nine,” McIlroy said. “I got scrappy toward the end but I’m through and I’m looking forward to tomorrow.”

“It’s exciting for the tournament. I’m sure it’s going to be exciting for us. I feel good about my game. I’m going to stick with my game plan and not look at him until I have to near the end.”

McIlroy gave a nod to his final-round duel with Woods at last year’s US PGA Tour Championship, where Woods captured his 80th career US PGA victory with a final-round surge while McIlroy struggled.

“I just hope I put up a better fight than I did in Atlanta last year,” McIlroy said.

Former world number one Woods, a 14-time major champion, split his first two matches and needed a victory plus a loss by Brandt Snedeker to reach the weekend from his all-American group.

Aaron Wise led after every hole in routing Snedeker 6&4 and Woods took care of the rest with an impressive fightback, showing the form that made him a superstar 20 years ago and helped him to WGC Match Play titles in 2003, 2004 and 2008.

Woods made bogeys at the par-5 sixth and par-4 eighth to fall 2-down to Cantlay, who gave one back with a bogey at nine.

Woods then reeled off three birdies and an eagle to win the next four holes for a 3-up edge, sinking a 21-foot birdie putt at the par-3 11th and a six-footer at the par-5 12th, then holing out from 82 yards for eagle at the par-4 13th and curling home a 20-foot birdie putt at the par-4 14th.

“Patrick got a bad break at nine. I got a free hole there,” Woods said. “I tried to carry the momentum to the back nine. I made a big putt at 11 and got it rolling from there.”

At 13, he bounced his approach onto the green and saw the crowd erupt as the ball rolled into the cup.

“I was just trying to get it up close and next thing you know it falls in,” Woods said. “I’ll take it.”

Sweden’s Henrik Stenson, seeded 37th, won three of the first four holes and never trailed in completing an unbeaten run through his group with a 5&4 win over previously unbeaten US 52nd seed Jim Furyk.

Australian Researchers have produced a study that has led them to believe the word “cyclists” should be banned, because it “dehumanizes” people who ride bikes.

Researchers at Queensland University of Technology and Monash University claim to have found a link between the word “cyclists” and a tendency for motorists to “dehumanize” bikers, according to the Daily Mail.

Queensland University Professor Narelle Haworth claimed the study found 55 percent of non-cyclists surveyed in Victoria, NSW, and Queensland felt that cyclists were “not completely human.”

With those results in hand, Haworth is advocating for an end to the use of the word “cyclists.”

Haworth, who is also Director of the Centre for Accident Research and Road Safety in Queensland, insisted that the elimination of the word would help bike rider safety.

“If we used the term people on bikes, instead of cyclists, we’re giving a term that is more human-like and less like a species,” Haworth told Daily Mail.

“We need to spread the idea that those people [cyclists] could be any of us. There is need to grow a culture of mutual respect for people on bikes,” Hayworth added.

The study also reportedly found that one in ten drivers would purposefully block bike riders and admitted to cutting off bikers in the past. Others admitted to yelling at bikers and even throwing things at them.

The professor insisted that eliminating the word would take some of the sting out of the negativity between bike riders and motorists.

BOSTON (AP) — A procession of wealthy parents, from a Napa Valley vineyard owner to a Hot Pockets heiress, are appearing in court Friday to hear charges that they paid bribes to get their children into top colleges.

The 15 parents, including CEOs, investment executives, real estate developers and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, are slated to appear in Boston federal court on charges related to the nationwide college admissions cheating scheme dubbed Operation Varsity Blues.

Former casino executive Gamal Abdelaziz was the first to appear before Magistrate Judge Page Kelley.

Abdelaziz, the former president of Wynn Macau, who has also held leadership roles at Caesars Entertainment and MGM Resorts, didn’t make a statement in court, like most defendants. But his lawyer told the judge his client intends to fight the charges.

“This is not a strong case,” Brian Kelly said as he requested permission for Abdelaziz to travel to Mexico on business next month.

“This is a one-witness case” that relies on a “deeply compromised” witness, he said. “This is winnable.” Kelley granted the request on the condition Abdelaziz turn in his passport after the trip.

Abdelaziz is among 33 prominent parents charged in what authorities have called the biggest college admissions scam ever prosecuted . Authorities say the parents paid an admission consultant to rig their children’s test scores and bribe coaches at sought-after schools.

The most familiar names of the accused parents are actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin, but they’re not scheduled to appear in court until next week.

Among the others appearing Friday is 48-year-old Michelle Janavs, a former executive at her family’s food manufacturing company, Chef America, which made Hot Pockets before being bought out by Nestle for $2.6 billion in 2002.

She is accused of paying at least $100,000 to help her two daughters cheat on their college admissions exam and get into the University of Southern California as beach volleyball recruits.

William McGlashan, a 58-year-old former executive for the private equity firm TPG, is accused of paying bribes to get his son into USC as a recruit for the college’s storied football team, even though his son didn’t play football and his high school didn’t field a team.

And 53-year-old Austine Huneeus, whose family owns vineyards in California’s Napa Valley and in Oregon, is accused of paying at least $50,000 to have SAT administrators correct his daughter’s college entrance exam and to have USC officials designate her as a water polo recruit to improve her chances of getting into the college.

The initial court appearances are largely a formality.

Defendants weren’t asked to enter a plea Friday. Court officials simply recited the charges and maximum sentences while the judge informed the defendants of their rights and considered any special requests, such as Abdelaziz’s travel request.

The other defendants appearing Friday include prominent Miami developer Robert Zangrillo; Gregory Abbott, the founder and chairman of International Dispensing Corp. and his wife, Marcia Abbott; and Marci Palatella, who founded bourbon maker Preservation Distillery in Kentucky.

On Thursday, former Yale University women’s soccer coach Rudy Meredith became the third person to plead guilty in the case. Rick Singer, the admissions consultant at the center of the scheme, has also pleaded guilty.


The winner at this week’s WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play tournament is yet to be determined. However, the early prize for the most clutch, odds-defying shots clearly goes to Tiger Woods.

Fresh off an amazing left-handed shot on a ball that was under a bush during Thursday’s action, Tiger continued the theatrics on Friday afternoon by sinking an 82-yard wedge shot on the par-4 13th for an eagle 2.

Watch:

The shot put Woods up two on Patrick Cantlay.

According to Sports Illustrated, “Woods, who is making his final start before the Masters. entered the day needing to beat Cantlay and have Aaron Wise beat Brandt Snedeker to advance to the knockout round portion of this tournament. He appears on his way to holding up his end of the bargain.”

He does indeed.

When you caddie for Tiger Woods, your visibility is higher than what it might be for most other golfers. It also means, apparently, that you have to lay down the law.

Such an instance was caught on video Friday, as Tiger Woods’ caddie Joe LaCava angrily snatched a hat off a patron while Woods was taking a swing.

Watch:

Some on Twitter have speculated that LaCava’s reaction was due to the patron merely taking pictures during the shot. However, the fan is only one of at least a dozen people taking pictures. Instead, it’s more likely that the man did not mute the camera on his phone.

The fan raises his hand and immediately acknowledged his error.

So, let it be known to all: do not talk, take unmuted pictures, or do anything to draw attention to yourself while Tiger Woods is taking a swing. Otherwise, you’ll have to deal with Joe.

What do Bryce Harper and Santa Claus have in common? Both have been booed by Philadelphia fans.

It happened after Harper’s second at-bat. With a runner on third and nobody out, Philly’s $330 million man struck out. Eliciting the response that Philadelphia athletes have become accustomed to when they disappoint the hometown faithful.

Watch:

That reaction was predicted by fellow former National and Phillie, Jayson Werth.

“It could be his first game,” Werth said when asked when Harper might first get booed.

After reporters seemed surprised by that response, Werth doubled-down: “Oh, you think that’s out of the realm of possibility? It’s not going to take long. I can promise you that.”

A similar fate greeted the Yankees Giancarlo Stanton last year when he he struck out five times after signing a $325 million contract. It turns out fans develop unrealistic expectations when their teams sign players to 9-figure contracts.

Who knew?

President Donald Trump said Thursday he would fund the Special Olympics after an outcry over a budget proposal.

“The Special Olympics will be funded. I just told my people, I want to fund the Special Olympics, and I just authorized funding of the Special Olympics,” Trump said. “I’ve been to the Special Olympics, I think it’s incredible, and I just authorized funding. I heard about it this morning. I have overridden my people. We’re funding the Special Olympics.”

The president spoke about the issue to reporters at the White House on Thursday as he left for a campaign rally in Michigan.

The 2020 budget proposal from Department of Education Secretary Betsy Davos cut $17.6 million from the Special Olympics, citing a plethora of support for the organization from private philanthropy.

Democrats immediately weaponized the news, blasting the Trump administration for the proposal, although it was extremely unlikely that Congress would support the cuts.

Chairman of Special Olympics International Dr. Timothy P. Shriver tried to clarify in a statement that the government does not directly support the Special Olympics, but coordinates with the organization for special education services in school:

Even 2020 presidential candidate Bernie Sanders appeared apoplectic about the proposal.

“Unbelievable,” Sanders wrote on Twitter. “When we are in the White House we will get our national priorities straight.”


New England Patriots Owner Robert Kraft will be treated just like a player if he violated the NFL’s personal conduct policy, according to Commissioner Roger Goodell.

The 77-year-old widower was recently charged with two counts of soliciting sex in a Florida prostitution investigation. He was reportedly caught on surveillance video engaging in sex acts during two visits to Orchid’s Day Spa in Jupiter. The case is still being adjudicated.

“The personal conduct policy applies to everybody – commissioners, owners, executives, players, coaches, and it will be applied to everybody,” said Goodell. “But it will be done after we get all the facts, we have all the information, and we’ll be fair and smart about it. And that’s what we’ll do.”

The NFL is generally very protective of its image, and doesn’t take kindly to those who work in the league tarnishing it.

“It is a privilege to be part of the National Football League,” the personal conduct policy states. “Everyone who is part of the league must refrain from ‘conduct detrimental to the integrity of and public confidence in’ the NFL,” the Personal Conduct Policy states. “This includes owners, coaches, players, other team employees, game officials, and employees of the league office, NFL Films, NFL Network, or any other NFL business.”

The policy goes on to say, “Conduct by anyone in the league that is illegal, violent, dangerous, or irresponsible puts innocent victims at risk, damages the reputation of others in the game, and undercuts public respect and support for the NFL.”

If the long-time Patriots owner is found guilty, he could be fined and/or suspended by the commissioner, just like players who run afoul of the law.

In fact, Goodell could actually be more heavy-handed with Kraft, if guilty, since the policy states: “Ownership and club or league management have traditionally been held to a higher standard and will be subject to more significant discipline when violations of the Personal Conduct Policy occur.”

One example of Goodell punishing an owner severely came in 2014, when Indianapolis Colts boss Jimmy Irsay plead guilty to drunk driving and was suspended for six games and fined $500,000.

Kraft issued a statement apologizing on March 23:

“I am truly sorry,” Kraft said. “I know I have hurt and disappointed my family, my close friends, my co-workers, our fans and many others who rightfully hold me to a higher standard.”

However, even though he apologized, on March 26, Kraft plead not guilty to the solicitation charges, and asked for a jury trial. He waived his right to an arraignment and is scheduled to make a court appearance on April 9 in West Palm Beach.

But if the Florida judge rules against him. he will not only be sentenced in West Palm Beach, but at 345 Park Avenue at the NFL’s world headquarters.

“The personal conduct policy is my responsibility,” Goodell said.


NBA great Charles Barkley warned that there could be “repercussions” from Empire actor Jussie Smollett’s actions, and said “we all lose” from what happened in Chicago.

The Turner Sports basketball analyst told CBS’ Stephen Colbert that Smollett may think he has gotten off scot free, but the whole incident will still have costs, Fox News reported.

Barkley’s comments came only hours after Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx inexplicably dropped all 16 felony counts against Smollett and even noted that his records should be sealed, and his name cleared despite the grand jury findings and a months-long investigation into what the Chicago Police determined was a hoax hate crime.

“I think that we all lose,” Barkley continued. “I think my black friends, my gay black friends, I think they lose, because there’s all repercussions when you’re a minority. There’s always a double standard. You have to understand that and accept that. For every black, gay person out there, we lost — and it’s unfortunate.

“I don’t know that kid (Smollett), I wish him nothing but the best,” Barkley told Colbert. “But you have to understand, you have to always look at the big picture. Like, you know, there’s a lot of gay kids out there who are struggling. They’re getting beat up, they’re getting bullied, and things like that, and that’s not good.

“Then you see there’s this tenuous relationship between the black community and the cops, and we made the cops look really bad in this scenario, and there’s probably going to be some resentment,” Barkley concluded. “So, the bottom line is everybody lost in this scenario. It’s not good.”

Barkley treated the Smollett situation less seriously after news broke that the Chicago Police found that Smollett may have used a personal check to pay for the hate crime hoax.

Barkley had his co-workers rolling as he slammed Smollett during TNT’s half-time coverage of the Houston Rockets-Los Angeles Lakers game in February.

The former 76ers star began by joking, “Two black guys beating a black guy up… Just thinking out loud.

“America, let me just tell you something,” Barkley said addressing the camera. “Do not commit crimes with checks,” he quipped as his fellow commentators chuckled.

“Come on, man. If you’re gonna break the law, do not write a check. … Get cash, man!” Barkley said snickering.

During the WGC Match Play Championship, Tiger got on the ground and hit a ball that was under a bush — left-handed — from his knees.

Watch:

The shot halved a hole against Brandt Snedeker.

As the Big Lead noted:

We’ve seen Tiger chip in from behind the 16th green at Augusta and we’ve seen him chip in with a flop shot toward the water at The Memorial. While this shot didn’t come with the same pressure, it’s even more impressive, because, well, when the hell has he ever practiced this shot? The other ones, yeah, he practiced them in some way, shape or form. This one? No one can prepare for this. But Tiger can execute it.


Philadelphia Phillies outfielder Bryce Harper has the most popular jersey in Major League Baseball, according to online sales details revealed Thursday by the league.

Harper signed a 13-year, $330 million contract with the Phillies on March 2 after spending his first seven seasons with the Washington Nationals.

His number three shirt with the Phillies set North American professional sports records for most jerseys sold in the first 24 and 48 hours after joining a new team, according to Fanatics online shops.

Harper was followed by fellow All-Star outfielder Aaron Judge of the New York Yankees, whose jersey sales had led the major leagues in each of the past two seasons.

Mookie Betts, reigning American League Most Valuable Player for the World Series champion Boston Red Sox, ranks third with seven-time All-Star Mike Trout of the Los Angeles Angels and nine-time All-Star catcher Yadier Molina of the St. Louis Cardinals rounding out the top five.

Reporter Jenny Sushe has hired attorney Gloria Allred after Bulgarian boxer Kubrat Pulev delivered an unsolicited kiss during an interview.

Sushe was interviewing the Bulgarian heavyweight, but when she began to wrap up her few minutes with him, Pulev suddenly grabbed the reporter by the face and planted a kiss on her lips before walking away.

Bruh wtf is this interview man lmao! Pulev is alpha af. (Watch until end) pic.twitter.com/sUoiqFprhi — NBT BOXING (@BoxingNbt) March 24, 2019

Pulev later blew off the controversy saying that he is friendly with Sushe and the quick kiss was no big deal, according to TMZ.

“On the video, after our kiss, we both laughed about it and thanked each other,” Pulev said. “There really is nothing more to this.”

It is true that the two laughed after the kiss but before the video cuts, Sushe appeared non plussed by the encounter and is heard saying “Jesus Christ.”

Now, it appears that her discomfort with the kiss has grown enough that she is seeking council.

ESPN commentator Keith Olbermann is now apologizing for unleashing thousands of his social media followers in an attack on a Mississippi hunter who bagged a rare turkey with all-white plumage.

The ESPN sportscaster took to his Twitter account to apologize “unreservedly” for a previous tweet attacking Hunter Waltman, of Kiln, Mississippi, after the Mississippi Clarion Ledger reported his rare harvest.

“I am an opponent of trophy hunting and remain so, but nobody should feel threatened. This was anything but my intent, so I unreservedly apologize to Mr. Waltman for this tweet,” Olbermann tweeted on Wednesday evening.

The one-time MSNBC bomb-thrower also deleted his earlier tweet attacking Mr. Waltman where he called the man a series of vicious names.

After the Ledger published its news story about Waltman’s hunt, Olbermann tweeted a full-frontal attack on the man.

“It be rare and beautiful so me should kill it,” Olbermann tweeted, adding, “This pea-brained scumbag identifies himself as Hunter Waltman, and we should do our best to make sure the rest of his life is a living hell. And the nitwit clown who wrote this fawning piece should be fired.”

The editor in chief of the Ledger quickly came to the defense of his paper and reporter and slammed Olbermann for goading thousands of his social media followers to go on the attack against the hunter.

“What was I thinking?” Ledger editor in chief Sam Hall said on his own Twitter feed in reply to Olbermann’s accusations. “I guess I should have fired our outdoors writer for writing about a hunter killing an unusual turkey during turkey hunting season.”

Olbermann’s apology may have been sparked by his place of employment. According to Fox News, ESPN said “We have spoken to him about not making personal attacks.” After that, Olbermann issued his apology.

ESPN commentator Keith Olbermann has called for making a young man’s life a “living hell,” goading his social media followers to attack him for shooting a rare white turkey during hunting season.

The Mississippi Clarion Ledger recently reported that Hunter Waltman, of Kiln, Mississippi, legally bagged a rare all white turkey.

The turkey Waltman bagged had nearly all white plumage, with white spurs and nails, but a black beard and normal eyes — meaning the bird isn’t an albino. The bird was apparently “one out of several hundred thousand individuals.”

But the SportsCenter host was not interested in celebrating Waltman’s rare trophy. Indeed, the TV sportscaster’s tweet organized his social media followers to launch an all-out assault against the man.

Olbermann soon jumped to his Twitter account to mock Waltman for the hunt saying, “It be rare and beautiful so me should kill it.”

The ESPN host added that Waltman was a “pea-brained scumbag.” But he also criticized the Ledger for daring to write a story about the rare harvest.

It be rare and beautiful so me should kill it. This pea-brained scumbag identifies himself as Hunter Waltman and we should do our best to make sure the rest of his life is a living hell. And the nitwit clown who wrote this fawning piece should be fired. https://t.co/KdU3Bkg104 — Keith Olbermann (@KeithOlbermann) March 26, 2019

For its part, the paper stood by both its reporter and his story.

“What was I thinking?” Ledger editor in chief Sam Hall said on his own Twitter feed. “I guess I should have fired our outdoors writer for writing about a hunter killing an unusual turkey during turkey hunting season.”

.@KeithOlbermann says @BrianBroom should be fired for writing this story. What was I thinking? I guess I should have fired our outdoors writer for writing about a hunter killing an unusual turkey during turkey hunting season. https://t.co/3lhrtlwlQO — Sam R. Hall (@samrhall) March 26, 2019

It was not long before thousands of Olbermann’s rabid, left-wing social media followers began to harass both the hunter and the Clarion-Ledger for the turkey story.

Soon, Hall was back on Twitter to slam Olbermann for being “recklessly irresponsible” for sending his one million followers on the attack over the hunting story.

“Keith Olbermann‘s tweet was recklessly irresponsible,” Hall wrote. “Someone with his following needs to understand the possible impact of his words. Telling over 1 million people to make someone’s life a living hell could have seriously dangerous consequences.”

In yet another Tweet, Hall noted that refusing to write the hunting story would have been grounds for firing. “In our newsroom, that would be a fireable offense, not writing a story about a hunter bagging a turkey,” he said.

Amusingly, the Washington Free Beacon found that Olbermann was once a pitchman for fast food chain Boston Market and was part of a campaign to sell the restaurant’s turkey sandwiches.

After 21 years it can be revealed… We actually shot FIVE Boston Market “EAT SOMETHING” commercials. Two made air. One was never edited. But two…survived. Here, for the first time, is…

Grace Brethren Christian School, a pre-kindergarten through 12th grade school in Maryland, has withdrawn from their athletic conference due to a transgender policy that allows biological males to compete against girls.

The school had planned to leave the Potomac Valley Athletic Conference in the spring, due to the long distances their athletes would have to travel to play other teams in the conference. However, the school expedited their exit plan after the conference began allowing males identifying as girls to compete against biological females without a two-thirds vote by the league.

George Hornickel, school director for Grace Brethren, told the Washington Post that the “transgender issue,” and the challenges that issue poses to the school’s values, are a the core of their decision to leave the conference.

“We are a Christian school and hold to the biblical teaching from Genesis 1:27 and other related passages which states, ‘So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created them, male and female He created them,’” Hornickel wrote in a email to the Post. “This is how it has been throughout the history of the world, and we believe there are only two sexes: male and female.”

Hornickel continued, saying that the practice of allowing biological males to compete against biological females, is a “form of cheating.” Hornickel feels it “gives them an advantage over girls teams who only play female athletes.”

PVAC President Taisto Saloma, doubled-down on the conference’s policy. Claiming that the league is committed to “honoring everyone’s identity.”

“It’s something we’ve, in this year in particular, spent a lot of time talking about: How can we make sure we are doing that in a space that is changing and evolving, as it is becoming more apparent to all of us as educators and people who work in schools?”

According to the Christian Post:

GBCS’ departure from the PVAC comes at a time in which concerns have been raised about how the push to embrace transgender-inclusive policies in school athletics could infringe on the opportunities granted to girls and women. In his communication with The Washington Post, Hornickel said that allowing biological males to compete with females ‘undermines’ Title IX, which was meant to create more opportunities for women. ‘When guys identifying as transgendered girls begin making up the rosters of female teams, girls who otherwise could have started are now coming off the bench, and girls who were the reserves may not make the teams,’ Hornickel explained.

Elite female competitors have also begun sounding the alarm over transgender inclusion in female sports. Tennis great Martina Navratilova received tremendous backlash saying that allowing males to compete against women was, “insane and cheating.” In addition, British Olympic swimmer Sharron Davies, has called for banning transgender athletic competition.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — The National Park Service improperly banned an Alaska moose hunter from using a hovercraft on a river through a national preserve, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Tuesday in a unanimous decision.

The court limited the National Park Service’s authority to enforce laws and regulations on state-owned rivers in Alaska. Justices rejected the agency’s argument that the river was “public land” for regulatory authority and that the agency’s water rights interest gave it rule-making authority.

The outcome was a victory for moose hunter John Sturgeon of Anchorage, who had sued and lost in lower court rulings.

“We reverse the decision below and wish Sturgeon good hunting,” Justice Elena Kagan said in reading a summary of the decision.

Sturgeon called it “a huge win for Alaska.”

“What it basically said is that the federal government doesn’t get the manage in-holdings including navigable waters in any of the conservation units in Alaska, and that’s huge,” he told The Associated Press.

Justices cited the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act that in 1980 set aside 162,500 square miles (420,875 square kilometers) of land for preservation purposes. The law created 10 new national parks, preserves and monuments but said agency rules would not apply on state or private land within the conservation units that are not federally owned.

Sturgeon for 40 years hunted moose along the Nation River, a waterway within the Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve in northeast Alaska. In 2007, he was using a hovercraft, a loud, blower-powered amphibious vehicle that can navigate in shallow water or even mud.

The agency had banned hovercraft in other states. Three Park Service rangers told Sturgeon it was illegal to operate his hovercraft and he headed home.

Sturgeon sued in 2011. After lower courts rejected his arguments, the Supreme Court in 2016 said the 1980 law had carved out numerous Alaska-specific exceptions to the Park Service’s general authority over federally managed preserves, such as snowmobile and airplane travel between villages.

Justices sent the case back for reconsideration but the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals concluded the agency had regulatory authority over a river in a preserve. The Supreme Court justices rejected that conclusion.

The 1980 law creating new parks and reserves surrounded more than 28,125 square miles (72,844 square kilometers) of state, Alaska Native and private land, Kagan wrote. The National Park Service, the court said, has broad authority to administer lands and waterways within parks across the country. However, Congress in the Alaska law added a provision that only “public” land — the federally owned land and waters — would be subject to the federal regulations, Kagan wrote.

The federal government’s reserved water right in the Nation River, she said, allows the National Park Service to protect it from depletion or diversion but not to target hovercraft.

“I was very happy that they kind of really understood Alaska. They recognized that the rivers in Alaska are very often our highways, like (Interstate) 5 that goes through California and Oregon and Washington, and the Yukon is kind of our equivalent of I-5,” Sturgeon said.

“Sturgeon can again rev up his hovercraft in search of moose,” Kagan wrote.

“I thought that was pretty cool,” Sturgeon said of Kagan’s humorous touches, adding they made the decision feel “real human.”


March 27 (UPI) — First-year Arizona Cardinals coach Kliff Kingsbury will allow players to have cellphone breaks every 20 or 30 minutes during team meetings.

Kingsbury, 39, spoke about the policy Tuesday at the NFL annual meeting in Phoenix. He was hired in January after the franchise fired Steve Wilks after one season.

“You start to see kind of hands twitching and legs shaking, and you know they need to get that social media fix, so we’ll let them hop over there and then get back in the meeting and refocus,” Kingsbury told reporters.

Kingsbury said he is implementing the practice in order to maximize the time he has with the players. He had a similar policy while coaching at Texas Tech, the school that fired Kingsbury in November.

The Cardinals finished with a 3-13 record in 2018 and own the No. 1 overall pick in the 2019 NFL Draft.


Actor Chris Evans is once again voicing his dismay with New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, over the NFL star’s support of President Donald Trump. Even to the point where he’s undecided about whether he would portray Brady in a movie.

Evans has criticized Brady before, and this latest slight against the NFL player comes in a wide-ranging interview with the Hollywood Reporter.

The Avengers: Endgame actor told the paper that he understands that actors may not want to “alienate half your audience,” but he had to admit that he just doesn’t care what people he disagrees with think about politics.

That point brought the paper to ask the Captain America star about his constant needling of the Super Bowl-winning Brady for his support of Trump.

“His willingness to call bullshit on anyone abetting the disintegration of our republic extends to his home state’s favorite sons,” Hollywood Reporter gushed. The paper then asked if Evans would agree to play Brady in a movie. According to the Reporter, Evans “looked grim” at the very thought.

“I don’t know,” Evans said. “I really hope he’s not a Trump supporter. I’m just hoping he’s one of those guys that maybe supported him and now regrets it. Maybe he thought it was going to be different — and even that bothers me — but maybe there’s a chance now he just thinks Trump’s an absolute dumb shit, which he is. If he doesn’t, if he’s still on that Trump train, I might have to cut ties. It’s really tough.”

But Evans added, maybe Brady has reconsidered and just won’t let on.

“I think maybe a couple of years ago,” he added, “I might have tried to pull some, like, mental gymnastics to compartmentalize, but I don’t know if I can anymore. So I’m just hoping he’s woken up.”

This is not the first time Evans has gone after Brady for his perceived politics. In April of last year, for instance, Evans allowed that he was going to give Brady “a pass” for his support of Trump.

“Well, I tell you what, if anyone gets a pass it’s Tom Brady,” Evans told USA Today.

The House Oversight and Reform Committee has requested financial documents on President Donald Trump’s bid to purchase the Buffalo Bills in 2014, a pair of top House Republican lawmakers said Wednesday.

According to Reps. Mark Meadows (R-NC) and Jim Jordan (R-OH), the request is part of a larger probe into the president’s previous business dealings in which Democrats are seeking 10 years worth of financial records from the accounting firm Mazars USA. The Republicans say former Trump attorney Michael Cohen’s recent testimony, during which he alleged the president exaggerated his personal net worth in an effort to acquire the NFL team, likely triggered the fresh inquiry.

Politico reports:

Jordan and Meadows, two of the president’s closest allies on Capitol Hill, made the revelations in a letter to Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) in which they alleged that the request for such information about Trump “appears to depart from responsible and legitimate oversight,” and is intended “solely to embarrass President Trump and to advance the relentless Democrat attacks upon the Trump administration.” […] The lawmakers sent a separate letter to Victor Wahba, the chairman and chief executive officer of Mazars USA, stating that Cummings did not consult with the GOP side of the committee before request the documents on Trump’s finances.

“We should not waste our limited resources and energies on matters that do not improve the operations of the federal government or better the lives of our constituents,” Meadows and Jordan wrote, describing Cummings’ inquiry “an ill-conceived inquiry into the finances of President Trump when he was a private citizen.”

In a statement to Politico, Cummings said of Meadows and Jordan’s letter: “They complain about everything I do,” before adding, “We’re just seeking the truth.”

Meanwhile, earlier this month, the House Judiciary Committee sent letters seeking documents from more than 80 groups, organizations, and individuals as part of the panel’s investigation into President Trump’s past commercial activities and campaign.

Thus far, past and current members of the president’s inner circle have complied with the sweeping request. Steve Bannon, the president’s former White House chief political strategist and former Breitbart News chairman, handed over 2,688 pages of information, while real estate tycoon and Trump’s inaugural committee chairman Thomas Barrack has provided more than 3,349 pages.

The new Democrat-led inquiry follows the release of Attorney General William Barr’s summary of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on his two-year investigation into alleged Trump-Russia collusion. According to Barr’s four-page summary of Mueller’s findings, the special counsel concluded the Trump campaign and Russia did not collude with one another despite repeated attempts by the latter.


March 26 (UPI) — NFL owners approved a new rule that will allow replay reviews on pass interference calls, as well as non-calls.

Dallas Cowboys CEO Stephen Jones told the NFL Networkthat coaches can now challenge pass interference calls or non-calls outside of the two-minute warning in each half. The booth will automatically review any controversial interference penalty or non-call inside of two minutes.

Both offensive and defensive pass interference calls are now challengeable, according to ESPN. The new rule will go into effect for at least the 2019 season.

The vote for the replay review changes among NFL owners was 31-1, with the Cincinnati Bengals being the only team to vote against the rule, according to the NFL Network.

“People compromised on long-held views because people wanted to get it right,” NFL commissioner Roger Goodell told reporters.

Last season’s NFC Championship Game between the New Orleans Saints and Los Angeles Rams ended with a controversial missed pass interference call. Rams cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman appeared to hit Saints receiver Tommylee Lewis before the ball arrived, but a flag wasn’t thrown on the play. The Saints settled for a field goal and eventually lost in overtime.

“This is what I wanted to happen. That’s why I made my statement,” Saints owner Gayle Benson told reporters. “[The non-call in the title game] will never happen again.”

The new rule change would allow on-field officials to change a critical pass interference ruling. There were 249 pass interference calls last season, according to NFLPenalties.com.


A segment of the Wendy Williams Show featuring former ESPN host Jemele Hill, was cut short after the topic turned to President Trump. Fox 5 attributed the interruption to, “technical difficulties.”

During Tuesday’s broadcast of Williams’ daytime talk show, Williams began asking the former ESPN host about her comments in 2017 that Trump is a “white supremacist.” But before Hill could answer, the video was cut, and a commercial for pizza chain Papa John’s started airing. By the time Atlanta’s Fox affiliate returned to the show, the anti-Trump questions were over, according to the New York Daily News.

Fox 5 issued a statement saying that the segment was dumped because of technical difficulties at the station.

“This morning, during a live broadcast of The Wendy Williams Show, FOX 5 experienced technical difficulties which triggered an interruption of the program. The issue has been addressed and resolved. The program will be rebroadcast tomorrow morning from 3am-4am,” Fox 5 said in a statement.

Several weeks after calling the president a white supremacist in 2017, Hill was suspended from ESPN for breaking the network’s rules about engaging in political advocacy. Eventually the sports network bought out her contract and removed her from the air. Hill later joined the Atlantic as a “social justice” writer.

Hill has steadfastly stood by her claim that President Trump is a white supremacist.

Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.


Former ESPN host and current Atlantic writer Jemele Hill, recently did an interview with Elle magazine in which she spoke on an issue that she is intimately aware of: the politicization of sports.

Hill, who parted ways with ESPN in September of 2018 after a string of politically-charged tweets targeting President Trump and advising fans on the use of boycotts as a form of protest, grabbed national attention in September of 2017. After she tweeted that Trump was a “white supremacist who has largely surrounded himself with other white supremacists.”

Donald Trump is a white supremacist who has largely surrounded himself w/ other white supremacists. — Jemele Hill (@jemelehill) September 11, 2017

President Trump responded to Hill’s attack with a tweet of his own, saying: “With Jemele Hill at the mike, it is no wonder ESPN ratings have ‘tanked,’ in fact, tanked so badly it is the talk of the industry!”

With Jemele Hill at the mike, it is no wonder ESPN ratings have "tanked," in fact, tanked so badly it is the talk of the industry! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 10, 2017

Yet, when asked by Elle to recall her where she was and how she reacted upon learning that the president had tweeted about her, Hill made it sound like she was almost an innocent bystander to the incident.

I was asleep, and my phone started going off. I don’t follow the president on Twitter, but I think he tweets a lot in the early morning. That day my schedule was such that I didn’t have to work until 12:30 p.m. It was surreal. But I took it in stride. When I got to work, we were making jokes about it. Trump criticizing somebody on Twitter is not new. As big as that moment was in my life and career, there’s no specialness with it. He does it all the time. I was just the latest person.

Of course, Hill was not “just the latest person” to be criticized by Trump on Twitter. She had launched a malicious attack on the president and his entire staff, charging them with racism. Still regarded as the most serious and terrible thing one can be charged with in American public life. Also illustrative is her description of the work environment at ESPN. Why would her colleagues be laughing about one of their most prominent voices getting criticized by the president? As if that’s good for business. And, speaking of business, why would they be laughing about their ratings tanking?

At the time of Trump’s tweet, ESPN was only six months removed from having laid off over 100 employees. Largely due to losing millions of cable subscribers and, as the president correctly pointed out, tanking ratings. In fact, Hill’s own show, SC6, was a major ratings disappointment and would be canceled within five months of Trump’s tweet.

What part of that is funny if you’re an ESPN employee?

Though, things would only get more confusing when Hill was asked what she would say to people who think there’s no room for politics in sports:

People who would prefer that they be separate clearly don’t recognize that sports have always been tied to social issues. Jackie Robinson integrated Major League Baseball in 1947, almost 20 years before the Civil Rights Act passed. The moment you go to an NFL game, it is inherently political. You have the national anthem, flyovers, a military presence. Those are all political symbols. Also, every time they put up a new stadium or arena, who do they come to for the money? Taxpayers. So I think that people who don’t want politics in sports are just being, frankly, intellectually lazy. They just don’t want politics they disagree with in their sports. There are so many examples of non-sports issues mixing with sports. ESPN has done some incredible fundraising for cancer. I don’t hear anybody say “stick to sports” when that happens. But when it’s Colin Kaepernick, racism, or police brutality, then they want to stick to sports. That has more to do with the subject than them wanting sports to be absent of heavier issues.

If this country continues down the road it’s on, we may very well one day arrive at a time when Republicans and Democrats each have their own Air Force. However, at least for now, we share the same Air Force. Therefore, a military flyover of an NFL stadium is manifestly not a political exercise. The plane or helicopter is neither a Republican or a Democrat. Nor are the political opinions of the pilot necessarily important, since he or she follows orders no matter who the president is.

While we’re explaining things that even first-graders are aware of, the national anthem is also not a political song. One would draw special attention to the word “national.” Meaning the entire nation, and not a song representing a certain political party or ideology.

Hill is correct in referring to cancer as a “non-sports issue.” However, inherent in the concept of a political issue, is the idea that there has to be another side of the argument. And, given the fact that no one other than Beelzebub and perhaps some extreme population control climate change activists are pro-cancer, that also would be categorized as a unifying and non-political issue. Which, makes it in no way relevant to a discussion about the politicization of sports.

New England Patriots Owner Robert Kraft has entered a plea of not guilty to two misdemeanor counts of soliciting a prostitute.

Kraft, 77, has also requested a jury trial in the case, according to court records in Palm Beach County, Florida. Kraft’s legal team avoided an upcoming in-person court appearance by entering the plea, Yahoo Sports reported.

The plea comes on the heels of a public apology Kraft issued last weekend.

“In deference to the judicial process, I have remained silent these past several weeks,” Kraft said in his statement on Saturday. “To correct some of the misinformation surrounding this matter, my attorney made his first public comments on Friday night. I would like to use this opportunity to say something that I have wanted to say for four weeks.”

Prosecutors offered Kraft a plea deal that included the prostitution charges being dropped in exchange for his admission of guilt and a statement that he would be convicted if prosecuted as well as paying a fine.

Despite his apology, and the county’s deal, Kraft joined a group of other defendants in the prostitution case whose lawyers said that their not guilty pleas were entered because the deal offered by the county was far more strict than deals offered in similar cases.

According to a published report, CBS broadcaster Tony Romo would like to be to the first $10 million-a-year TV sports analyst.

Sporting News media columnist Mike McCarthy reports the former Dallas Cowboys quarterback would like a raise from $4 to $10 million from the Tiffany Network.

Romo’s contract is up in 2020, but his agent is clearly interested in getting a deal done now. Or starting a bidding war when the broadcaster becomes a free agent next year. In accordance with his contract, CBS has the right to match any broadcast offer Romo might receive on the open market.

Currently, the highest paid NFL network analyst is Fox’s Troy Aikman, another former star quarterback, who makes $7.5 million-per-year.

The highest paid NFL game analyst of all time is NBC’s John Madden, a former coach, who made $8 million-a-year in his last contract, before retiring in 2009.

NFL TV ratings were up six percent this past year according to league executive Brian Rolapp, after dipping in 2017. So it could a good time for Romo to command a new deal with a spike in ad revenue.

After retiring as a player in 2017 due to a back problem, Romo went right to the CBS broadcast booth and has received a lot of praise for his acuity in analyzing live action. He consistently draws kudos for his ability to predict offensive plays before the ball is snapped.

If CBS let’s Romo out of the building, it would be a major surprise.

New York Post sports media columnist Andrew Marchand wrote in January, “Romo’s contract is up after next season, which could set up a multimillion-dollar TV free-agent sweepstakes for his services at this time next year.

“Before that can happen, CBS is prepared to give Romo a substantial raise from, according to sources, the $4 million range that he currently makes. Next year is the final season of his three-year contract. It is hard to see how he does not become the highest-paid NFL TV analyst.”

However, a source close to Romo leaked to McCarthy, “There’s even a chance the young father and husband could walk away from TV to pursue his growing business interests.”

This might just be a negotiating tactic to scare the network.

There are also rumors Romo could quit broadcasting to try his hand at professional golf. The former Pro Bowl quarterback is a scratch golfer.

“Romo’s prowess at golf is well-known,” wrote McCarthy. “He recently accepted a sponsor’s exemption to play in PGA Tour’s AT&T Byron Nelson Championship this May at his home course in Dallas. He previously won the 2018 American Century Championship pro-am in Lake Tahoe.

“Romo has toyed with the idea of joining the PGA Tour. It wouldn’t be shocking to see him walk away from TV to try his luck as a pro golfer. ”

However, Romo enjoys doing games with play-by-play man Jim Nantz, also a golf buddy, and doesn’t sound like he wants to leave CBS.

“I feel [CBS] is exactly where I should be,” Romo said in January.


UFC star Conor McGregor is being investigated in connection with an alleged sexual assault that took place in Ireland in December of 2018, the New York Times reports.

The crime was reported in Ireland, though it did not specifically name McGregor. At this time, McGregor has not been charged with a crime. In Ireland, there are laws which forbid naming rape suspects unless they’ve been convicted.

According to the Times, the accuser is a woman in her 20’s who says she was out with friends in Dublin on December 10th. Eventually arriving at the Beacon Hotel where she claims the alleged assault took place.

According to TMZ Sports:

After the alleged sexual assault, the woman went to police and filed a report — and was then taken to a nearby hospital where she was treated in the Sexual Assault Treatment Unit, according to local reports. Unclear if a rape kit was administered but it seems to be standard operating procedure for women who are treated in this particular unit. According to local reports, cops tried to obtain surveillance footage to see if they could place McGregor at the hotel at the time of the alleged incident. When approached by the media back in December, a police spokesperson said, “[Cops] are investigating an alleged sexual assault on a female which occurred in Dublin 2 in the early hours of this morning, Monday December 10th 2018.” ‘No arrests have been made and investigations are continuing.’ So far, McGregor has not commented on the allegations.

The Times published the report identifying McGregor as the “sportsman” under investigation in the incident on Tuesday, less than a full day after McGregor suddenly announced that he was retiring from Mixed Martial Arts.

March 26 (UPI) — Legendary rapper Eminem has a plan to increase success in the Alliance of American Football. He wants the league to allow fighting.

Eminem — also known as Marshall Bruce Mathers III — tweeted a message to the league Monday night, also including the Birmingham Iron and Memphis Express in his tweet.

“Dear AAF,” he wrote. “Please entertain this thought regarding the Iron and Express game: allowing the players to actually fight would be key to league’s success like hockey. I would watch every game [even through there is no Detroit team yet – hint].”

“Don’t blow it. Sincerely, Marshall.”

The Detroit native was referencing the Express’ 31-25 victory against the Iron Sunday at Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium in Memphis, Tenn. Former Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Manziel also made his AAF debut in the Express win.

Trash talk — including some from Manziel — was coming from both teams during the close clash.

Manziel responded to Eminem’s tweet by writing: “I got you.”

DEAR @THEAAF,

PLEASE ENTERTAIN THIS THOUGHT REGARDING THE @AAFIRON @AAFEXPRESS GAME: ALLOWING THE PLAYERS TO ACTUALLY FIGHT WOULD BE KEY TO LEAGUE’S SUCCESS LIKE HOCKEY, I WOULD WATCH EVERY GAME (EVEN THOUGH THERE IS NO DETROIT TEAM YET – HINT). DON'T BLOW IT.

SINCERELY,

MARSHALL — Marshall Mathers (@Eminem) March 26, 2019

Eminem’s plea for a Detroit franchise didn’t go unnoticed. AAF CEO and co-founder Charlie Ebersol also responded to the rapper’s tweet.

“Detroit is not a bad idea for a future franchise,” Ebersol said. “Let me know if you want in on it.”

Porn lawyer Michael Avenatti is still lashing out at Nike despite his arrest for allegedly trying to extort the sportswear giant.

Avenatti went on a Twitter tear accusing Nike of being uncooperative with federal authorities despite the company’s public statement that they are working closely with prosecutors, TMZ reported.

“Unless you count lying in response to subpoenas and withholding documents as ‘cooperating.’ They are trying to divert attention from their own crimes,” the troubled attorney tweeted on Tuesday.

Avenatti went on to accuse Nike of paying off PHX Suns star Deandre Ayton and his mom before he turned pro.

“Ask DeAndre Ayton and Nike about the cash payments to his mother and others,” Avenatti tweeted. “Nike’s attempt at diversion and cover-up will fail miserably once prosecutors realize they have been played by Nike and their lawyers at Boies. This reaches the highest levels of Nike.”

Bol Bol and his handlers also received large sums from Nike. The receipts are clear as day. A lot of people at Nike will have to account for their criminal conduct, starting with Carlton DeBose & moving higher up. The diversion charade they orchestrated against me will be exposed — Michael Avenatti (@MichaelAvenatti) March 26, 2019

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Major League Baseball suspended San Francisco Giants President and CEO Larry Baer without pay through July 1 after a video showed him in a physical altercation with his wife.

Commissioner Rob Manfred said Tuesday his office conducted an investigation of the events shown on a video released by TMZ of the altercation on March 1 between Baer and his wife, Pam, in a San Francisco plaza. Manfred said he also talked to Baer before making his ruling.

“I have concluded that Mr. Baer’s conduct was unacceptable under MLB policies and warrants discipline,” Manfred said. “In determining the appropriate level of discipline, I find that Mr. Baer should be held to a higher standard because as a leader he is expected to be a role model for others in his organization and community. Based on my conversation with Mr. Baer, it is clear that he regrets what transpired and takes responsibility for his conduct.”

Baer took a leave of absence after TMZ released the video. Manfred said the unpaid suspension will date back to when Baer stepped away on March 4. Baer can have no involvement with the team until he returns and also must be evaluated by an expert to determine a proper plan for treatment and counseling.


UC Irvine Coach Russell Turner was proud to tell fans and the media that he and his team taunted Oregon Ducks player Louis King, by calling him “Queen.” But not everyone thought his “anti-woman” and “homophobic” name calling was funny.

In a post-game interview, Coach Turner said, “I was saying ‘double team Queen’ to try to see if I could irritate him. And I did. And I kept talking to my team about what we wanted to do. We were calling him Queen because I knew it might irritate him.”

Turner’s admission did not sit well with many. One such critic was USA Today sports editorialist Nancy Armour, who called Turner a woman hater and a homophobe.

“That’s right,” Armour said pointedly. “A 48-year-old man showing all the maturity of an 8-year-old to try to get an edge.”

Turner went on to insist that calling Louis King “Queen” was a “sign of respect” for his abilities. But critics like Armour were not convinced.

But that makes no sense. In the history of trash talk, nobody has ever used a chess analogy as an insult. Also, Turner was trying to rattle King by … complimenting him? So if the Anteaters had played Duke this year, he would have razzed Zion Williamson by calling him “leading scorer” or “first-round draft pick?”

Others echoed Armour’s criticism.

“Of course, that’s a bunch of bull trying to rationalize his indefensible behavior,” OutSports’s Cyd Zeigler wrote. “He knew that resorting to calling a male player ‘queen’ would rely on tired homophobic and sexist tropes in sports and, as he intended, in turn, taunt his opponent.”

Louis King’s mother was none too pleased with Turner’s flavor of “respect,” either.

Ativea King took to her Twitter account to demand that Turner publicly apologize.

“Since Russel Turner decided it was ok to try and publicly humiliate my son by calling him queen although he doesn’t get fazed by it. Me and his dad as his parents would like for him to publicly APOLOGIZE to Louis. It was in poor taste. The incident is trending all over Twitter,” she wrote.

Turner eventually did apologize for his taunting. The coach released a statement on Monday:

I recognize my actions were inappropriate and insensitive. I share UC Irvine’s belief that inclusivity and diversity are paramount values, and I apologize for not understanding that my actions during the game suggested otherwise. I respect Oregon’s men’s basketball program, its student-athletes, and its coaches. Since the conclusion of the game, I have spoken to Louis, his parents, and Oregon’s head coach Dana Altman. They have graciously accepted my explanation and apology.

It all didn’t help Turner even on the court because King scored 13 of his 16 points in the second half and helped lead the Oregon Ducks to a 73-54 win over Turner’s Anteaters.

He says it was nothing more than a “sinister effort” to undermine the results of the 2016 election.

Trump says there has “never been anything like what we did” in 2016.

“We defeated a very corrupt establishment and we kept our promise to the American people, and it’s driving them crazy,” Trump says. “Today, our movement and our country are thriving. Their fraud has been exposed. The credibility of those who pushed the hoax is forever broken. And they’ve now got big problems.”

He says Mueller was a God to Democrats until he said “no collusion.” “They don’t like him so much right now,” Trump says.

A raid on a luxury high-rise residence in downtown Minneapolis Saturday resulted in the seizure of 64 pounds of methamphetamine, three pounds of heroin, and the arrests of two males–one believed to have direct ties to a Mexican cartel.

The morning raid was a result of a multi-agency operation in which investigators received information from a confidential informant that one of the defendants, later identified as Gonzalo Jiminez-Paz Jr., was planning to travel to California to finalize a large shipment of methamphetamine for delivery to Minnesota, according to an affidavit filed by the Ramsey County Sheriff’s Department. Investigators surveilled Jiminez-Paz and were able to determine that on March 19, his vehicle arrived at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport and on March 20, his cellphone was traced to Earlimart, California, according to the Star-Tribune. On March 22, investigators detected activity suggesting that Jiminez-Paz returned to his apartment in Minneapolis and the search warrant was executed the following day.

Investigators reportedly discovered two suitcases containing 70 packages of methamphetamine with a total weight of 64 pounds, three pounds of heroin inside a shoe box, a bag of unidentified blue pills, two loaded handguns, 11 cellphones, and numerous rounds of ammunition. The apartment tower overlooks the Mississippi River and is directly across the street from U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) offices.

During the service of the search warrant, investigators also arrested a co-defendant identified as Rey David Luna-Santillanes. During questioning, Luna-Santillanes reportedly told investigators that on the day that Jiminez-Paz returned to Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, they met with an unidentified co-conspirator who gave them a suitcase containing 70 packages of methamphetamine.

Gonzalo Jiminez-Paz Jr. and Rey David Luna-Santillanes, both age 22 from Minneapolis, were charged with conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine, according to United States Attorney Erica H. MacDonald.

In April 2018, the Star-Tribune reported on a series of major drug busts in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area to include the seizure of 152 pounds of methamphetamine during a traffic stop. The vehicle had departed Phoenix, Arizona, and was destined for Minnesota. The defendant in that case reportedly admitted to making 15 prior trips before being arrested. Approximately one month later, investigators seized 82 pounds of methamphetamine believed to belong to the Sinaloa Cartel.

Rio Grande Valley Sector Border Patrol agents apprehended nearly 1,700 migrants in a single day in South Texas. The apprehensions represent the largest single-day total for the sector since 2014.

Border Patrol officials said that agents assigned to the Rio Grande Valley Sector arrested several large groups of Central American migrants during a 24-hour period beginning on Monday. Rio Grande City agents patrolling near Sullivan City, Texas, apprehended a large group of 110 from Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala, according to information provided by Rio Grande Valley Sector Border Patrol officials.

A short time later, agents patrolling near Roma, Texas, came upon another large group of 98, officials said.

On Tuesday, McAllen Station agents patrolling the border near Penitas, Texas, apprehended yet another large group. This group consisted of 158 made up of family units and unaccompanied minors from Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua.

Other McAllen Station agents came upon yet another group of migrant families and unaccompanied children from Central American nations, the report continued. This group consisted of 105.

As the day continued, McAllen Station agents continued to encounter large migrant groups. The next group consisted of 123 family units and unaccompanied minors from El Salvador, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Sri Lanka.

Agents encountered a sixth group near Roma. The agents found the group walking north from the Rio Grande River border with Mexico. Officials said this group consisted of 190 — all from Central America.

Rio Grande Valley Sector officials said that the agents apprehended nearly 1,700 migrants in total. They reported this to be the largest “one-day total since 2014.” They said that if the current rate continues, the sector will surpass the number of apprehensions in 2014.

The agents transported all of the migrants to stations where they will be “processed accordingly.”

Rio Grande Valley Sector agents continue to lead the nation in the apprehension of migrant families and unaccompanied minors. In February, these agents apprehended a total of 25,355 migrants including 14,448 Family Unit Aliens and 2,904 Unaccompanied Alien Children, according to the Southwest Border Migration Report.

In addition to the more than 120,000 apprehended this fiscal year, Rio Grande Valley Sector officials said that at least 25,000 more escaped capture.

“Smugglers and traffickers have caught on that the outdated laws, lack of resources, and bad court decisions effectively give them a ‘free ticket’ into America,” U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Neilsen told the House Homeland Security Committee earlier this month. “Make no mistake: the problem is getting worse.”


A newly formed migrant caravan of more than 2,500 departed the southern Mexican border in Chiapas Saturday and is now traveling north for the U.S.

The group formed in Tapachula, Chiapas, over several weeks and is labeled the first Central American-Caribbean caravan since it includes a large number of Cubans.

The caravan departed Saturday morning at approximately 4:30 am. They spent the first night in the town of Huehuetán and later the outskirts of Huixtla. The caravan planned to reach Mapastepec by Monday, which would total approximately 65 miles since their departure on Saturday morning.

According to numbers released by Mexican immigration officials, the caravan consists of 1,199 Hondurans, 764 Salvadorans, 300 Guatemalans, 176 Nicaraguans, and 85 Cubans. Some expect the Cuban cohort to swell to 600 after immigration officials suspended the issuance of one-year humanitarian visas.

Sale nueva caravana, encabezados por cubanos y centroamericanos https://t.co/q6LO0tzXvj pic.twitter.com/aKtQ1NFIyX — Quadratin Chiapas (@quadratin_chis) March 23, 2019

The Mexican government said the visa program was suspended due to over-taxation of resources to process requests. The one-year humanitarian visas, promised by Mexico’s new President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, was a newly adopted policy which allowed migrants to legally travel and work during their stay in Mexico. The suspension stranded migrants from Nigeria, India, Cameroon, Congo, Angola, Nepal, and Haiti, according to Quadratin Chiapas.

Earlier this month, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador authorized the deployment of a coordinated security operation with the military, state, and municipal police along the Guatemalan border to fight the increase in violent crime coinciding with the arrival of several caravans since October 2018. In February of this year, a suspected MS-13 member murdered two police officers and a rival gang member.

Del Rio Sector Border Patrol agents rescued a migrant toddler who suffered seizures and convulsions after her mother carried her across the Rio Grande River on Monday. The agents treated the child at the scene and arranged transportation to a hospital.

“Del Rio Sector has seen a dramatic increase of groups with children illegally entering the country,” Del Rio Sector Chief Patrol Agent Felix Chavez said in a written statement. “The challenges faced by our agents when dealing with family units and unaccompanied children are often compounded by serious pre-existing conditions that require immediate medical care.”

Eagle Pass Station agents received a call on Monday about a child in distress on the U.S. side of the Rio Grande River near Quemado, Texas. The agents quickly responded to the scene and found a two-year-old child suffering from seizures and convulsions. Agents reported the mother of the child had just carried the girl across the often dangerous river that separates Texas and Mexico.

After providing assistance at the scene, the agents contacted local emergency services first responders who transported the girl to the Fort Duncan Regional Medical Center in Eagle Pass, Texas. Once stabilized, doctors transported the child by ambulance to the San Antonio Children’s Hospital for “more advanced care.”

“The level of cooperation we’ve received from both the Eagle Pass Fire Department and the medical staff at Fort Duncan Regional Medical Center has been nothing short of exemplary, especially during this recent rise in activity in our area,” said Chief Chavez. “I am extremely proud of our agents and the Air and Marine pilots for their quick action and response locating this child and getting her the care she needed.”

The massive numbers of migrant families and unaccompanied children crossing the border into the U.S. are placing a tremendous burden on Border Patrol agents, they say. During a speech along the border near El Paso on Wednesday, U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin K. McAleenan again sounded the alarm.

“On Monday, we saw the highest total of apprehensions and encounters in over a decade, with 4,000 migrants either apprehended or encountered at Ports of Entry in a single day. That was Monday,” McAleenan reported. “Yesterday, we broke the record again with 4,117. We are now on pace for over 100 thousand apprehensions and encounters with migrants in March, with 90 percent of those, 90 thousand people, crossing the border illegally between Ports of Entry. March will be the highest month since 2008. The arriving flows are made up primarily of Central American families and unaccompanied children.”

“In March, almost 40,000 children will come into CBP custody after completing a harrowing journey in the hands of violent and callous smugglers through Mexico,” he continued. “We are now taking up to 60 migrants a day to the hospital, including the medical facilities here in the greater El Paso region, which have done an amazing job tory to care for very sick individuals trying to cross our borders.”

“In the last four days, we’ve seen fevers of 105 degrees in infants, a two-year old suffering from seizures in the desert, a 19-year old woman with a congenital heart defect that needs emergency surgery, and a 40-year old man suffering from multi-organ failure but trying to refuse medical care,” the commissioner stated. “Our expanded medical efforts are saving lives, but they come at a high cost to our enforcement mission.”

In response to the overwhelming numbers of migrants being apprehended, Del Rio Sector officials announced on Wednesday, plans to begin releasing migrants directly after apprehension. Sector officials said the migrants will be released on their own recognizance with a notices to appear for later immigration court proceedings.

“Due to capacity issues at our stations and the ongoing humanitarian crisis nationwide, Border Patrol has begun identifying detainees for potential release in Eagle Pass with a notice to appear for their immigration hearings,” Del Rio Sector officials stated.”

CIUDAD VICTORIA, Tamaulipas – A cop and four hitmen with Los Zetas Cartel were arrested for their alleged roles in the murder of a prosecutor who ran a state anti-kidnapping unit targeting key cartel leaders.

This week, Tamaulipas state investigators arrested the hitmen who are part of the Cartel Del Noreste (CDN) faction of Los Zetas. Authorities also arrested a 15-year-old girl known as “La China” who is believed part of the cell. Officials believe the group carried out the murder of Patricia Buitron Rivera, a key figure in the fight against CDN and Gulf Cartel leadership.

Last week, a team of hitmen shot Buitron in front of her children as she was getting ready to take them to school in Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas. The attackers managed to escape, leaving the prosecutor dead inside her vehicle while her children ran screaming to neighbors for aid.

Initially, it was believed that the Gulf Cartel was behind the murder since Buitron was investigating one of the organization’s leaders and also, soon after her murder, a series of messages spread through social media where the Gulf apparently took credit for the incident. That information was later discarded following the arrest of the CDN gunmen. The new theorized motive was to destabilize the Gulf Cartel by shifting blame.

Authorities were able to identify La China inside a red Chevrolet Cobalt with another woman at the scene of the murder, a top law enforcement official revealed to Breitbart News. Investigators tracked down the young woman and also began raiding various CDN stash houses where they seized several weapons, tactical vests, body armor, and road spikes.

Authorities also arrested Edgar Eduardo “El Shagui,” Juan “El Pipas or the Pipes,” Jose Isabel “El Bebe Kilos or Baby Kilos,” and Cesar Gerardo “El Guacho or the Soldier aka Peña.” Some of the gunmen were from Nuevo Laredo and moved to Ciudad Victoria as part of the CDN’s takeover operation.

During questioning, the gunmen reportedly outed Jose Martin “Tamagotchi” Ruiz, a Tamaulipas state police officer assigned to the kidnapping unit as the one who proposed the murder and provided necessary intelligence. The assassination was to be blamed on the Gulf Cartel to re-direct heat. The plan was presented to a CDN leader known as “La Guera,” who handled the logistics for the cell in Ciudad Victoria.

As soon as La Guera learned that her hitmen were captured, she fled the city. Authorities believe she is hiding in Nuevo Laredo, directly on the Texas border. The top law enforcement official revealed that the investigations have not concluded and officials are looking at additional cops and other individuals close to the fallen prosecutor as likely accomplices.

A group of migrants allegedly assaulted a U.S. Border Patrol agent in the Del Rio Sector Monday night when they reportedly began throwing rocks to avoid apprehension. The agent sustained minor injuries after being struck in the face.

A group of Border Patrol agents from the Eagle Pass South Station began tracking a group of migrants who illegally crossed the border from Mexico. The agents caught up with the group and took one into custody, according to information provided by Del Rio Sector Border Patrol officials. The rest took off to the Rio Grande River.

While still in the water, some began throwing rocks, officials stated. One struck a Border Patrol agent in the face.

“Our agents were viciously assaulted while they were diligently carrying out their sworn law enforcement duties,” said Del Rio Sector Chief Patrol Agent Felix Chavez. “This incident is an example of the threats faced by Border Patrol agents as they work to secure our borders.”

The rock-throwing illegal aliens continued their trek back across the Rio Grande River into Mexico where they absconded.

Officials reported the agents suffered “minor bruising” after being struck in the face. Other agents provided first aid at the scene.

Border Patrol agents remain among the most assaulted of all federal law enforcement officers. During Fiscal Year 2018, 683 agents were assaulted in the line of duty, according to a report released on Tuesday by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). This accounts for 86 percent of all reported assaults against law enforcement officers operating under the umbrella of CBP.

Rio Grande Valley Sector Border Patrol officials said that at least 25,000 migrants evaded apprehension this fiscal year after illegally crossing the border from Mexico into South Texas. These are in addition to the more than 120,000 they successfully apprehended.

“Those are folks that we know made it past the infrastructure, the agents, the technology that we do have in place—because our resources are stretched so thin,” Rio Grande Valley Sector Deputy Chief Patrol Agents Raul Ortiz told the Epoch Times during an interview last week. “We actually don’t know who they are. So far, here in south Texas, we’ve apprehended folks from 44 different countries. These are from the Middle East, Southeast Asia, Yemen, Iraq, Pakistan, Iran, you name it.”

Unlike the Central American migrant families who are surrendering to the first law enforcement officer they can find after illegally crossing the border, Ortiz said that these other 25,000 migrants are “the folks that are trying to get away from our officers each and every day.”

Department of Homeland Security officials previously stated that cartel-connected human smugglers utilized the large migrant groups to tie up Border Patrol resources so that they can successfully smuggle other migrants into the U.S. without detection.

In February alone, Rio Grande Valley Sector agents apprehended 25,355, including 14,448 family units and 2,904 unaccompanied minors. These migrants take up considerable resources that would otherwise be directed toward searching for drugs and illegal immigrants avoiding arrest.

Earlier this month, Rio Grande Valley Sector agents apprehended a group of nearly 300 migrants who crossed near Granjeno, Texas. Officials said this was the largest single group they had seen so far this year. Officials said they apprehend more than 1,000 migrants that day in this single Texas sector.

“Smugglers and traffickers have caught on that the outdated laws, lack of resources, and bad court decisions effectively give them a ‘free ticket’ into America,” U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Neilsen told the House Homeland Security Committee earlier this month. “Make no mistake: the problem is getting worse.”


Border Patrol agents all along the U.S. southwestern border with Mexico continue to apprehend sex offenders who illegally re-enter the country after being deported.

Tucson Sector agents assigned to the Nogales Station arrested a 48-year-old Mexican national after he illegally crossed the border several miles west of the Mariposa Port of Entry on Sunday. The agents transported the man to the station where a biometric background investigation identified the man as Gildardo Diaz Arroyo, according to information obtained from U.S. Border Patrol officials. Further investigation revealed that a Phoenix, Arizona, court convicted the Mexican national for sexual assault of a minor in 1998. Another court convicted him of Driving Under the Influence in 2005. Immigration officers removed him from the U.S. following his convictions.

That same day, El Paso Sector agents apprehended a group of migrants who illegally crossed the border just west of the Paso Del Norte Port of Entry, officials stated. During processing, the agents discovered one of the illegal aliens has an active arrest warrant. The biometric background investigation identified the man as a 52-year-old Guatemalan national, Jose-Jose Marcos. The criminal records check revealed an outstanding warrant from a court in Gainesville, Georgia, for violation of a court order that followed his previous arrest for child fondling, child molestation, and trafficking of a person, officials reported.

The agents turned Marcos over to the El Paso Police Department who will hold him for Georgia law enforcement officials. When the agents arrested Marcos, they found him in the company of his 10-year-old U.S. citizen son. Agents turned the child over to Texas Child Protective Services “due to the nature of the arrest warrant,” officials stated.

Agents patrolling near Sunland Park on Friday morning, arrested an Ecuadorian male after he attempted to illegally cross the border. The agents transported him to the station for processing where they discovered that 22-year-old John Sebastian Yunga-Chuqui has an outstanding arrest warrant from a court in Worcester, Massachusetts. He reportedly told the agents he posted bond on the charges of rape, indecent assault, and battery. Officials turned the alleged rapist over to the Dona Ana County Detention Center in New Mexico where he will be held for extradition.

El Centro Sector agents assigned to the Calexico Station arrested a 36-year-old Honduran national after he illegally crossed the border Sunday morning near the Calexico Port of Entry. The agents discovered that a court in Arlington County, Virginia, convicted the man for Sexual Battery on February 28, 2018, and sentenced him to 12 months in jail. At some point, immigration officers deported the criminal alien and he quickly returned to the U.S.

All of the previously deported criminal aliens could be prosecuted for aggravated re-entry after removal as a previously convicted sex offender. If charged and convicted, they could each face up to 20 years in federal prison.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers seized nearly 187 pounds of heroin, fentanyl, methamphetamine, and cocaine worth $3.1 million over the weekend during three vehicle inspections at the southern Arizona. The alleged seizures resulted in the arrests of four Mexican nationals and one U.S. citizen.

The first seizure occurred on Friday evening during a vehicle inspection when CBP officers assigned to Mariposa Crossing contacted three women from Nogales, Sonora, in a Volkswagen sedan. After officers conducted a thorough search, they discovered more than 91 pounds of heroin hidden within the vehicle’s floorboard. They also discovered just over three pounds of fentanyl, 17 pounds of cocaine, and 16 pounds of meth. The three women, ages 27, 38, 25, were arrested and turned over to U.S. Homeland Security Investigations.

The second seizure occurred on Saturday night when CBP officers working the Mariposa Crossing contacted a 36-year old Nogales, Arizona, in a Lincoln SUV. A CBP K-9 led to two packages taped to his groin. One contained a quarter-pound of heroin and a half-pound of methamphetamine. The driver was arrested.

The third seizure occurred during the early morning hours on Sunday when CBP officers assigned to the Dennis DeConcini Crossing contacted a 22-year-old male from Caborca, Sonora, Mexico who was attempting to enter the U.S. in a Mazda SUV. After officers referred the driver to a secondary inspection, officers discovered several packages of drugs within the spare tire well and within the fuel tank. The packages were determined to contain methamphetamine with an approximate weight of 59 pounds valued at more than $177,000. The driver was arrested, and drugs seized and turned over to investigators of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations.

Del Rio Sector Border Patrol agents apprehended more than 500 mostly Central American migrants over the past weekend. The apprehensions included one group of 60 Honduran nationals, including women and young children.

“Our agents are encountering larger groups of immigrants including women and children,” Del Rio Sector Chief Patrol Agent Felix Chavez said in a written statement. “Until recently, groups of this size have been uncommon in the Del Rio area. Our highest priority will always be the safety of all people involved no matter the situation. However, it is a criminal offense to enter the United States at a place other than a designated port of entry. Those who choose to enter illegally will be arrested and handled accordingly.”

Agents assigned to the Eagle Pass South Station on Saturday morning apprehended a group of 56 migrants who illegally crossed the Rio Grande River border not far from a legal port of entry, according to information provided by Del Rio Sector Border Patrol officials. The group consisted of all Honduran nationals and included women and children ranging from four-months-old to 16 years.

Officials reported this is the largest group seen in the area in recent months. The sector typically averages groups of about 25 to 35 migrants.

Over the weekend, officials said Del Rio Sector agents apprehended more than 500 migrants after they illegally entered the U.S. and surrendered to Border Patrol agents.

During the first five months of Fiscal Year 2019, which began on October 1, 2018, Del Rio Sector officials reported a 5oo percent increase in the apprehension of migrant family units when compared to the same period one year earlier. The agents apprehended 5,569 migrant families this year, compared to 933 in FY2018. In February alone, Del Rio Sector agents apprehended 2,262 migrant families and 242 unaccompanied minors, according to the February Southwest Border Migration Report.


Tucson Sector Border Patrol agents apprehended nearly 400 Central American migrant families after they illegally crossed the border in the Arizona desert over the weekend. The strategy of cartel-connected human smugglers continues to tie up Border Patrol resources.

Ajo Station agents patrolling the border west of the Lukeville Port of Entry encountered a large group of migrants early Saturday morning. Agents operating mobile electronic surveillance equipment picked up the migrants as their human smugglers dropped them off along a desolate road that runs just south of the international boundary fencing, according to information obtained from Tucson Sector Border Patrol officials.

Officials reported the group consisted of 216 mostly of migrant family units (one adult with one or more children) from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.

On Monday, another large group of migrants crossed illegally. Officials reported this second group consisted of 179 Central American migrant families and unaccompanied minors.

Both migrant groups sought out agents after illegally crossing the border so they could make asylum claims.

The movement of these two large groups into the area forced Border Patrol supervisors to divert additional resources to the scene in order to transport and process the groups.

Department of Homeland Security officials previously stated that the cartel-connected human smugglers use this tactic to “flood the zone” and tie up Border Patrol resources. This enables them to move drugs and other migrants who do not qualify for asylum requests across the border without apprehension.

“Illicit transnational criminal organizations exploit the vulnerability of foreign nationals with false promises of legal status and encourage dangerous border crossings, placing lives at risk,” Tucson Sector officials said in a written statement.

Agents transported all of the 395 migrants to the Ajo Station for processing.

MONTERREY, Nuevo Leon – Mexican authorities are saying farewell to a state investigator who became the target of cartel gunmen while carrying out a narcotics probe. The gunmen are part of the Cartel Del Noreste (CDN) faction of Los Zetas, led by a known terrorist behind the 2008 grenade attack at a U.S. Consulate.

Over the weekend, friends and loved ones said goodbye to Raul Reyes Sanchez, an investigator with Nuevo Leon’s State Investigations Agency. Reyes died while conducting a drug operation in the Monterrey metropolitan area.

Reyes and another agent were investigating a drug sale spot just before he was attacked by a team of gunmen from the CDN. His partner managed to call for help. The gunmen fled the scene in a Jeep Cherokee with Nuevo Leon license plates SSZ-6657.

Paramedics rushed Reyes to a local hospital but the agent died en route due to gunshot wounds to the head and body. Authorities were able to use surveillance video to track down one of the gunmen after the team was spotted switching vehicles. Investigators confirmed the gunmen are members of the CDN after arresting one and seizing several weapons.

The CDN is led by Hector Raul “El Tory” Luna Luna, the cartel boss behind the 2008 grenade attack on the U.S. Consulate in Monterrey. Mexican authorities arrested Luna in 2010 for the grenade and his role as a top leader with Los Zetas, but he was suspiciously released by a federal judge in 2018. Since then, El Tory’s CDN has waged war with law enforcement and rival cartels to take over lucrative drug trafficking and human smuggling routes.

El Tory also threatened to blow up law enforcement buildings, Breitbart News reported. The CDN has left behind a trail of dismemberments and beheadings to intimidate rivals.

The Pentagon announced Monday evening that Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan authorized $1 billion for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) for building the border wall pursuant to the president’s emergency declaration last month.

“These funds will be used to support DHS’s request to build 57 miles of 18-foot-high pedestrian fencing, constructing and improving roads, and installing lighting within the Yuma and El Paso Sectors of the border in support of the February 15 national emergency declaration on the southern border of the United States,” the Pentagon announced in a statement.

The Pentagon also noted that 10 U.S.C. § 284(b)(7) gives the Department of Defense the authority to construct roads and fences and to install lighting to block drug smuggling corridors across international boundaries of the United States in support of counter-narcotic activities of Federal law enforcement agencies.

The Pentagon also released a letter from Shanahan authorizing the funds in response to a DHS request for support.

The letter was addressed to DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and was in response to her request for support to secure the southern border by blocking up to 11 drug smuggling corridors along the border by constructing roads and fences and the installation of lighting.

Shanahan said CBP would serve as the lead agency for environmental compliance and would be responsible for providing all necessary access to land and that the DHS would accept custody of the completed infrastructure, account for that infrastructure in its real property records, and operate and maintain the completed infrastructure.

“The Commander, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, is authorized to coordinate directly with DHS/CBP and immediately begin planning and executing up to $1B in support to DHS/CBP by undertaking the projects identified above,” he wrote.

“Additional support may be available in the future, subject to the availability of funds and other factors,” he added.

The announcement comes a day before Shanahan is due to testify to the House Armed Services Committee on Tuesday. Members of the Committee in the past have been irritated with the Pentagon for not providing timely information on the Pentagon’s support for the border.

The request — although it does not appear to come out of any military construction funds — will likely give Democrats on the committee new fodder for attacks against the administration for using Pentagon funds to build the border wall.


Five people were gunned down by suspected cartel gunmen in the northern Mexican border state of Sonora near Arizona Sunday, continuing a trend of violent activity in the region.

The five victims were reportedly standing in front of a residence drinking beer and listening to music in Caborca when several unknown gunmen arrived in multiple vehicles and opened fire with at least three different firearms, according to local reports. The suspects left three males and two females fatally wounded at the scene. Municipal and state police responded with elements of the Mexican Army. The five victims were identified as Angel Emilio “N,”(26); Misael “N,” (23); Rubén Eduardo “N,” (36); Adriana “N,” (39); and María Guadalupe “N,” (32).

The primary gunman was described as being approximately 5’5” and thin with a rifle slung over his shoulder. Caborca is roughly 80 miles from the U.S. border and the municipality stretches north to Arizona. Security elements blocked off the exits to the city in an unsuccessful attempt to locate the suspected gunmen.

Breitbart News previously reported on cartel activity related to Caborca, with numerous large seizures of methamphetamine, fentanyl, and cocaine in addition to a recent incident when cartel gunmen opened fire on state police and later abandoned an armored vehicle.

Mexican authorities are investigating a Sinaloa-based journalist’s death who was allegedly thrown from an overpass. The case marks the fifth media-related homicide of 2019 and the seventh since President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO) took office in December 2018.

On Sunday evening, law enforcement in Sinaloa responded to an overpass along the Benito Juarez Highway. Authorities processed the crime scene and collected the body of Omar Ivan Camacho, SinEmbargo.Mx reported. The body showed signs of a violent struggle. It remains unclear if he was kidnapped prior to death or if the suspects killed him before dumping the body. Camacho worked as a radio journalist covering local sports and also managed a related website. On the day of his death, Camacho reported from a baseball game and went missing thereafter.

Se implementan acciones urgentes en el mecanismo de protección a periodistas y personas defensoras de DDHH. Asesinatos del 1 de diciembre a la fecha:

→ 6 periodistas (4 presuntos responsables detenidos)

→ 9 defensores de DDHH (2 casos esclarecidos)https://t.co/NJaT98F1PQ — Gobierno de México (@GobiernoMX) March 25, 2019

The apparent murder was discovered one day before Mexico’s government spoke out about the recent deaths of four journalists in 2019. Top cabinet officials announced in a public conference for the need to change the mechanisms that Mexico uses to protect media–saying current policies are reactive rather than preventative.

Other Murdered Mexican Journalists in 2019

Rafael Urua Manriquez — the general director of Radio Kashana, a community station based in Santa Rosalia, Baja California, which reported on human rights, gender issues, alternative lifestyles, reproductive health, and ecology. He was murdered on January 21.

Jesus Eugenio Ramos Rodriguez—Longtime journalist and host of the radio show “Nuestra Region Hoy” or “Our Region Today” in Emiliano Zapata, Tabasco. Ramos was murdered by a lone gunman while having breakfast on February 10. His case remains unsolved.

Reynaldo Lopez – a radio journalist from Hermosillo, Sonora. Lopez was in a vehicle with a colleague when a team of gunmen ambushed and fired multiple times on February 16.

Santiago Barroso Alfaro—a print and radio journalist from the border state of Sonora. Barroso was gunned down while opening the door to his home in San Luis Rio Colorado on March 15.

MIGUEL ALEMAN, Tamaulipas – Cartel gunmen in Mexico used grenade launchers, improvised explosive devices, and incendiary devices in the latest clashes of a fierce war for control of key drug smuggling territories immediately south of the Texas Border. Despite the out of control violence, residents claim that soldiers from a nearby Mexican Army base largely ignored the gun battles.

Convoys of cartel gunmen in armored SUVs from a faction of Los Zetas called Cartel Del Noreste rolled into Miguel Aleman, Tamaulipas, over the weekend. The cartel gunmen sought to take control of the region from Mexico’s Gulf Cartel. The Gulf Cartel countered with its own army of gunmen that rolled out through the city streets in an attempt to fight off the CDN gunmen.

According to local residents, each time the two cartels clashed, the fighting went on for hours at a time without military forces from a nearby base arriving to stop the violence.

Both cartel factions used numerous grenades and incendiary devices in order to disable the other sides armored SUVs. The clashes left several burned-out vehicles throughout the city and the surrounding areas. Despite the raging violence, officials only found the body of one gunman left outside of a local funeral home in a pool of blood. The deceased gunman wore military-style clothing and carried several pieces of tactical gear but is not a Mexican military member.

The fighting in Miguel Aleman comes just days after cartel gunmen left an unidentified headless body and a burned-out SUV near that city. The fighting also follows several other fierce clashes in and around the region. In one of those clashes earlier this year, more than 30 cartel gunmen died with most of them incinerated in a two-day span. Last month, CDN gunmen left a chest with two human heads and a banner threatening the Gulf Cartel and Cartel Jalisco New Generation (CJNG). The CDN gunmen leaked the identity of Bartolo “El Primito” Rodarte Castillo, the leader of a Gulf Cartel faction called “Los Metros.” This is the faction currently in control of Miguel Aleman.

Venezuela’s opposition leader Juan Guaidó has called for fresh demonstrations against Nicolás Maduro’s socialist dictatorship, after the regime barred him from holding public office for 15 years.

On Thursday afternoon, regime official Elvis Amoroso announced that Guaidó would be barred from holding public office for 15 years, the maximum punishment allowable by law, over supposedly inconsistent financial transactions and illegally accepting gifts from foreign governments.

Guaidó, who leads the Venezuelan National Assembly and is recognized by Western democracies as the country’s legitimate president, responded by calling for a mass mobilization of people across the country against the Maduro regime, dubbed ‘Operation Freedom.’

“From now until April 6th we must be prepared and know what places we are going to march,” he wrote. “There will thousands of places on the day of # OperationFreedom! As Long As We continue to unite and mobilize, with all the options on the table, conversing with our allies, there is no way we can lose”:

De aquí al 6 de abril debemos estar preparados y saber de qué puntos vamos a salir. ¡Serán miles de puntos el día de la #OperaciónLibertad! Mientras sigamos unidos y movilizados, con todas las opciones sobre la mesa, conversando con nuestros aliados, no hay forma de perder. pic.twitter.com/TvT6pVhCFE — Juan Guaidó (@jguaido) March 29, 2019

Guaidó’s call comes at a time when Venezuela’s economic and humanitarian crisis continues to reach new depths, with power outages now becoming a regular occurrence across the country. Just this week, at least 16 of the country’s 25 states were hit by power outages, wreaking havoc on the already collapsing public services such as hospitals and transport.

Maduro has repeatedly blamed the recent power outages on the United States, and this week even accused President Donald Trump of orchestrating a sniper attack on a key part of Venezuela’s electrical grid.

“They knew what they were attacking … Only the North American empire has enough hatred, enough wickedness in its brain, enough perversity – has a diabolical enough mind – to order an attack like this,” Maduro said. “It was an enemy bombardment – and you can be certain Donald Trump had a hand in this … Donald Trump is obsessed with Venezuela.”

Since assuming office, Trump has taken a strong interest in Venezuela, placing multiple economic sanctions against the regime and its key entities in a bid to drive Maduro from power and instigate a transition to freedom and democracy. However, such efforts have so far proved unsuccessful, with Maduro retaining the support of the military and allies such as China and Russia.

In a statement on Friday, White House National Security adviser John Bolton accused Russia of helping consolidate Maduro’s authority, after around 100 Russian soldiers and military equipment were sent from Moscow last week.

“The Administration condemns Nicolas Maduro’s continued use of foreign military personnel in his attempt to remain in power, including the introduction of Russian military personnel and equipment into Venezuela,” he wrote. “Maduro will only use this military support to further repress the people of Venezuela; perpetuate the economic crisis that has destroyed Venezuela’s economy and endanger regional stability.”

“We strongly caution actors external to the Western Hemisphere against deploying military assets to Venezuela, or elsewhere in the Hemisphere, with the intent of establishing or expanding military operations,” he continued. “We will consider such provocative actions as a direct threat to international peace and security in the region. ”

Google has reportedly signed a deal with Cuban telecom monopoly ETECSA to improve the communist dictatorship’s Internet connectivity.

Yahoo news reports that tech giant Google has signed a deal with the Cuban telecom monopoly ETECSA in an effort to improve the island’s Internet connectivity. The deal will see an improvement to the traffic exchange between Google and the ETECSA’s networks and will overall improve internet infrastructure in the communist country.

Cuba has sought to improve its poor Internet connectivity in recent years. Cybercafes, Wi-Fi hotspots and mobile internet connections have become increasingly common across the country but users continue to complain of poor connectivity and high costs. The new Google and ETECSA partnership would see a direct “peer” network created between the Cuban and Google networks which would enable faster access to content hosted on Google servers for Cuban users.

Google and the ETECSA said in a joint press release: “The implementation of this internet traffic exchange service is part of the strategy of ETECSA for the development and computerization of the country.” The technical details of the deal were not discussed at length but it was stated that the peering connection would be implemented “when technical conditions allow it.”

Although Google has invested a significant amount of time in growing their Cuban market, analysts believe it will take some time before the U.S.-based company gains the trust of the Cuban government. President Trump has rolled back deals made by the Obama government and Cuba, tightening a trade embargo between the U.S. and Cuba but a loophole created by Obama for U.S. telecommunication companies allows Google to provide services to the communist country in attempts to further open up the country to the rest of the world.

“The signing of this memorandum evidences that the interest of U.S companies in developing businesses with ETECSA remains,” the Google, ETESCA press release stated. Former Google Chief Executive and Clinton advisor Eric Schmidt met Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel twice last year in both Havana and in Google’s offices in New York. Google has also been attempting to expand into another Communist country in China where the company is reportedly developing a state-censored search engine named Project Dragonfly.


Russia on Thursday defended its decision to send troops to Venezuela to protect socialist dictator Nicolás Maduro from any potential threat, claiming that their actions are “in strict accordance” with the Venezuelan constitution and a bilateral agreement on military cooperation.

Over the weekend, around 100 Russian troops accompanied by a cargo plane loaded of military equipment landed in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas, with the aim of protecting Maduro regime from any potential threat. The move sparked anger from the Trump administration, who have committed to ousting Maduro’s socialist regime and instigating a transition to democracy in the crisis-stricken country.

In a statement on Thursday, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that Russian troops would stay in the country as “for as long as needed” and accused the U.S. of trying to “stage a coup” in the country through the threat of military action.

“They are involved in the implementation of agreements in the sphere of military and technical cooperation,” said Zakharova. “Russia is not changing the balance of power in the region, Russia is not threatening anyone, unlike citizens in Washington whom I have just quoted.”

“Maybe U.S. politicians think that people in that part of the world should be grateful when Washington changes their leaders at its own discretion, killing those it doesn’t like,” she continued. “Or does the US think that people are waiting for it to bring democracy to them on the wings of its bombers? This question can be answered by Iraqis, Libyans and Serbs.”

Earlier this week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the U.S. “will not stand idly by as Russia exacerbates tensions in Venezuela,” raising fears of a possible military standoff.

“The continued insertion of Russian military personnel to support the illegitimate regime of Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela risks prolonging the suffering of the Venezuelan people who overwhelmingly support interim President Juan Guaido,” he said in a statement.

Meanwhile, President Donald Trump warned Russia to “get out” of the Latin American country, while reaffirming his administration’s commitment to National Assembly leader Juan Guaidó, who the U.S. and other Western democracies have recognized as the country’s legitimate president.

“Russia has to get out,” Trump said during a meeting with Guaidó’s wife Fabiana Rosales in the White House. “Venezuela was and is still a country with tremendous potential where people are starving. They’re getting killed. They’re being beaten. What’s going on there is unfathomable.”

WASHINGTON, DC — U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration is “seeking new authority to support a democratic transition” away from the murderous dictatorship of socialist dictator Nicolas Maduro that has plunged the South American country into political chaos and starvation, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told a House panel on Wednesday.

The Trump administration has led an effort in the United Nations, backed by about 50 countries, to recognize Juan Guaido as the interim president of Venezuela.

During a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing Wednesday on the U.S. Department of State (DOS) fiscal year 2020 budget, Pompeo described Guaido as the “proper leader that was designated by the Venezuelan people through their constitution.”

In written testimony prepared for House lawmakers, Pompeo declared:

As the people of Venezuela continue to fight for their freedom, the budget request includes funding to support democracy and prosperity in Venezuela. The budget also requests new authority to support a democratic transition in Venezuela, including transferring up to $500 million to foreign assistance accounts.

During the hearing, he told lawmakers that the goal of the Trump administration is to ensure “that Cuban and Russian influences are out, Maduro and his cronies are all gone, and we begin to rebuild the democracy and the world will have to provide the economic assistance to get them to this transition period. The United States will certainly be part of it.”

“We’ve seen Russia continue trying to exert influence,” he told lawmakers. “We know that the Cubans are providing some substantial support to the Maduro regime.”

Pro-Maduro Russia has reportedly deployed troops and military equipment to Venezuela in recent days. Echoing the U.S. intelligence community and the military, Pompeo warned that Russia and China are cooperating “operationally and tactically” in the South American country and beyond.

Pompeo acknowledged that a democratic transition in Venezuela would “be a long process,” adding:

The Maduro regime’s destruction of the economy in Venezuela is not as a result of the sanctions that the United States has put in place over the last months, this is years of socialist leadership that has completely put their primary revenue source, their fossil fuel resources, in a place that’s going to cost…between $6 and $12 billion and years to repair.

Pompeo appeared to agree with the assessment from Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX), the ranking member of the House panel holding the hearing, that “failure” is not an option for the Trump administration in Venezuela.

Asked by Rep. McCaul about the consequences to the United States and the Western Hemisphere if the Trump Maduro remains in power, Pompeo said:

I’m of the nature that I try not to contemplate failure too often but we have certainly considered what the risks are associated with the efforts that we provided…allowing Maduro to continue will have as its primary negative outcome — continue to with the destruction of the Venezuelan economy and real hardship for the Venezuelan people. We certainly have an importance in terms of the risk of terror, the risk of chaos in that economic [environment] and refugees flowing from those regions…so there’s lots of downside if the Venezuelan people’s objective is not achieved.

DOS has long accused the socialist regime in Venezuela of offering a permissive environment for Iran’s narco-terrorist proxy Hezbollah to freely operate in the region. The U.S. military has long warned against the activities of Iran and Hezbollah in Latin America.

Echoing Pompeo, Rep. McCaul noted that the socialist policies in Venezuela had rendered the country a failed state.

McCaul declared:

We can all agree that the socialist policies of Nicolas Maduro have turned the once rich country into a failed mafia state. With little food and medicine, millions of people are suffering more every day and forced to flee to other countries in the region. Maduro’s armed thugs are blocking the delivery of humanitarian aid. They’ve shot innocent civilians, kidnapped the Chief of Staff for interim President Juan Guaido and just yesterday Guaido’s motorcade was attacked.

Rep. Eliot Engel (D-NY), the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, did not mention the Trump administration’s efforts to stabilize Venezuela in his opening statement. He did, however, blast State’s budget request, saying:

Let me be clear: this budget request was dead the moment it arrived on Capitol Hill. I don’t know whether the Administration really believes we can mount an effective foreign policy— one that advances American interest, values, and security —- on a shoestring budget or if the people calling the shots just don’t care. But Congress won’t stand by and see American leadership on the global stage undermined. And that’s not just our opinion. That’s the power of the purse, That’s what we’re supposed to do.

Democrats control the House, which has the power to authorize spending.

Rep. McCaul did note that he agreed with the chairman that certain cuts within DOS may have “unintended consequences that cost us more in the long-term.”


Another round of power outages struck socialist Venezuela on Monday, just weeks after the crisis-stricken country experienced the worst blackouts in recent history.

According to El Nacional, power outages were reported in 16 states across the country on Monday, forcing the closure of the subway system in the capital of Caracas.

Responding to the failure in a televised address, the socialist regime’s vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez, said the outages were a result of illegal attacks on the country’s electrical grid by the “fascist right” and their “imperial masters” in Washington.

“What was the objective of this new attack? To deprive Venezuela’s people of electricity as happened so terribly just two weeks ago,” Rodríguez said, without providing any evidence for her claims. “What (last time) took days, now has been taken care of in just a few hours.”

Venezuela experienced its most severe blackout in decades earlier this month, with around 70 percent of the country receiving little to no electricity for close to a week. The situation caused chaos around the country, with widespread street demonstrations, looting sprees, and the closure of many essential public services.

Meanwhile, dozens of people died in hospitals due to a breakdown in essential medical equipment. The outage also caused considerable damage to the country’s water supply, with many people reporting what appeared to be oil-contaminated black water being pumped into their homes.

Opposition leader Juan Guaidó, who is internationally recognized as the country’s legitimate president, claimed that the last blackout caused over $400 million in losses to the country’s already strained private sector.

“We are in the middle of a catastrophe that is not the result of a hurricane, that is not the result of a tsunami,” he told CNN Español at the time. “It’s the product of the inefficiency, the incapability, the corruption of a regime that doesn’t care about the lives of Venezuelans.”

Last week, U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric added that the international body remains “very concerned” about the situation and the impact of the country’s worsening humanitarian crisis.

“We are very concerned about the serious humanitarian impact that the power outage is having in Venezuela, as well as about reported incidents of looting and violence throughout the country,” he said in a statement.

China, which has developed a predatory financial relationship with the Maduro regime, previously offered its assistance to the regime, with a spokesperson stating that Beijing is “deeply concerned” about the impact of the blackout on people’s lives.

“China hopes that the Venezuelan side can discover the reason for this issue as soon as possible and resume normal power supply and social order,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lu Kang said last week. “China is willing to provide help and technical support to restore Venezuela’s power grid.”

Italian far-left terrorist Cesare Battisti has confessed to the four murders he was convicted of before he fled the country 37 years ago to escape justice.

Batistti admitted to the killings during an interrogation with public prosecutor Alberto Nobili at the Oristano prison where he is currently being held after being brought back to Italy, Il Giornale reports.

Milan prosecutor Francesco Greco announced the confession at a press conference saying “he admitted all the charges” and took responsibility for the four murders along with a series of robberies carried out on behalf of the Armed Proletarians for Communism (PAC) terror group of which he was a member.

The far-left terrorist also allegedly apologised to the families of his victims claiming that at the time he had thought of his actions as a “just war.”

“Battisti made use of his declarations of innocence to get help from far-left organisations both in France and in Brazil. In all these years he also worked a lot, he wrote four books and lots of articles and in France, he worked for a TV station,” prosecutor Nobili said.

“He made his statements a little at a time. I can’t say that it was a flooding river, but I felt that it had a liberating effect for him,” Nobili added.

Italian populist Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, who had successfully campaigned and lobbied Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro to extradite Battisti, reacted to the confession saying, “today, after some decades, this terrorist has apologized. Better late than never.”

“I also expect the pseudo-intellectuals of the left who have covered and defended this murderer to apologise” he added.

President Bolsonaro also weighed in saying, “For years I have denounced the protection given to this terrorist, treated here as a political exile. In the elections, I signed a commitment to send him back to Italy to pay for his crimes. The new position of Brazil is a message to the world: we will no longer be the paradise of bandits!”


Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro has vowed to arrest “terrorists” undermining his leadership, raising fears that the regime could soon target opposition leader Juan Guaidó and other high-profile politicians.

Speaking at a “March Against Imperalism” rally in Caracas on Saturday, Maduro blasted the “diabolical pro-imperialist puppets” who he claimed were trying to remove him from power.

“In the coming days, we will certainly see more terrorists captured – whatever their names might be,” Maduro said. “There will be justice in Venezuela. We will not shy away from sending these crooks to jail – one by one – sooner rather than later … We have their names. We know their faces.”

Llegó la hora de un cambio profundo en los métodos de gobierno, y cuento con el apoyo del pueblo, en unión Cívico–Militar, para lograrlo. En las próximas horas designaré un nuevo gabinete que se irá a las calles a resolver los problemas, en permanente contacto con el pueblo. pic.twitter.com/zORKWtokBu — Nicolás Maduro (@NicolasMaduro) March 24, 2019

“The Bolivarian revolution will continue to lead the government and the people will continue to lead the motherland,” he continued. “There will be no empire, no puppets, no clowns and no parasites who can go against the will of the people of Venezuela.”

Maduro’s comments come days after the Chief of Staff to opposition leader Juan Guaidó, Robert Marrero, was kidnapped and detained by intelligence agents from his home on Friday morning. He has since been accused of running an anti-Maduro “terror network” that was plotting a series of political assassinations and attacks designed to remove him from power, although no formal evidence has been provided to verify that claim.

The regime’s information minister, Jorge Rodríguez, claimed on Saturday the head of that supposed network was former opposition leader, Leopoldo López, who is still serving out a sentence under house arrest for organizing mass protests against Maduro in 2014.

Solicitado con código azul x Interpol x homicidio y sicariato pic.twitter.com/ZK6V2FWn1q — Jorge Rodríguez (@jorgerpsuv) March 23, 2019

“Assassins and paramilitaries have been recruited using large amounts of money so that they can be sent to Colombia to receive training,” Maduro declared. “Marrero was involved in contracting people from Guatemala and Colombia to comply with the recruitment and training plan for assassins.”

However, any move against Guaidó himself is likely to provoke a strong reaction from the U.S., who recognize him as the country’s legitimate president with the backing of the majority of Western democracies.

Last month, Washington warned that it would be a “terrible mistake” to arrest Guaidó, with Donald Trump recently pledging to impose even tougher sanctions while also keeping “all options on the table” for removing Maduro from power.

“We hold former President Maduro and those surrounding him fully responsible for the safety and welfare of interim president Juan Guaidó and his family,” said State Department spokesman Robert Palladino. “It would be a terrible mistake for the illegitimate Maduro regime to arrest Juan Guaidó.”

Brazilian congressman Eduardo Bolsonaro, the son of the nation’s president Jair Bolsonaro, said Friday that some sort of force would be necessary to oust the reigning Venezuela dictator Nicolás Maduro from office.

Mr. Bolsonaro said that “all options on the table,” including the military option, to resolve the crisis in Venezuela, while reiterating his conviction that “Maduro is a criminal.”

Brazil was one of the first countries to declare the government of Nicolás Maduro “illegitimate” after the presidential elections in Venezuela last May 20, while affirming its support for the Venezuelan Parliament.

“No one wants a war, war is bad, there are many lives lost, there are collateral consequences, but Maduro is not going to relinquish power peacefully. In some way it will be necessary to use force, because Maduro is a criminal,” Bolsonaro said.

Action must be taken, however, he continued, because “the worst that can happen is to allow Maduro to stay in power, because every day people are dying.”

If he is allowed to continue, Bolsonaro said “we will see the birth of a new Cuba.”

Last December, Bolsonaro’s father Jair retracted an invitation to Nicolás Maduro as well as to Cuban officials to attend his presidential inauguration.

“Obviously, regimes that violate the freedoms of their peoples and act openly against the future government of Brazil because of ideological affiliation with the group defeated in the elections will not be in the presidential inauguration in 2019,” Bolsonaro said at the time. “We defend and truly respect democracy.”

Both President Bolsonaro and his son Eduardo were in the United States this week to shore up an alliance with the Trump administration.

In a joint press conference, Mr. Trump said he was “honored” to be compared to the populist Jair Bolsonaro, who has been called the “Trump of the Tropics.”

“I think there was a lot of hostility with other presidents,” Trump said. “There’s zero hostility with me.”

Mr. Bolsonaro responded in kind, thanking Trump for the meeting and praising his leadership.

“It’s an honor to be here after decades of anti-American presidents,” he said.

Referring to Trump, Bolsonaro said: “He wants an American great and I want a Brazil great too.”

The United Nations Human Rights Commissioner and former President of Chile, Michelle Bachelet, has expressed concern over the deteriorating human rights situation in Venezuela, yet also criticized U.S. sanctions against the Maduro regime designed to cripple their access to financial resources.

Bachelet, who as President of Chile maintained warm diplomatic relations with the Maduro regime, highlighted the “dramatically deteriorating economic and social rights” of Venezuelan citizens, amid a time of political and economic crisis that has left millions of people in need of humanitarian assistance.

In a statement Wednesday, Bachelet confirmed her office had sent human rights observers into Venezuela to investigate reports of “possible extrajudicial executions” by regime security forces against political dissidents.

“It appears that some of these killings have followed a similar pattern,” she said. “They take place during illegal house raids carried out by the FAES, which subsequently reports the death as resulting from an armed confrontation – although witnesses report the victims were unarmed.”

“I am also concerned about increasing restrictions on freedom of expression and of the press in Venezuela, and the allegations that the authorities have arbitrarily used the law against hatred, adopted in November 2017, to prosecute journalists, opposition leaders and anyone expressing dissenting opinions,” she continued.

However, Bachelet also criticized sanctions imposed by the United States targeting the Maduro regime’s access to financial resources, arguing that they are also hurting the Venezuelan people. Nearly three million people have fled the country since 2015, placing extra pressure on neighboring Latin American countries such as Colombia and Brazil.

“I am concerned that the recent sanctions on financial transfers related to the sale of Venezuelan oil within the United States may contribute to aggravating the economic crisis, with possible repercussions on people’s basic rights and wellbeing,” she said.

Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Carrie Filipetti said that the sanctions were not intended to harm the Venezuelan people but instead an attempt to instigate a democratic transition in the crisis-stricken country.

“We have tried to target our sanctions as much as possible so that it can affect the regime but leave the individual Venezuelans as untouched as possible,” she told reporters. Sanctions imposed so far have targeted state-run industries such as oil and gold mining, although President Donald Trump warned earlier this week that they could get a “lot tougher” in the weeks to come.

The Chief of Staff to Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó was kidnapped by intelligence agents during a pre-dawn raid, an indication that the Maduro regime may be preparing to step up their crackdown on leading opposition activists.

In a message posted Thursday morning, Guaidó revealed members of the regime’s intelligence agency SEBIN raided the houses Chief of Staff Roberto Marrero and congressman Sergio Vergara, who is a member of Guaido’s Popular Will party, but only took Marrero away.

“They [the regime] have kidnapped my chief of staff, Robert Marrero,” he wrote on Twitter. “We don’t know where he’s been taken. He needs to be released immediately.”

According to Vergara, Marrero claimed that SEBIN had planted two guns and a grenade in the run-up to the arrest, so they could charge him with holding illegal firearms.

Esta madrugada el régimen usurpador allanó ilegalmente mi residencia y la de @ROBERTOMARRERO, jefe de despacho del Presidente @jguaido, LO SECUESTRARON y le sembraron armas. La lucha por la mejor Venezuela continua. Este nuevo atropello nos da la fuerza para seguir adelante. pic.twitter.com/Y7XRAcwVlT — SERGIO VERGARA G. (@SergioVergaraG) March 21, 2019

Responding to the arrest, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pledged to hold those responsible “accountable” for the arrest but did not provide further details.

“The United States condemns raids by Maduro’s security services and detention of Roberto Marrero, Chief of Staff to Interim President [Juan Guaidó],” he wrote. “We call for his immediate release. We will hold accountable those involved.”

The arrest now raises concerns about the safety of Guaidó himself, who was appointed as Head of the Venezuelan National Assembly in January and is now recognized by most Western democracies as the country’s legitimate president

Since his appointment, Guaidó has attempted to energize the country’s disunited opposition, encouraging the country’s widespread opposition to engage in acts of civil disobedience, which include supporting efforts to deliver U.S. humanitarian aid from Colombia into and around the country.

Last month, the U.S. warned that it would be a “terrible mistake” to arrest him, as the Trump administration continues to impose economic sanctions on the regime’s financial resources.

“We hold former President Maduro and those surrounding him fully responsible for the safety and welfare of interim president Juan Guaidó and his family,” said State Department spokesman Robert Palladino last week. “It would be a terrible mistake for the illegitimate Maduro regime to arrest Juan Guaidó.”

President Donald Trump met with Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro on Tuesday in the Oval Office.

The two leaders exchanged soccer jerseys from their respective countries, as Trump recalled the greatness of legendary Brazilian soccer champion Pelé.

Trump said he was “honored” to be compared to Bolsonaro, who was described as a “Trump of the Tropics” during his conservative populist campaign that propelled him to victory, shocking the Western hemisphere.

The leaders expressed hopes for an improved relationship between the two countries, despite friction in the past.

“I think there was a lot of hostility with other presidents,” Trump said. “There’s zero hostility with me.”

Bolsonaro thanked Trump for the meeting and praised his leadership.

“It”s an honor to be here after decades of anti-America presidents,” Bolsonaro said. Referring to Trump, he added, “He wants an American great and I want a Brazil great too.”


Cuban doctors working in the crisis-stricken country of Venezuela have revealed that the socialist regime told them they must only provide essential medical treatments to those supporting the sham election campaign of dictator Nicolás Maduro.

According to a report in the New York Times, which has repeatedly taken money from the Maduro regime in exchange for publishing anti-American advertisements, 16 doctors involved in Cuba’s medical missions in the country were told they must deny treatments to those opposing the regime and go door-to-door in impoverished neighborhoods and offer treatment to those who still support the socialist revolution.

One doctor detailed how he was warned not to treat a 65-year-old patient in need of emergency care for his heart failure because the required oxygen tanks had to be preserved for guaranteeing the support of potential voters in last May’s sham presidential election, where opposition candidates were banned from participating.

“I asked myself, ‘Why is a physician, someone who is meant to be on a humanitarian mission, having a part in who wins an election?’” said one doctor on the condition of anonymity. “This is called tampering. There is no other word for it.”

Another doctor, dental surgeon Dr. Carlos Ramírez, spoke of how they were left disgusted by such an obvious violation of the Hippocratic Oath.

“You arrived with vitamins and some pills for blood pressure,” said Ramírez, who has since defected to Ecuador. “And when you started to gain their trust, you started the questions: ‘Do you know where your voting place is? Are you going to vote?’”

Many Cuban doctors work in Venezuela as part of an agreement between the two regimes. Venezuela typically pays for the doctors in vast quantities of oil, an initiative that began under Hugo Chávez and Fidel Castro and still continues to this day.

“With [late President Hugo] Chavez it had been hard, but with Maduro, starting in 2013, it was worse,” another Cuban doctor told the Times. “It became a form of blackmail: ‘You’re not going to have medicine. You’re not going to have free health care. You’re not going to have prenatal care if you’re a pregnant woman.’ ”

Medical internationalism has also been a key aspect of the Cuba foreign policy, with the regime sending around 52,000 medical workers in humanitarian missions to over 90 countries. Yet Cuban doctors have long complained that their work is effectively a form of slavery that forces them to earn negligible salaries as Cuban communist regime pockets a majority of profits.

According to a lawsuit filed by dozens of Cuban doctor in Brazil last year, benefitting countries pay Havana directly for the medical services while the doctors are provided with a stipend that barely covers living expenses.

Venezuela’s vital oil industry is on the brink of total collapse following a nationwide blackout that has further deepened the country’s economic and humanitarian crisis, the International Energy Agency warned this weekend.

The nationwide blackout began earlier this month, with around 70 percent of the country receiving no electricity whatsoever. Although power has now been largely restored, the situation wreaked havoc across the country, closing public services, and causing hundreds of millions in losses for private companies, including the state-run oil industry.

“The electricity crisis in Venezuela has paralyzed most of the country for significant periods of time,” the IEA wrote in a post this weekend. “Although there are signs that the situation is improving, the degradation of the power system is such that we cannot be sure if the fixes are durable.”

“Until recently, Venezuela’s oil production had stabilized at around 1.2 mb/d,” the post continues. “During the past week, industry operations were seriously disrupted and ongoing losses on a significant scale could present a challenge to the market.”

If correct, the collapse in production will likely further cripple Venezuela’s economic crisis, with oil representing 90 percent of the country’s total export revenue. Production recently fell to under one million barrels a day, compared to 3.2 million barrels a day when Hugo Chávez seized power in 1998.

Following nearly 20 years of socialist rule, Venezuela’s economic crisis is now so severe that thousands of people are fleeing the country every day in search of work and often in need of humanitarian assistance. There are also chronic shortages of gasoline, a product long subsidized by the regime as part of their socialist agenda.

Another major factor in the collapse of Venezuela’s oil production has been the exodus of workers from the country’s state-run oil company Petroleum of Venezuela (PDSVA), which was subject to a military takeover by Chavista General Manuel Quevedo in 2017. According to multiple reports, Quevedo’s loyalties and lack of prior experience have alienated many workers, many of whom have already left due to low morale and a constant depression of their wages.

Such a collapse in oil production has also had a significant impact on the Cuban economy, which is now receiving just 55,000 barrels per day at preferential rates as part of an economic alliance between the two countries. Both countries are also suffering under the pressure of U.S. sanctions, which include trade and oil embargos designed to weaken their respective regimes.

The socialist regime in Venezuela claims power has been fully restored following a nationwide blackout that plunged the troubled country further into crisis.

Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, Venezuelan Information Minister Jorge Rodrigues said that normal activities were ready to resume. “President Nicolas Maduro has decided to resume work activities throughout the country,” he said. “School activities remain suspended for another 24 hours.”

The blackout started last Friday, with around 70 percent of the country plunged into darkness and receiving little to no electricity, and became the longest and most severe power out in Venezuelan history. The situation sparked further chaos around the country, with widespread street demonstrations, looting sprees, and the closure of most essential public services. Meanwhile, dozens of people died in hospitals due to a breakdown in essential medical equipment.

The Maduro regime has repeatedly blamed the attacks on the United States, accusing the U.S. government of carrying out an “electronic coup” designed to further weaken his regime. He has yet to provide any evidence for the claim.

“The cruel attack that the U.S. empire has carried out against the electrical system has been detected and progressively reversed, thanks to the effort of Venezuelan experts and hackers who are working hard to restore tranquility to People,” Maduro declared this week.

According to journalists on the ground, power has indeed been restored to most parts of Caracas, but not everywhere. There are still problems severely affecting the country’s water supply system, with the blackout damaging the quality of water entering people’s homes, with many people reporting what appeared to be oil-contaminated black water coming being bumped into their homes.

Opposition leader Juan Guaidó, recognized internationally as the country’s legitimate president, told CNN that the crisis has already caused $400 million in losses to the country’s private sector.

“We are in the middle of a catastrophe that is not the result of a hurricane, that is not the result of a tsunami,” he said earlier this week. “It’s the product of the inefficiency, the incapability, the corruption of a regime that doesn’t care about the lives of Venezuelans.”

Meanwhile, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said on Thursday that the international body remains “very concerned” about the situation and the worsening humanitarian crisis affecting the country.

“We are very concerned about the serious humanitarian impact that the power outage is having in Venezuela, as well as about reported incidents of looting and violence throughout the country,” he said in a statement.

WASHINGTON, DC— El Salvador’s President-elect Nayib Bukele on Wednesday pledged to completely “end” the emigration of Salvadorans to the United States who are “forced” to leave by a lack of economic of opportunities and gang-linked violence, noting that the exodus of people is “really shameful for our country.”

The president-elect delivered a speech at the conservative Heritage Foundation and subsequently spoke to the think-tank’s Daily Signal news outlet.

Bukele also vowed to “end” gangs like Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and its rival Barrio 18 (18th Street) and stop the flow of deadly drugs trafficked to the United States through El Salvador.

The president-elect said he is ready to “refuse” U.S. foreign aid “handouts” in favor of “jumpstarting commerce” between the United States and El Salvador.

Bukele declared:

Some countries would come to the United States and ask for handouts. But a handout is like giving a drug addict money who will go out and buy drugs. We don’t want any handouts. Actually, I’m ready to refuse aid if we will jumpstart commerce. We are ready to do business with the United States our greatest and most powerful ally.”

In February, Bukele won a landslide election as a third-party outsider vowing to jumpstart the economy, crack down on corruption, as well as fight gang-fueled violence. His victory ended the two-party system’s three-decade stranglehold over the Central American country.

He said there is “common ground” on immigration between U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration and El Salvador, adding, “We know the [primary] origin of emigration is lack of opportunities and violence in our countries.

Bukele vowed to completely halt “forceful emigration” from El Salvador to the United States during his first term, telling the audience of mostly Salvadoran expatriates:

We’re going to end emigration, forceful emigration and we want the United States to help. Not because they’re going to send us aid, but because it’s a common interest. We want our talents to stay in El Salvador, and we want some of the talent to come back. …The fact is we should be ashamed of that — why people are leaving our country.

In the interview with the Daily Signal, the president-elect elaborated further what he means by “forceful emigration,” noting that unlike “professional emigration,” it is “caused by other factors, like, for example, lack of opportunities or violence or both of them, both of those factors.”

“This is really shameful for our country, ” he stressed.

Conceding that stopping emigration is “a gigantic job,” Bukele highlighted steps he plans to take to end the practice, telling the Daily Signal, “You have to provide opportunities, you have to provide jobs, and you have to provide security.”

Latin America is the top source of illicit narcotics, including cocaine and opioids fueling the unprecedented number of fatal drug overdoses in the United States. Some of those drugs pass through El Salvador on their way to the United States from South America.

“We are committed to stopping 100 percent of the drug trafficking that comes through El Salvador and to the United States,” Bukele told the audience.

In his interview with the Daily Signal, Bukele also pledged to demolish the gangs in El Salvador, noting that they are responsible for 80 percent of the country’s homicides.

Referring to the gangs, he proclaimed:

They are a quasi-state because they function like a … they collect taxes. They provide security…but the fact is that these organizations, they have to end. …We haven’t done it because the previous administration and the current administration have been focusing on stealing money.

Bukele distanced himself from the leftist regimes of Venezuela, Nicaragua, and China. However, he said his politics “transcends ideology.”

Although Mexico remains the largest source of U.S. immigrants, El Salvador has been one of the top sources of legal and illegal immigration to the United States in recent years. In recent months, there have been caravans of thousands of people from the Northern Triangle — El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala — hoping to enter the United States at any cost. The majority of the immigrants from El Salvador are living in the United States illegally.


The Chinese government has offered to help restore power to Venezuela, as the country continues to suffer from the longest and most severe blackout in its history.

At a press conference in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang repeated unsubstantiated claims made by the Maduro regime that the power grid had collapsed as a result of a hacking attack.

“China is deeply concerned about this,” Lu said. “China hopes that the Venezuelan side can discover the reason for this issue as soon as possible and resume normal power supply and social order. China is willing to provide help and technical support to restore Venezuela’s power grid.”

China enjoys a close relationship with the Maduro regime, having provided numerous loans and credit lines in exchange for access to the country’s extensive oil reserves. However, many believe officials in Beijing are concerned about the impact of Venezuela’s humanitarian crisis on their reputation, and as a result have avoided expressing explicit support to Maduro.

Last month, opposition leader Juan Guaidó, who is also Venezuela’s internationally recognized president, urged China to drop its tacit support for Maduro, saying that relations would improve if Venezuela underwent a democratic transition.

“What most suits Russia and China is the country’s stability and a change of government,” he told Reuters. “Maduro does not protect Venezuela, he doesn’t protect anyone’s investments, and he is not a good deal for those countries.”

Maduro and other regime officials have repeatedly blamed the United States and the country’s opposition for the attack, which has wreaked havoc on the already crisis-stricken country.

“The cruel attack that the U.S. empire has carried out against the electrical system has been detected and progressively reversed, thanks to the effort of Venezuelan experts and hackers who are working hard to restore tranquility to People,” he said on Tuesday.

The blackout began last Friday, plunging around 70 percent of the country into darkness and with no access to electricity. Many parts of the country are still without a fully functioning power supply, making it the longest and most severe blackout in Venezuelan history.

The situation that has already sparked considerable civil unrest, with nearly all essential public services closed and dozens of people have died in hospitals because of the lack of power. The situation has also had an impact on the size of political demonstrations, as many people lacking basic necessities have insufficient energy to attend.

“Venezuelans are being completely consumed by the search for the basics,” journalist Domingo Alvarez told Bloomberg. “We are forced to pay for the inaction and mistakes caused by this government. Sadly, protesting is now secondary.”

At least six people were killed during a Brazil school shooting Wednesday when two gunmen opened fire.

The school was located in Suzano, a São Paulo suburb.

Thomas Reuters Foundation News reports that five of the dead were children and the sixth was an adult.

The two gunmen, who were reportedly adolescents, are also dead. KARE 11 reports that the two gunmen “killed themselves” after opening fire on others.

BBC reports that the gunmen “hooded themselves” before attacking, leaving a number of wounded in addition to fatalities.

The University of Sydney’s GunPolicy.org labels Brazil’s overarching gun control policy as “restrictive.” Brazil requires residents to obtain a license before they may “acquire, possess or transfer a firearm or ammunition,” and such residents must show good cause for obtaining the license before it will be issued.

Moreover, the minimum age for obtaining a license is 25 and the process for securing a license entails “a background check which considers criminal, mental health and employment records.” Third party character references are also part of the process of acquiring a license to own a gun.

Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro continues to blame the United States for the nationwide blackout that has further crippled the crisis-stricken country and has warned that “more attacks” could be on the way.

In a television address on Monday, the socialist dictator said that said that the recovery from power outages would take place “little by little,” adding that the outage was an “electronic coup” carried out by “criminal minds” on behalf of the U.S. government.

“The cruel attack that the U.S. empire has carried out against the electrical system has been detected and progressively reversed, thanks to the effort of Venezuelan experts and hackers who are working hard to restore tranquility to People,” he wrote on Twitter.

“I ratify my admiration for the heroic Venezuelan people who resist with courage and bravery this art attack against the tranquility of the fatherland,” he continued. “I call on social and political organizations to maintain active resistance that promotes solidarity and protects the peace.”

The power outage began last Friday, with around 70 percent of the country plunged into darkness and receiving little to no electricity, making it the longest and most severe blackout in Venezuelan history.

The situation that has already sparked considerable civil unrest, with reports of street demonstrations, mass lootings and the closure of most essential services. Meanwhile, dozens of people have died as a result of the blackout as hospital equipment failed without power.

Last week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo rejected any claims of U.S. involvement, saying the crisis was a result of the Maduro regime’s “incompetence.”


Blackouts and power shortages in Venezuela have now entered their fourth day, as the crisis-stricken country’s economic and humanitarian crisis continues to deepen.

The power outage began last Friday, with around 70 percent of the country receiving little or no electricity at all, making it the longest and most severe blackout in the country’s history. The situation that has already sparked considerable civil unrest, with incidents of mass lootings and the closure of nearly all public services.

“Drive around Caracas, and you see long lines of cars, waiting for hours at the few gas stations still operational,” NPR’s Philip Reeves reported from Caracas. “Motorists park on highways, cell phones aloft, searching for a signal. The rich have taken refuge in luxury hotels. The poor stand in lines in the street,” Reeves added.

Around 17 people have already died as a result of the blackout as hospitals struggle to operate without power, as opposition leader Juan Guaidó accused the Maduro regime of murdering its own citizens.

“Venezuela has truly collapsed already,” Guaidó said in an interview with CNN on Sunday. “There is no service in the hospitals. These were the best hospitals in the country. If we are in the capital what is it like kilometers inside Venezuela where there hasn’t been or there has been very little gasoline with periodic cuts in electricity, without basic goods, with inefficient public transportation? You can say with all responsibility that Venezuela has already collapsed.”

“I can’t call it anything else, due to lack of electricity,” he continued. “Imagine if, in your country, you wake to the news that there’s been four days without electricity because they steal from electricity plants and 17 people died. That’s murder.”

As noted by the BBC, “without the internet, mobile phones, banks, credit-card machines, electric cookers or air-conditioning, ordinary life is bordering on the unbearable for many people, especially in low-income communities.”

Meanwhile, the Maduro regime has blamed the United States for the blackout, claiming without evidence that they conducted cyber attacks against the country’s national grid.

“The national electrical system has been subject to multiple cyber attacks,” Maduro wrote on Twitter on Sunday. “However, we are making huge efforts to restore stable and definitive supply in the coming hours.”

Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) has accused President Donald Trump and his envoy to Venezuela Elliott Abrams of lying about the humanitarian crisis faced by the country, as the White House steps up its efforts to remove the Maduro regime from power.

The far-left Congresswoman, who is a fierce opponent of regime change in the crisis-stricken country, maintains the U.S. should instead try to promote a “dialogue” with Venezuela and other left-wing governments including Mexico, Uruguay, and Bolivia.

“Trump and Elliott Abrams cannot be trusted to tell the truth about what’s happening in Venezuela,” Omar wrote on Twitter. “We must continue to question the narratives they provide and promote dialogue instead of intervention.”

Omar’s comments follow a report by The New York Times purporting to show members of the anti-Maduro opposition accidentally set a humanitarian aid convoy, sent by the U.S. and other regional contributors, alight after throwing a molotov cocktail at security forces attempting to block its passage into the country.

The footage contradicted appeared to contradict initial reports shared by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) and White House National Security adviser John Bolton that the Venezuelan military were responsible for deliberately burning the aid convoys. Both Bolton and Rubio are currently leading U.S. efforts to isolate the Maduro regime, with the Treasury Department imposing a range of sanctions on senior regime officials as well as the country’s vital oil industry.

It is not the first time that Omar has weighed in on the crisis. Earlier this year, she falsely accused the Trump administration of trying to install a “far-right” leader in replace of Maduro, after the U.S. joined dozens of Western democracies in recognizing opposition leader Juan Guaidó (whose Popular Party is actually affiliated with the Socialist International) as the country’s legitimate president.

“A US-backed coup in Venezuela is not a solution to the dire issues they face,” she wrote in January. “Trump’s efforts to install a far-right opposition will only incite violence and further destabilize the region. We must support Mexico, Uruguay & the Vatican’s efforts to facilitate a peaceful dialogue.”

Caracas (AFP) – Venezuela’s opposition leader Juan Guaido on Saturday called for a nationwide march on Caracas to crank up the pressure on embattled President Nicolas Maduro, as the country endured its third night largely without power.

The massive blackout crippling the oil-rich but economically troubled South American nation has fueled the political standoff between Guaido, who is recognized as Venezuela’s leader by more than 50 countries, and Maduro, who is clinging to power.

No national data was available about the impact of the power outage, but an NGO said at least 15 patients with advanced kidney disease died after they stopped receiving dialysis treatments in darkened hospitals.

As night fell Saturday, the power across much of the country — which first went off Thursday — was still not on. Businesses remained shut, hospitals struggled to operate, and public transport barely functioned.

The 35-year-old Guaido, the head of Venezuela’s National Assembly, earlier told thousands of supporters that he would soon embark on a nationwide listening tour before leading a march on the capital.

“Once we’ve finished the tour, the organization in every state, we’ll announce the date when all together, we’ll come to Caracas,” Guaido said, a megaphone in his hand as he stood on the roof of a pickup truck.

Security forces had prevented the opposition from setting up a stage at their original protest site, arresting three people.

“Miraflores, Miraflores!” chanted Guaido’s supporters in response — a reference to the presidential palace currently occupied by Maduro.

Guaido, who proclaimed himself president of the country of 30 million people in January and says Maduro’s May re-election was illegitimate — wants to set up new polls.

He threatened to authorize an outside military intervention “when the time comes,” pointing to the constitution, which authorizes “the use of a Venezuelan military mission abroad, or foreigners inside the country.”

“All the options are on the table,” he said, borrowing a phrase from US President Donald Trump.

– ‘We will never surrender’ –

Maduro also rallied his supporters. Wearing red, they protested against “imperialism” at a march that marked four years since the United States branded Venezuela a “threat” to its security and imposed sanctions.

“Today, more than ever, we’re anti-imperialists. We will never surrender!” Maduro wrote on Twitter.

He said almost 70 percent of power had been restored by mid-day, when a “cyberattack” was reported at a major power plant.

“That disturbed and undid everything we had achieved,” he said.

Both the pro-Guaido and the pro-Maduro rallies ended without major incident.

– ‘A lot of distress’ –

It is one of the worst and longest blackouts in recent memory in Venezuela, which is already suffering from shortages of food and medicine due to the overarching economic crisis.

Problems have been exacerbated by hyperinflation that the International Monetary Fund says will reach 10 million percent this year.

An estimated 2.7 million people have left the country since 2015.

“I’ve spent three nights in a lot of distress. I’m very anxious because the situation is not getting resolved, the little food that we have in the fridge is going to spoil,” said Francisca Rojas, a 62-year-old retiree living in Caracas.

“How long are we going to put up with this?”

– ‘I share the despair’ –

Communications Minister Jorge Rodriguez blamed the initial power outage on a cyberattack against the Guri hydroelectric plant in the country’s south, which serves 80 percent of Venezuela.

Critics blame the government for failing to invest in maintaining the power grid.

Hospitals have since reported terrible problems, and those with generators were using them only in emergencies, while flights were canceled, leaving hundreds of travelers stranded at airports.

The Caracas subway, which transports two million people a day, remained shuttered.

Francisco Valencia, director of the Codevida health rights group that reported the 15 deaths, said some 10,200 people were at risk because dialysis units had switched off.

“We are talking about 95 percent of dialysis units, which today likely hit 100 percent, being paralyzed, due to the power outage,” he said.

Late Saturday, entire families parked their cars along the main highway in Caracas in the hopes of capturing faint cell phone service to check on loved ones and get the latest news.

“My son and my brother live outside Venezuela, and they want to hear from us,” said Bernadette Ramirez, who came with some neighbors to the highway.


Venezuela literally shut down on Friday as a massive nationwide blackout rolled into a second day, causing schools and business operations to close. Socialist dictator Nicolas Maduro blamed the blackout on sabotage “directed by the imperialist United States” and carried out by agents of the Venezuelan opposition.

The main hydroelectric power plant in Venezuela failed on Thursday, kicking off what has become the longest nationwide blackout in over 30 years. By Friday morning, Reuters was able to find only one city, Puerto Ordaz, that was still running electric lights.

The Associated Press reported 22 of 23 states in Venezuela were affected, notably including the capital of Caracas, which usually avoids the worst effects of the nation’s periodic rolling blackouts. The situation was made worse by the unfortunate timing, as the lights went out during peak evening rush hour in the crowded capital city, causing enormous traffic jams.

Reuters noted Venezuela’s national oil company PDVSA did not respond to questions about whether the vital oil industry has been crippled by the blackout.

The workday was officially suspended for other businesses and schools were closed. Hospital staff worked by candlelight, first responders worked to rescue people trapped in elevators, and at least one inbound international flight was turned back when backup generators at the Caracas airport failed.

Maduro, as is his habit, blamed the blackout on his political opponents and their supporters in the United States.

“The electrical war announced and directed by the imperialist United States against our people will be defeated!” he declared on Twitter, although most of his captive population was unable to read the message because the power is out.

The AP described Venezuela’s “normally hyperactive social media” as “eerily silent,” other than Maduro’s fulminations. Angry citizens responded with a more primitive form of social media by opening their windows and screaming curses at Maduro.

The Miami Herald said on Friday that the blackout has triggered one of the largest computer network collapses ever seen in Latin America. The Herald report suggested the blackout might actually work to Maduro’s advantage by shutting down the Venezuelan Internet, which the regime has struggled to control with increasingly heavy-handed censorship tactics.

Maduro officials fanned out to describe the cause of the blackout as an “attack” on the Guri Dam hydroelectric plant perpetrated by “criminals” and “right-wing” agents determined to “sabotage” the power grid.

Communications Minister Jorge Rodriguez was more specific, claiming the Guri Dam was shut down by a “cyber attack” launched by Venezuelan right-wing extremists at the direction of U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL).

“What’s the intention? To submit the Venezuelan people to various days without electricity to attack, to mistreat, so that vital areas would be without power,” Rodriguez thundered.

Rubio responded to Rodriguez on Twitter, with tongue planted firmly in cheek:

Tonight the “Baghdad Bob” of #Caracas @jorgerpsuv revealed I caused the nationwide & ongoing electric power outage in #Venezuela. My apologies to people of Venezuela. I must have pressed the wrong thing on the “electronic attack” app I downloaded from Apple. My bad. https://t.co/5oZURMSnrB — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) March 8, 2019

No this is not Dr. Evil from the movie Austin Powers. This is “Caracas Bob” @jorgerpsuv,the #MaduroRegime information minister, revealing how I personally sabotaged a hydroelectric plant & caused a massive nationwide blackout. https://t.co/O3BShe6Jum — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) March 8, 2019

Rubio proposed an alternative culprit for the blackout, a Japanese national noted for damaging urban infrastructure to spotlight what his admirers have described as “the folly of man”:

A few weeks ago the #MaduroRegime blamed iguanas for causing a large electric grid blackout. We have now received the first video of what caused tonight’s unprecedented nationwide blackout in #Venezuela: #SinLuz pic.twitter.com/TnYevG2GA0 — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) March 8, 2019

Rubio then grew more serious and reminded the world of who really destroyed Venezuela:

#MaduroCrimeFamily stole all the money they should have invested in maintaining the power grid. Now #Venezuela is on its 14th hour of a nationwide blackout. God help the babies in incubators & dialysis patients & others for whom this is life threatening. — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) March 8, 2019

Venezuelan opposition leader and internationally-recognized interim president Juan Guaido also struck back at the Maduro regime on Twitter, using the #SinLuz hashtag (“Without Light”) to pin responsibility for the blackout on the “usurper in Miraflores” – a reference to the Venezuelan presidential palace.

“Sabotage is stealing money,” Guaido charged, turning Maduro’s allegations back against him. “Sabotage is burning food and medicine. Sabotage is stealing elections.”

“This blackout demonstrates the incompetence of the usurper. The recovery of the electricity sector, and the country, comes with the end of the usurpation,” Guaido said, noting Venezuela enjoyed huge energy reserves and the best power grid on the continent before the socialist takeover.


White House National Security adviser John Bolton has threatened sanctions against foreign banks dealing with the socialist regime in Venezuela, as the Trump administration steps up its efforts to remove dictator Nicolás Maduro from power.

In a statement, Bolton announced that the U.S. would start examining foreign financial institutions to determine whether they provide serves with the Maduro regime. American institutions are already prohibited from dealing with the regime in any capacity.

“The United States is putting foreign financial institutions on notice that they will face sanctions for being involved in facilitating illegitimate transactions that benefit Nicolas Maduro and his corrupt network,” it continued. “We will not allow Maduro to steal the wealth of the Venezuelan people.”

Bolton also reiterated the U.S.’s support for opposition leader Juan Guaidó, who was appointed in January as the country’s legitimate president by the Venezuelan National Assembly, a move that has since been recognized by Washington and the majority of western governments.

“The United States strongly supports the democratic transition in Venezuela led by Interim President Juan Guaido and the National Assembly and is pursuing several new diplomatic and economic initiatives in support of that transition,” the statement continued.

This week, Guaidó returned to Venezuela following a trip to Colombia to discuss the country’s ongoing political, economic, and humanitarian crisis with other regional leaders. On Tuesday, he called for further demonstrations against the regime this weekend, urging supporters to let Maduro know that the “pressure has barely begun.”

In an interview with Fox Business on Tuesday, Bolton confirmed that White House is still considering imposing a fresh round of sanctions on the regime, having already imposed multiple economic sanctions on senior regime officials and the country’s vital state oil industry.

“Economic sanctions that have already been imposed on Venezuela are crippling the oil economy, which has always been its major source of revenue,” Bolton said. “We’re looking at new sanctions, new measures, to tighten our grip on Maduro’s financial wherewithal, to deny his regime the money that they need to stay in power.”

American journalist Cody Weddle was released by the Maduro regime and expelled from Venezuela on Wednesday night after spending ten hours in captivity. Weddle said his captors seemed particularly upset about a report he filed about rank-and-file Venezuelan soldiers preparing to switch their allegiance to internationally-recognized interim president Juan Guaido.

Weddle’s account of his ordeal, published by his employers at WPLG News in Florida, described a group of “black-clad agents with bulletproof vests and an order signed by a Venezuelan military judge” bursting into his home early on Wednesday and carting him off to an interrogation chamber.

“Weddle said he was held for several hours alone with a ski mask covering his face. Weddle said guards searched his cellphone and computer and would sporadically question him about his work. He was not hurt, but he said he was without food and water during the interrogation,” WPLG reported.

“It was clear they didn’t like my reporting. They were interested in a story I did about the current atmosphere in the armed forces,” Weddle said.

The reporter said his interrogators came from a Venezuelan counter-espionage agency and accused him of “treason, espionage, and removing military artifacts.”

“They wanted to know about the work I did, who I worked with. They wanted to know what kind of military people I’ve spoken to; what type of opposition politicians I know; who were the opposition politicians I spoke to in the past few days,” the New York Times quoted Weddle.

Weddle said his interrogation was videotaped and he was prodded to make statements for the camera that Guaido is not the legitimate president and Venezuela’s woes are due to U.S. sanctions.

He said his captors grew nervous as international criticism of his detention mounted and eventually decided to let him go. His assistant Carlos Camacho, who was arrested at the same time as Weddle, was released shortly before he was.

Weddle said his personal electronics were searched by interrogators but eventually returned to him. The bulk of his personal possessions were left behind in his Caracas apartment, to which he will apparently not be permitted to return.

Republican Senator Rick Scott of Florida, who strongly denounced Weddle’s arrest, told the Maduro regime to stop intimidating journalists:

.@WPLGLocal10’s reporter has been released. Maduro and his thugs need to know: the U.S. will not stand for threats against journalists. Hoping @coweddle has a safe return home! https://t.co/OUu2vjxIa4 — Rick Scott (@SenRickScott) March 7, 2019

Florida’s other senator, Marco Rubio, expressed similar criticism of Nicolas Maduro for intimidating reporters:

UPDATE: @coweddle has been released by #MaduroRegime after he was kidnapped in an early morning raid & held for 12 hours. He is being deported to the U.S. They do this for one reason alone, to intimidate journalists from reporting on @jguaido & on conditions in #Venezuela. https://t.co/cPaaZbrsQ7 — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) March 7, 2019

The U.S. State Department also pressured Maduro to release the journalist:

.@StateDept is aware of and deeply concerned with reports that another U.S. journalist has been detained in #Venezuela by #Maduro, who prefers to stifle the truth rather than face it. Being a journalist is not a crime. We demand the journalist’s immediate release, unharmed. — Kimberly Breier (@WHAAsstSecty) March 6, 2019

Guaido called out Maduro for arresting Weddle, saying the reporter was “kidnapped by a regime that usurps functions and tries, without success, to hide the truth of what is happening in our country.”


Left-wing filmmaker Michael Moore sent kind words to the late Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez Tuesday, reminiscing on how the political strongman compared former president George W. Bush to Satan.

“10 yrs ago, the ‘Capitalism: A Love Story’ crew w/ fan-boy Hugo Chavez,” Moore said, posting a photo of him and his crew along with Chavez.

“At the UN he called W. the Devil and claimed he could tell Bush was nearby because he could smell the sulfur Satan emits. Hilarious. Loved how he drove the heads of our military-industrial complex crazy.”

Indeed, Moore is a longtime fan of Chavez. In 2013, he proclaimed, “Hugo Chavez declared the oil belonged 2 the ppl. He used the oil $ 2 eliminate 75% of extreme poverty, provide free health & education 4 all.”

Venezuela has seen a rapid downturn over the last few years.

At CPAC last week, Vice President Mike Pence used it as an example of socialism’s failings, saying, “Today, more than nine out of ten people live in poverty in that once-rich country. More than three million Venezuelans have abandoned their homes and fled the brutality of the Maduro regime.”

“But the struggle in Venezuela is between dictatorship and democracy. The struggle in Venezuela is between socialism and freedom.”

Moore is unabashed in his love of socialism. The Bowling for Columbine director recently heaped praise on Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), calling her the “leader” of the Democratic Party.

The 64-year-old also said that Democrats need to “stop being moderate.”

“There’s no halfway point to, should someone be paid a living wage? ‘Well, I’m a moderate, so I think they could be paid half of a living wage,'” he said.

“You know–on the issue of choice. There’s no halfway there. You’re either for it or you’re against it. You know, do you believe in equal rights for women? Do you believe we should have an equal rights amendment? Yes or no? There’s no middle ground. This is no time for moderation.”


Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro has vowed to defeat the “crazed minority” currently attempting to remove him from power, as tensions continue to mount in the crisis-stricken country.

Speaking at the sixth anniversary of the death of his socialist predecessor, Hugo Chavez, on Tuesday, Maduro declared that he would overcome those pushing “hatred” against his regime.

“While a crazed minority continues with their hatred, with their bitterness, it’s their problem. We won’t pay attention to them, compatriots!” he said. “Let the crazy minority continue with their bitterness, we’ll defeat them. For Chavez, we’ll do it. For the great history of the country, we’ll do it.”

Maduro’s comments came as 35-year-old opposition leader Juan Guaidó, who is internationally recognized as the country’s legitimate president, attempts to rally his supporters back on to the streets after returning from a trip to Colombia.

“Thank you all for the affection and the immense warmth with which we were greeted,” Guaidó wrote on Twitter. “I call on the country to mobilize again this Saturday 9th March. All the support we have received and the backing we need will depend on us being on the streets.”

“They thought the pressure had already maxed out,” he added. “They better know that the pressure has barely begun.”

Gracias a todos por el cariño y el calor inmenso con el que nos recibieron. Convoco al país a movilizarse nuevamente este sábado #9Mar . Todo el apoyo que hemos recibido y el respaldo que necesitemos dependerán de que nos mantengamos en las calles. ¡Vamos muy bien, Venezuela! — Juan Guaidó (@jguaido) March 4, 2019

Meanwhile, Maduro also called for “anti-imperialist marches” on Saturday in response to the opposition protests.

“Next March 9 is the four-year anniversary of the infamous Obama decree, that Venezuela is a threat,” Maduro declared. “That day will be decreed as the day of anti-imperialism and we will go to the streets this Saturday, March 9.”

In an interview with Fox Business on Tuesday, President Donald Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton revealed that White House is considering imposing a fresh round of sanctions on the Maduro regime, as they steps up their efforts to remove him from power and begin a democratic transition.

“We’re looking at new sanctions, new measures, to tighten our grip on Maduro’s financial wherewithal, to deny his regime the money that they need to stay in power,” Bolton said.

“I think Guaidó’s return was very significant. There was no effort by the military to arrest him, I think in large part because Maduro and his gang feel that if they tried to arrest him the military might’ve disobeyed the order and that really would’ve been a crisis for Maduro,” he continued “Popular support for Guaidó remains intense. The effect of our economic sanctions is still digging.”

Freelance reporter Cody Weddle was reportedly detained on Wednesday by forces loyal to Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro. Weddle’s home was allegedly raided and his Venezuelan colleague Carlos Camacho was arrested as well. U.S. officials noted the report and called on Maduro to release Weddle immediately.

The Miami Herald described Weddle, 29, as a native of Virginia who has lived in Caracas since 2014. In addition to writing for the Herald, he has worked for television news networks such as ABC News and South Florida’s WPLG.

WPLG confirmed Weddle’s arrest on Wednesday, quoting sources who said he was targeted in an “early-morning raid.” One of those sources was his housekeeper, who said Weddle’s “passport, other documents, money, and a large suitcase” were taken with him.

WPLG’s report implied Weddle might have drawn Maduro’s ire by filing an on-air report Monday night about the return of opposition leader Juan Guaido, who is recognized by the United States and many other countries as the legitimate interim president of Venezuela. Weddle also wrote a post on Twitter describing Guaido’s return as “triumphant.”

Juan Guaido with a triumphant return to Caracas. But his path forward remains uncertain. For @WPLGLocal10 >> https://t.co/e9sokSKHCh — Cody Weddle (@coweddle) March 5, 2019

The station said Weddle’s last contact was on Tuesday afternoon and attempts to reach him on Wednesday have been unsuccessful.

“We are working through various channels to get as much information as we can and to see that Cody is released. Cody has been dedicated and committed to telling the story in Venezuela to our viewers here in South Florida. The arrest of a journalist doing his job is outrageous and unacceptable,” WPLG President Bert Medina stated on Wednesday.

Florida’s two Republican senators, Rick Scott and Marco Rubio, issued statements noting Weddle’s arrest. Scott said the arrest was “unacceptable” and demanded Maduro release him immediately:

Completely unacceptable for @NicolasMaduro and his thugs to detain @WPLGLocal10’s Cody Weddle for reporting on the successful return of the legitimate Venezuelan President @jguaido. He must be released immediately and the U.S. will not stand for this kind of intimidation! https://t.co/IiR0qpXO51 — Rick Scott (@SenRickScott) March 6, 2019

According to the Miami Herald, U.S. officials have “confirmed they are aware of Mr. Weddle’s detention and are monitoring it closely.”

The Venezuelan Ministry of Communication did not respond to the Herald’s request for comment on the case.


Russia is ready to engage in bilateral talks with the United States over what it describes as America’s “flagrant interference” and “destructive influence” in chaos-ridden Venezuela, the Kremlin’s foreign minister reportedly told his U.S. counterpart in a telephone conversation over the weekend.

The Kremlin’s foreign ministry reportedly provided an account on its website of the March 2 phone call between Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

“In connection with Washington’s proposal to hold bilateral consultations on the Venezuelan topic, it was stated that Russia is ready to participate in this,” the ministry proclaimed in the statement, according to the Reuters news wire agency.

It was “vital to be strictly guided by the principles of the UN Charter since only the Venezuelan people have the right to determine their future,” the statement added.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration and other dozens of other countries have recognized opposition Venezuelan leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela’s interim president over socialist dictator Nicolas Maduro.

Meanwhile, Russia has maintained its support of what it considers to be the “legitimate government” of Maduro whose regime has plunged the country into a humanitarian catastrophe and chaotic security conditions between troops loyal to the dictator and members of the opposition.

Russian-backed Maduro has blocked the entry of much-needed food supplies and other humanitarian aid provided by the United States through Venezuelan neighbors and U.S. allies Brazil and Colombia.

During his conversation with Pompeo, Lavrov rebuked “the American threats against the legitimate government” in Venezuela, accusing the Trump administration of “flagrant interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state and the shameless violation of international law,” according to the Agence France-Presse (AFP) news wire agency.

“The provocation and external destructive influence, under the hypocritical pretext of humanitarian aid, has nothing to do with the democratic process,” the Russian FM argued.

Trump administration officials reportedly initiated the phone call over Venezuela.

Under President Trump, the United States has intensified pressure against the drug trafficking and Hezbollah terrorist-linked dictator Maduro and his allies, imposing numerous sanctions on officials tied to the regime.

In talks with Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez in Moscow on Friday, Lavrov reportedly vowed that Russia would maintain its support of the Maduro regime, providing aid supplies to Venezuela.


Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) dodged a reporter’s question Monday when asked if she denounces Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro amid the socialist country’s worsening humanitarian crisis.

Ocasio-Cortez took questions from the media during a press conference for the opening of her new office in Queens. Asked for her thoughts on Venezuela and the Maduro regime, the self-avowed democratic socialist acknowledged that a crisis was indeed occurring and called for any solution to be centered on the Venezuelan people — but expressed concern about potential U.S. intervention.

“I think that this is absolutely a complex issue,” Ocasio-Cortez began. “It’s important that we approach this very carefully. Myself, just like anyone else, is absolutely concerned with the humanitarian crisis that’s happening, and I think that any solution that we have centers the Venezuelan people and centers the democracy of Venezuelan people first.”

“I am very concerned about U.S. interventionism in Venezuela, and I oppose it,” she continued, before criticizing U.S. Special Representative for Venezuela Elliott Abrams’s handling of the issue and attacking his role in the Iran-Contra scandal. “He’s pleaded guilty to several crimes relating to Iran-Contra and I don’t think that we should be, you know, I am generally opposed to U.S. interventionism as a principal, but particularly under this administration and under his leadership I think it’s a profound mistake.”

Ocasio-Cortez is the latest Democrat to face questions regarding Venezuela’s deteriorating state of affairs. Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has come under fire in recent weeks for refusing to refer to Maduro as a dictator. In a CNN town hall this month, Sanders defended the move, saying that while Venezuela’s latest election was not democratic, “there are still democratic operations taking place” in the country. Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) has criticized Sanders’ reluctance to call Maduro a dictator and accused the disputed Venezuelan president of running an “absolute dictatorship and a narco traffic state.”

“Dictatorship is dictatorship — whether from the right or left. Dictatorship oppresses their people. I’m really surprised that Senator Sanders could not at least call him a dictator,” Menendez told CNN’s John Berman.


Pope Francis and Moroccan King Mohammed VI launched a joint appeal Saturday, urging the protection of the status quo of Jerusalem as the common patrimony of “the followers of the three monotheistic religions.”

The appeal was released in the midst of the pope’s two-day visit to Morocco and asserts the two leaders’ concern for “the unique and sacred character of Jerusalem / Al-Quds Acharif” as well as “its spiritual significance and its special vocation as a city of peace.”

“We consider it important to preserve the Holy City of Jerusalem / Al-Quds Acharif as the common patrimony of humanity,” the appeal states, “and especially the followers of the three monotheistic religions, as a place of encounter and as a symbol of peaceful coexistence, where mutual respect and dialogue can be cultivated.”

In late 2017, Pope Francis issued a similar appeal calling for respect for the “status quo” in Jerusalem following the news that the United States would transfer its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to the Holy City.

“My thoughts now turn to Jerusalem,” the pope said. “I cannot remain silent about my deep concern for the situation that has been created in the last days.”

“At the same time, I would like to make a heartfelt appeal for everyone’s commitment to respect the city’s status quo, in conformity with the pertinent United Nations Resolutions,” he said.

“Jerusalem is a unique city, sacred to Jews, Christians and Muslims, who venerate the Holy Sites of their respective religions there, and it has a special vocation to peace,” the pope added.

Last November, the pope met with the president of Israel in the Vatican to discuss Israeli-Palestinian relations as well as the “Jerusalem question.”

According to a Vatican press release, the two leaders discussed the resumption of negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians “so as to reach an accord respecting the legitimate aspirations of both peoples” as well as “the Jerusalem question,” in its religious and human dimension for Jews, Christians, and Muslims.

The Jerusalem question entails “the importance of safeguarding its identity and vocation as City of Peace,” the communiqué stated.

In their joint appeal Saturday, the pope and the Moroccan president called for the protection and promotion of “the specific multi-religious character, the spiritual dimension and the particular cultural identity of Jerusalem / Al-Quds Acharif.”

“It is our hope, therefore, that in the Holy City, full freedom of access to the followers of the three monotheistic religions and their right to worship will be guaranteed, so that in Jerusalem / Al-Quds Acharif they may raise their prayers to God, the Creator of all, for a future of peace and fraternity on the earth,” they said.

The Jerusalem Post reports: United States government maps are slated to be redrawn to reflect US President Donald Trump’s official recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, according to a report by Voice of America.

A State Department spokesperson told VOA that the map changes would be “consistent” with Trump’s declaration, although he did not indicate how long it would take to make this change. US Special Representative for Iran, Brian Hook, said the government would release them “as soon as they are ready.”

Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria during the 1967 Six-Day War and annexed it in 1981. Until now, no member of the international community has officially recognized Israeli sovereignty in the area. Since Trump made his decision – first announced on Twitter – and his declaration – signed a ratified a few days later – 14 out of 15 United Nations Security Council member states condemned the move. Syrian Ambassador to the United Nations Bashar Jaafari told reporters the move was a “flagrant violation of international law.”

TEL AVIV – Israeli officials slammed the European Union over its “shameful” rejection of Israeli sovereignty on the Golan Heights, despite President Donald Trump signing an order of recognition earlier this week.

In an English-language video message posted on Twitter, Education Minister Naftali Bennett attacked European countries, saying “Shame on you.”

He added that Israel would continue fighting radical Islam all over the world even though Europe doesn’t “deserve it.”

Shame on you, Europe! pic.twitter.com/6cLYvHdCcH — Naftali Bennett בנט (@naftalibennett) March 27, 2019

“The EU announced that it would not recognize the Golan Heights as part of the State of Israel,” Bennett said.

“We could add to that the fact that the EU does not recognize Jerusalem as our capital,” he said.

“The Golan Heights and Jerusalem and the Land of Israel has been the home of the Jewish people thousands of years before France was the home of the French and the United Kingdom the home of the British,” Bennett said.

“So we will continue building our amazing country. We will continue defending the free world from radical Islam, even though you do not deserve it,” he added.

Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon called EU officials “peace refuseniks.”

“We now allow those who keep the Iranian terror regime’s economy afloat to preach morality to us. Israel will not be held hostage by peace refuseniks and the policies of the Axis of Evil,” he said.

“The whole world knows that the Golan Heights is an inseparable part of the Land of Israel and the State of Israel,” Kahlon added.

However, head of the leftwing Meretz Party, MK Tamar Zandberg, asserted that U.S. recognition was a mistake since it introduced the issue on to the global agenda.

“Trump’s election gift to Bibi has started to cost us dearly. Now the EU is clarifying its position on the Golan Heights. Why did these demons have to be awakened on a subject that was not even on the table?” she said.

“Instead of making needless statements on the Golan Trump should publish his peace plan so that each party can relate to it,” she added.

The overall consensus in Israel, even among leftwing elements, is that the Golan Heights must remain a part of Israel since it is a strategic plateau critical to the country’s security.

On Monday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with Trump at the White House and witnessed the signing of a presidential order recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, a move the Israeli leader said deserves “enormous applause.”


TEL AVIV – At least seven Iran-affiliated militia fighters are said to have been killed in an airstrike attributed to Israel on an Iranian base near the northern Syrian city of Aleppo, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported on Thursday.

Syria’s official news agency SANA reported that the Assad regime’s air defense batteries opened fire on “hostile Israel missiles” and managed to intercept several missiles targeting industrial bases close to the Nayrab military airport, which is adjacent to the city’s international airport. According to those reports, the only damage caused was to materials.

According to SOHR, the alleged Israeli strikes hit the military airport, used by Tehran, and “ammunition stores belonging to Iranian forces and allied groups, and caused huge explosions.”

It is the second time within a year that Israel has targeted the airport and surrounding bases.

Israel has conducted hundreds of strikes against Iranian targets in Syria in recent years, although there has been a significant decrease following an Israeli strike in September that resulted in Syrian forces downing a Russian plane, killing 15 Russian crew members. Russia blamed Israel for the incident.

The blasts also caused a power cut in Aleppo, Syria’s second largest city.

Israel did not comment on Wednesday night’s strikes but Acting Foreign Minister Yisrael Katz appeared to issue a confirmation when he said on Thursday that “as far as Iran knows, it’s Israel” that conducted them. He also said it was a “challenging” mission to carry out.

Earlier this year, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Iran to “get out of Syria” unless it wanted to continue being attacked by Israel. “I’m telling you, get out of there fast. We won’t stop attacking,” he said.

Last month, the Israeli premier met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow to discuss curbing Iranian military entrenchment in Syria.


JERUSALEM – Despite initially claiming that the rocket launched from Gaza that leveled a private home in central Israel on Monday was a “mistake” and that Hamas had “no interest” in firing projectiles at Israel, the terror group’s official TV station continued to air calls to murder Israelis, telling Palestinians to “scatter the enemies’ body parts, make the skulls fly in the sky.”

Hamas’ Al Aqsa TV, which Israel officially deemed a terrorist organization earlier this month, aired a music video calling for the resumption of suicide bombings and for Palestinians to “stab, bomb, and make eyes weep,” according to a translation by Palestinian Media Watch, which first reported on the video.

“Wrap the explosive belt around you. … Oh brave one,” the song lyrics read. “Blow up the Zionists.”

The footage includes images of actual terror attacks including three stabbings, two car rammings, and bombings. Fatima Omar Mahmoud Al-Najjar, who at 59 was the oldest Hamas female suicide bomber when she blew herself up near Israeli soldiers in 2006, injuring two, is also featured on the video.

The song opens with brief interviews with released female prisoners, one of whom attempted to carry out a suicide attack. Wafa Al-Bis explained that she sought to “kill as many Jews as possible.”

The other said: “I can’t live beside Israel. There are people who can live in peace beside Israel. I can’t live in peace because it occupied my land.”

Another music video also aired during Hamas’ rocket barrage on Israel called for the Jewish state’s death and to “turn [Israelis] into body parts, roast them.”

“The soldiers of Muhammad have started to return,” the song says while showing images from Israeli funerals. “Be red death. Have no mercy on the army of aggression.”

That music video was also broadcast on Al Aqsa TV last November, a half hour before Israel bombed the TV station’s headquarters.

The Hamas-run TV network was designated a terror organization after it was found by the Shin Bet security service to be broadcasting hidden messages and cues in order to direct terror attacks. It was revealed that Gaza-based journalists on the channel had been acting as operatives of Hamas’s Izz ad-Din al-Qassam military wing, and used gestures and quotes from the Quran to relay messages to terrorists.

The network was designated a terror group by the U.S. in 2010.

On Monday, a rocket fired the Gaza Strip leveled a private home in central Israel, injuring seven people, including three children.

The attack prompted a response from the IDF which struck dozens of terror targets in the Strip. On Monday evening and Tuesday, more rockets were fired into Israel, triggering more retaliatory strikes. Wednesday saw relative clam restored.


The Times of Israel reports: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu published an election campaign video Thursday showing a contentious meeting he had with former US president Barack Obama and touted his defiance versus the American leader.

The video clip, which was taken from the PBS documentary “Netanyahu at War,” shows footage from the May 2011 Oval Office meeting between Obama and Netanyahu, with the narrator saying the prime minister “lectured” the US president on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. During the Oval Office meeting, in front of the media, Netanyahu spoke directly to Obama about the complex status of Jerusalem and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Commentators in the PBS documentary were shown describing Netanyahu’s behavior toward Obama as “outrageous” and “humiliating” for the US president. Relations between Netanyahu and Obama were known to be strained throughout the overlap between their terms in office. Netanyahu shared the video on his personal Twitter feed.


DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Three Saudi women were granted temporary release from prison on Thursday, nearly a year after they and other women’s rights activists were detained by security forces who report to the kingdom’s powerful crown prince.

Two people told The Associated Press that Aziza al-Yousef, a grandmother and former professor; Eman al-Nafjan, a mother of four and linguistics professor; and a third woman, Roqaya al-Muhareb, had been granted temporary release after bail hearings on Thursday.

The official Saudi press agency reported that three female detainees had been released but did not identify them. It said their cases were ongoing.

At least one of the women was already home with her family, according to details provided to the AP.

The move could mark a turning point for other women’s rights activists still detained, notably because two of those released, al-Yousef and al-Najfan, were vilified in state-linked media as traitors and foreign enemies soon after their arrest in May.

Thursday’s development comes as Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman continues to face widespread international criticism over the assassination of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul last year in an operation planned by two of the prince’s top aides. Eleven men are on trial in Saudi Arabia for the killing.

Since Khashoggi’s grisly murder, the imprisonment of the women activists has drawn widespread criticism from members of the U.S. Congress, the British Parliament and other Western capitals. Nine U.S. senators urged King Salman in a letter last week to release political prisoners to demonstrate “belated yet welcome respect for human rights.”

At least 10 women’s rights defenders remain imprisoned, including Loujain al-Hathloul, Hatoon al-Fassi, Samar Badawi and Naseem al-Sada. More bail hearings are expected next week.

Most of the women had appeared in a Riyadh courtroom on Wednesday to submit their defense. Several people with knowledge of the cases said the women have been charged in connection with their efforts to promote women’s rights and of having contact with accredited foreign reporters, diplomats and human rights groups.

In the presence of their husbands, parents and children, the women told a panel of three judges about the physical and sexual abuse they say they were subjected to by masked interrogators during their imprisonment.

The government has denied charges of abuse as “wild claims” that are “simply wrong.”

Prior to their arrest, several women said they received calls from an aide to Prince Mohammed telling them not to speak to foreign media outlets. Several were surprised to also learn they had been barred from leaving the country. Concerned for their safety, the women stopped posting on Twitter and other social media sites.

As activists faced pressure to keep silent, credit for social reforms like the decision to allow women the right to drive had largely gone to the crown prince.

The women’s arrest in May — a month before Saudi women were allowed to drive — may have also been a way to convey that top-down decision-making, and not activism, determines the scope and pace of change in Saudi Arabia.

The women activists had long pushed for the right to drive. They also called for an end to restrictive male guardianship laws, which give male relatives final say over a woman’s ability to travel abroad, obtain a passport, marry or undergo certain medical procedures.

In their second court hearing Wednesday, nearly a dozen of the women on trial in Riyadh told the presiding judge how they were caned on their backs and thighs, electrocuted and waterboarded by masked men who did not identify themselves.

One of the women said that several men, who seemed intoxicated, appeared late one night and took her from her place of detention in Jiddah to a nearby secret location. It was there that the women say they were tortured.

Some women have said they were forcibly touched and groped, made to break their fast during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, and threatened with rape and death. One of the women attempted suicide, according to information provided to the AP by people with knowledge of the cases.

Journalists working for foreign media, diplomats and other independent observers have not been allowed to sit-in on the hearings.


CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — An Israeli team aiming to land a spacecraft on the moon in two weeks can now expect more than glory if it works. How about a cool $1 million?

The XPrize Foundation announced Thursday it’s offering a $1 million award for a successful lunar landing.

Israel’s privately financed spacecraft Beresheet — Hebrew for “In the Beginning” — launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, last month. It’s on track to land on the moon April 11, which would make Israel only the fourth country to successfully pull off a lunar landing.

SpaceIL, the Israeli nonprofit behind Beresheet, made the final cut in the $20 million Google Lunar XPrize competition, which ended last year without a winner. The new award was inspired by SpaceIL’s perseverance.


The United Nations Security Council unanimously condemned President Donald Trump’s decision to recognize the Golan Heights as part of Israel territory, citing a violation of previous council resolutions.

All 14 speakers at Wednesday’s council meeting opposed the decision taken by Trump last week, who said that “[a]fter 52 years it is time for the United States to fully recognize Israel’s Sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which is of critical strategic and security importance to the State of Israel and Regional Stability!”

Israel’s sovereignty over the area has long been a source of international debate. Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria during the 1967 Six-Day War and imposed Israeli law on the territory in 1981, effectively annexing the area. Syrian forces temporarily overran sections of the Golan Heights during the 1973 war, but they were ultimately defeated in what amounted to an unsuccessful attempt to destroy Israel.

After 52 years it is time for the United States to fully recognize Israel’s Sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which is of critical strategic and security importance to the State of Israel and Regional Stability! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 21, 2019

“This unilateral action does nothing to assist in finding a long-term peaceful solution to the conflict in the Middle East,” said South Africa’s U.N. Ambassador Jerry Matjila.

At a time when Iran seeks to use Syria as a platform to destroy Israel, President Trump boldly recognizes Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Thank you President Trump! @realDonaldTrump — Benjamin Netanyahu (@netanyahu) March 21, 2019

“If anybody feels any temptation to follow this poor example, we would urge them to refrain from this aggressive revision of international law,” added Russia’s Deputy Ambassador Vladimir Safronkov.

The European Union also rejected the move, writing in a statement Wednesday that it was the “unanimous position” of all 28 member states not to change their stance in line with U.N. resolutions that class the area as an occupied territory.

Earlier this month, the State Department referred to the area in its annual global human rights report as “Israeli controlled,” marking a distinct shift in tone from having previously labeled the area as “occupied.”

As explained by Breitbart News’s Aaron Klein, there are a variety of reasons why the Trump administration has decided on such a move, including the fact it advances U.S. security interests and the safety of Israel from hostile forces.

“As a key U.S. ally, Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights serves as a pro-Western anchor to ensure against Iranian, Syrian and Russian designs in the area,” Klein noted. “Besides Iran, Russia is the other main powerbroker in Syria, where Moscow maintains major military installations including its massive naval facility in Tartus and the Khmeimim, Tiyas and Shayrat airbases.”

British police have made three arrests after a leaked dossier on anti-Semitism within the Labour Party was leaked to a radio station, who passed the files on to law enforcement.

The file of an internal Labour Party investigation into anti-Semitism by its own members was leaked to London-based talk radio station LBC last year, and contained alleged social media posts by Labour activists.

BREAKING: Veteran Labour MP Frank Field Resigns, Slams Anti-Semitism and ‘Racist Party’ https://t.co/PWFJJOu97Q — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 30, 2018

Allegations include the long-term anti-Semitic bullying of a child by a Labour councillor. Some of the messages recorded in the report were extreme and violent in nature, and included claims such as “We shall rid the Jews who are a cancer on us all [sic]” and “Zionist extremist MP who hates civilised people about to get a good kicking”.

Three people have now been arrested on the basis of the information, reports The Times, who were identified only as two men in their 50s in Tunbridge Wells and Birmingham, and a London woman in her 70s. The paper reports that the three are no longer Labour Party members, and that the party released a statement supporting the work of police.

The arrests come after years of growing scrutiny of anti-Semitic behaviour within Labour, which has appeared to surge under hard-left, pro-Palestine leader Jeremy Corbyn. Breitbart London reported in 2018 that the frequency and severity of anti-Semitic incidents within the party had become so pronounced that Corbyn’s leadership made that year’s Simon Wiesenthal Center list of anti-Semitism worldwide.

BREAKING: Globalist MPs Break Off from Labour, Form 'Independent Group' https://t.co/qJRai1m8Mw — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 18, 2019

In their annual report, the group said the prospect of a left-wing Labour government in the United Kingdom represented no less than an “existential threat to Jews” and said Mr Corbyn was “directly responsible” for “injecting the world’s oldest hatred into the mainstream of society”.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has also criticised the anti-Semitism crisis within Labour, speaking this week to label their handling of the issue a “national disgrace”.

The ongoing scandal was one of the contributing factors to the minor party split earlier this year, which saw nine members of Parliament decide to go their own way, citing anti-Semitism — eight going to a new splinter party, The Independent Group (TIG), and one becoming an independent.

Responding to the defections, Mr Corbyn insisted that Labour was a natural ally to those fighting anti-Semitism.

Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) failed to appear at Wednesday’s hearing at the House Foreign Affairs Committee during testimony by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Breitbart News has confirmed.

Omar’s appointment to the committee in January was controversial, given her history of anti-Israel and antisemitic rhetoric, and her support for the anti-Israel “boycott, divestment, sanctions” (BDS) movement, which Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) theoretically opposes.

Since landing on the committee, Omar has caused even more controversy with a slew of antisemitic remarks that Pelosi and other leaders have struggled to defend. Pelosi, however, has resisted pressure to remove Omar from the committee.

In her own defense, Omar published an op-ed in the Washington Post earlier this month outlining her foreign policy views, citing her experience as a refugee and calling for an “inclusive foreign policy — one that centers on human rights, justice and peace.

Given the chance to argue for those views before Pompeo, however, Omar was curiously absent.

Breitbart News reported that Pompeo told the committee that Omar’s remarks had created problems for the U.S. abroad, though he did not name her directly: “Language used by members of Congress matters. These countries all around the world are listening to you all they’re watching. They’re watching to see if this a whole of United States government process. They’re watching voices even if sometimes those voices are outliers. They don’t always know what to make of it.”

Omar was not present at the time — and she does not appear to have attended the hearing at all.

She appears, however, to have attended a hearing of the House Budget Committee, on which she also sits:

As a refugee, I know American exceptionalism is about more than military might. It's about making sure everone has a stable, healthy life. Trump’s budget:

-Slashes student loans— when 41% of veterans are carrying student debt pic.twitter.com/Ef1a10QRMH — Rep. Ilhan Omar (@Ilhan) March 27, 2019

Earlier this week, Omar attacked Pelosi for her “use of language” criticizing BDS in a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), which Omar has criticized in antisemitic terms.

It is not known if her absence from the committee was related to that argument.

(AFP) Nice, FRANCE — A French pilot hailed for bravery during a hijacking drama targeting Jews on an Air France flight in 1976 has died aged 95, his son told AFP on Wednesday.

Michel Bacos (pictured above, right) died in the southern city of Nice, where he had been living since 2006, their son Eric told AFP.

Bacos was flying from Tel Aviv to Paris on June 27, 1976, when Palestinian and German radicals hijacked the aircraft, which was flown to Entebbe in Uganda.

The former French Resistance fighter earned France’s highest award, the Legion d’Honneur, for refusing to leave the plane and ordering his crew to remain with Jewish passengers who were separated from non-Jews.

“By courageously refusing to give into anti-Semitism and barbarism he honoured France,” Nice Mayor Christian Estrosi wrote in a tribute, hailing Bacos as “a hero” and sending condolences to his widow Rosemary and their three sons.

The hijackers boarded the flight during a stopover in Athens and demanded it change course.

After a refuelling stop in Moamer Kadhafi’s Libya, the plane headed to Uganda, then ruled by brutal dictator Idi Amin.

The hostages were freed after six days by Israeli commandos, who launched a raid that has since been re-told in multiple documentaries and films as one of the most audacious special-forces operations in history.

The commandos freed all but four of the 105 hostages, shooting dead all the kidnappers and several Ugandan troops in the process.

The only Israeli soldier killed in Operation Thunderbolt was Yonatan Netanyahu, the elder brother of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

– Gun to his neck –

In an interview with Israel’s Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper in 2016, Bacos said that as he flew the plane a German hijacker “sat behind me with his gun pointed at my head.

“Every time I tried to look in a different direction, he pressed the barrel of his gun against my neck.”

On arrival in Uganda, the hijackers separated passengers with Jewish names from the rest.

“I told the Palestinians and the Germans: ‘I’m responsible for all of the passengers and demand to be able to see all of them — be they Israeli or not — at any given moment.’ I insisted, and the Germans agreed.”

“As a former officer in the Free French Forces, I couldn’t imagine leaving behind not even a single passenger.”

Two weeks after the hijacking, Bacos was back at work and asked to fly to Israel “to see if I were still afraid.”

That flight, he said, “went without a hitch.”


MOUNT SODOM, ISRAEL (AP) — Israeli researchers said Thursday they have surveyed what they now believe to be the world’s longest salt cave, a network of twisting passageways at the southern tip of the Dead Sea.

A recently completed survey of the Malham Cave determined the labyrinthine cavern stretches more than 10 kilometers (6 miles) in length. That puts it well ahead of Iran’s Namakdan Cave, previously thought to be the longest salt cave.

The survey was conducted by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and a collection of Israeli, Bulgarian and international volunteers.

Boaz Langford, a researcher at the university’s Caves Research Center, and Antoniya Vlaykova, a Bulgarian cave explorer from the European Speleological Federation, headed the expedition.

“What’s unique about this cave, as opposed to other salt caves in the world, is that it’s the longest in the world,” Langford said, resting in a chamber of the cave dubbed the “Wedding Hall” for its salt stalactites.

Langford and Vlaykova said they plan to publish the complete map of the cave in a professional publication in the coming months.

There is no official record for the longest salt cave, and such designations are generally decided by consensus among cave researchers after an underground chamber is mapped and published.

Namakdan, which is about 6 kilometers (4 miles) in length, was identified as the longest salt cave after a study by Czech and Iranian scientists in 2006.

Salt caves are unusual and rare geological features. Because salt is highly water soluble, large salt deposits do not normally survive long on the surface. Only a handful of salt caves are larger than a kilometer (half a mile) in length. Salt caves tend to only exist in highly arid regions, like the area around the Dead Sea, which is located at the lowest point on earth and is too salty to support animal life.

The Dead Sea and Mount Sodom were formed by tectonic activity, the shifting of the Earth’s plates at the northern end of the 6,000-kilometer (4,000-mile) Afro-Arabian Rift Valley. Over millions of years, successive flooding of the deep depression lay down thick layers of salt.

“The salt layers are squeezed out from the sub-surface, where they are deposited a few kilometers underground, and while being squeezed out they form a mountain, which is rising still today, at a rate of about one centimeter per year,” said Amos Frumkin, a Hebrew University geologist who has studied the cave for decades.

The Malham Cave’s main outlet yawns not far from a salt pillar named “Lot’s wife,” after the biblical character who was petrified for looking back at the destruction of the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. On the mountainside above, Langford, Vlaykova and their colleagues have identified at least 19 openings where seasonal floods have percolated through Mount Sodom’s rock salt to form the cave.

Yoav Negev, founder of the Israeli Cave Explorers Club, said that over two years, his group and a total of 80 volunteers from nine countries spent around 1,500 workdays measuring and mapping the cavern’s recesses.

“It’s above and beyond what we expected,” he said.

Efraim Cohen, one of the Hebrew University cave explorers, described the process of locating the cave’s entrances from the surface, rappelling down into surface shafts, squeezing through tight passages, and measuring each of the cavern’s serpentine branches with lasers.

Despite the difficult environment, he said the cave’s splendor makes it worth it.

“All the stalagmites and stalactites, their beauty, their color — they’re really white, they’re shining, they’re amazing,” Cohen said.

Radiocarbon dating of wood fragments found inside the cave have helped date its formation to around 7,000 years ago, making it extremely young by speleological standards.

“The reason why it’s so young is because it’s made of salt,” Frumkin explained. “Limestone caves are much slower to form. They are usually much older. But this one is developing very fast so it’s one of the youngest caves in the world.”

Frumkin said that studying the cave’s formation has provided researchers with information about the climate of the region over the past 7,000 years, and how that has affected the emergence of civilization. Jericho, one of world’s first cities and an epicenter for the development of agriculture, is around 80 kilometers (50 miles) north of the Malham Cave.

“Because the salt is so soluble, that means that every change in the climate leaves its mark in the cave,” Frumkin said. “If there is more water, more rainfall, the cave is enlarged, and Dead Sea level changes, and this makes a huge difference in the morphology of the cave.”

Although the scientists have completed their study, there is still more of the cave that is undiscovered, he said.

“There are some more parts, especially upper levels, which have not been surveyed yet because they are difficult to reach,” Frumkin said.


Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights will not be recognized or sanctioned by the European Union (E.U.) , despite the U.S. policy reversal on the disputed territory.

The E.U. Foreign Affairs Department said in a statement Wednesday that it was the “unanimous position” of all 28 member states not to change their stance in line with U.N. resolutions that identify the Golan Heights as occupied territory and reject the seizure of land by force.

﻿

The move follows Monday’s signing by President Donald Trump of a proclamation recognizing Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights, reversing more than a half-century of U.S. policy.

Standing alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House, Trump made formal a move he announced in a tweet last week.

After 52 years it is time for the United States to fully recognize Israel’s Sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which is of critical strategic and security importance to the State of Israel and Regional Stability! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 21, 2019

The president said it was time for the U.S. to take the step after 52 years of Israeli control of the strategic highlands on the border with Syria.

Israel captured the Israeli sections of the Golan Heights from Syria as a result of the Six-Dar War and Israel annexed the territory in 1981.

Israel has maintained the territory longer than the brief 19 years that it was under Syrian control from 1948 to 1967. Before that, the Golan was controlled by the French and British mandates and by Turkey.

After the modern state of Israel was founded in 1948, tens of thousands of acres of land in the Golan Heights was seized from Jewish associations which had purchased the land in the late 19th century.

In recent years, Syria has been destabilized by the years-long civil war there and Iran managed to gain a significant foothold in the country.


Libyan military commander Khalifa Haftar, who has conquered well over half the country despite the international community formally recognizing an entirely different government as legitimate, was a guest of Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz in Riyadh on Wednesday. Details of their conversation are scarce, but Haftar’s first visit to Saudi Arabia seems like a significant event.

Saudi Arabia’s state-run SPA press agency reported that the king “affirmed Saudi Arabia’s desire to promote Libya’s security and stability and its wish to see the Libyan people enjoy progress and prosperity.”

Salman and Haftar “reviewed the latest developments in the Libyan arena,” but few further details of the discussion were offered. Haftar shares the Saudis’ disdain for Qatar, the Muslim Brotherhood, and Turkey, so he and the king had plenty to talk about.

AFP noted the Arab League is scheduled to hold a summit next week at which Libya will be a top agenda item. The United Nations is also seeking to put together a Libya conference in April, its latest attempt to reconcile competing (and sometimes openly warring) factions and set up orderly national elections. An election tentatively scheduled for the end of 2018 did not happen, but Haftar is reportedly amenable to holding one in 2019.

A large delegation of European Union (EU) ambassadors met with Haftar in Benghazi on Tuesday to emphasize EU support for the U.N. peace plan and urge him to participate. The EU delegation expressed concerns about human rights violations across the country, although it appears to have come up short of directly accusing Haftar of perpetrating any of them.

The EU prefers to think of the past seven years of bloody chaos in Libya as a “transitional phase” that will soon end with a stable nationwide government. At this point, nearly every outside party seems to be making peace with the idea that Haftar will be part of it. Haftar does not seem interested in making peace with the idea that he will not be running it.

The U.N.-backed government in Tripoli protested Haftar’s conquest of southern Libya in February, accusing him of using counter-terrorist activity as an excuse to grab key territory with his so-called “Libyan National Army (LNA)” and conduct an ethnic cleansing campaign against minorities opposed to his rule.

The Tripoli government, and for that matter its supporters at the United Nations, were reportedly stunned by the speed of Haftar’s advance through the south. Protesters in Tripoli are rallying against military dictatorship and expressing support for elected Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj while Haftar is moving troops into position for a final assault on Tripoli, a move the warlord will not rule out making if he doesn’t end up with the position of power he desires. Militia units in Tripoli are rumored to be ready to defect to Haftar if he moves against the city and offers them the right price.

Haftar enjoys significant support from eastern Libyans who see him as an effective leader and strong military commander who can enforce peace upon Libya’s warring tribes, gangs, and terrorist cells.

Haftar’s power play also enjoys support from powerful outside interests, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia’s allies in the United Arab Emirates, and Russia, which British analysts say has provided the Libyan strongman with hundreds of mercenaries plus munitions, tanks, and drones. The Russians anticipate a Haftar-led Libyan government will secure their access to deep-water Libyan ports and oil.

Haftar has also enjoyed crucial diplomatic, and even military, support from France to the dismay of its fellow U.N., EU, and NATO members. The French see Haftar and his LNA as an effective force against terrorist breeding grounds in post-Qaddafi Libya and are willing to overlook his rough edges if he can stabilize the country.

The Saudis, like the United Nations and other outside observers, might have invited Haftar to Riyadh to get a feel for exactly what he wants, what he’s prepared to do in order to get it, and what position short of national dictator he is prepared to settle for. The outlines of an arrangement in which he retains complete control of the military and holds a position comparable to the elected prime minister can be glimpsed.


WASHINGTON, DC — Antisemitic slurs by U.S. lawmakers are making the United States a weaker ally to Israel and damaging America’s credibility in Middle Eastern nations involved in efforts by President Donald Trump’s administration to achieve peace between the Jewish republic and Palestine, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told lawmakers.

In recent days, members from both parties, including House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel (D-NY), have blasted Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) for antisemitic slurs. However, the secretary did not name the Minnesota Democrat.

Pompeo did condemn antisemitic remarks by U.S. lawmakers as “abhorrent,” during a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing. Although Rep. Omar belongs to the panel, she was not present at the time that Pompeo made the remarks.

﻿﻿

Pompeo’s comments came in response to queries from Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI) who asked:

We’ve seen the rising level of anti-semitism across our country and even in our own government institutions. Several high-profile individuals have spouted off anti-Israel rhetoric that has had to be countered with condemnation resolutions by the House. The administration is currently attempting to craft a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians…do these statements damage our standing with Israel and make us a weaker ally? And Secondly, do these types of anti-semitic acts and rhetoric damage the United States’ credibility in the Middle East nations that will be involved in the final agreement?

The secretary of state responded:

I think the answer to both questions is yes and anti-semitic language is abhorrent regardless of the U.S. diplomatic outcome, but yes it makes it more difficult undoubtedly. …Language used by members of Congress matters. These countries all around the world are listening to you all they’re watching. They’re watching to see if this a whole of United States government process. They’re watching voices even if sometimes those voices are outliers. They don’t always know what to make of it.

Noting more Jews identify as Democrat, the mainstream media have been countering U.S. President Donald Trump’s assertions that antisemitism is growing among Democrat-elected officials and Jews are leaving the party.

President Trump’s senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner has been working on the administration’s Israel-Palestine peace plan.


The U.S. has sanctioned a “vast network” of 25 people and entities in Iran, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates, who they accuse of helping Iran exchange over one billion dollars to finance Iranian military operations across the Middle East.

The U.S. Treasury announced on Monday that it was blacklisting 25 individuals and entities, including front companies located in Iran, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), associated with Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the Ministry of Defence and Armed Forces Logistics (MODAFL).

The IRCG remains Iran’s most important powerful security organization and controls vast swathes of the Iranian economy and yields massive influence over the country’s political system.

“Today’s action exposes an extensive sanctions evasion network established by the Iranian regime, which it increasingly relies on as the United States’ maximum pressure campaign severely constricts the regime’s sources of revenue,” added the State Department in a statement.

The sanctions are designed to lock those responsible out of the global financial system by prohibiting both American citizens and businesses from dealing with them in any financial capacity.

“We are targeting a vast network of front companies and individuals located in Iran, Turkey, and the UAE to disrupt a scheme the Iranian regime has used to illicitly move more than a billion dollars in funds,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement. “The IRGC, MODAFL, and other malign actors in Iran continue to exploit the international financial system to evade sanctions, while the regime funds terrorism and other destabilizing activities across the region.”

Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Sigal Mandelker also explained that the sanctions prevented hostiles actors from evading the broader financial sanctions re-imposed by President Donald Trump after he axed Barack Obama’s nuclear agreement with the Iranian regime.

“This vast network is just the latest example of the Iranian regime’s use of deceptive practices to exploit the global financial system and divert resources to sanctioned entities,” he continued. “This once again exposes to the international community the dangerous risks of operating in an Iranian economy that is deliberately opaque.

TEL AVIV — Speaking in a radio interview, Aaron Klein, Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief, offered his analysis on the escalation from the Gaza Strip prompted by unprovoked rocket attacks on Israel.

Besides the general goal of attacking the Jewish state, Klein dissected Hamas’s other possible motivations for launching rockets toward central Israel. The rocket attacks come at the height of an Israeli election campaign and just days after Hamas violently cracked down on protests inside Gaza spotlighting the coastal enclaves faltering economy. Those demonstrations evidenced anti-Hamas undertones.

Klein was speaking Wednesday morning on the Joe Piscopo Show on New York’s AM 970 The Answer.

Listen to the full interview here (Klein’s segment begins at the 21:45 mark):

The Breitbart reporter stated:

Why is Hamas doing this? What are they trying to gain here? First, you look at what has been happening in the Gaza Strip over the course of the last few years. Remember that Israel evacuated Gaza unilaterally in 2005 in hopes of creating peace. Hamas took over. Hamas has not been very good at ruling Gaza and the Palestinian public is sort of growing sick of it. In fact actually there were protests – and I think this really spooked Hamas – protests against the Hamas terrorist government in Gaza over the last few weeks. Could this be Hamas understanding that the people are very angry in Gaza and (Hamas is) trying instead to channel that anger, as they sometimes do, toward Israel? Also I know that Hamas has been for over a year now orchestrating these riots along the Israel-Gaza border and Hamas has achieved nothing from this at all. So I think they need an achievement and they know that right now they have a window of about two weeks where they can fire rockets into Israel and, they believe at least, that the Israeli Prime Minister is going to be restrained because they know that he cannot afford or that it will be very difficult for him electorally to send ground troops into Gaza and maybe have casualties. So Hamas might be understanding that there is a small window to get away with something.

Klein reminded listeners that “when terrorists fire rockets from Gaza these are not laser-guided missiles hitting military targets which within itself would obviously not be legitimate. These are rockets fired indiscriminately into Israeli cities. Toward Tel Aviv. North of Tel Aviv. Toward the Israeli communities near Gaza.”

This week’s violence began on Monday morning when a Gaza terror rocket scored a direct hit on an Israeli home north of Tel Aviv wounding seven people, including three children. The attack prompted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to cut his trip to Washington short as the Israel Defense Forces carried out surgical strikes targeting Hamas facilities, deployed two additional brigades to the Gaza border area and called up reservists.

The IDF said that Hamas was behind the rocket fire. Monday’s attack came after two rockets were launched at Tel Aviv earlier this month , with Hamas officials claiming those projectiles were fired by mistake.

Tuesday saw a large volley of terror rockets plummet Israeli communities near Gaza as Israeli aircraft continued retaliatory surgical strikes against Hamas terror installations.

Wednesday has been mostly calm amid unconfirmed reports that an unofficial cease fire agreement was reached between Israel and Hamas via Egyptian mediation.


Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) is facing a torrent of criticism from the left after she met with California delegates to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) policy conference in Washington, DC, on Monday — after joining other Democratic presidential contenders in skipping the conference.

Last week, the left-wing MoveOn.org called on Democratic presidential candidates to boycott the conference, and congratulated Harris for doing so:

However, on Monday, Harris met with AIPAC delegates from he home state, who joined thousands of other activists on Capitol Hill this week in lobbying members of Congress to support a strong U.S.-Israel alliance.

Great to meet today in my office with California AIPAC leaders to discuss the need for a strong U.S.-Israel alliance, the right of Israel to defend itself, and my commitment to combat anti-Semitism in our country and around the world. pic.twitter.com/83Yrrbw4Q8 — Kamala Harris (@SenKamalaHarris) March 25, 2019

AIPAC tweeted its appreciation:

We are delighted that as part of AIPAC Policy Conference our leadership met with @SenKamalaHarris who reiterated her support for the importance of the U.S.-Israel relationship. #AIPAC2019 https://t.co/nqdrQymd4z — AIPAC (@AIPAC) March 25, 2019

But “progressives” who dislike Israel were outraged, and accused Harris of opportunism and hypocrisy:

lmao @ Kamala Harris, always riding the fence. Makes a big deal out of skipping AIPAC for the headlines, but then invites AIPAC to her office instead. We see through your faux progressivism, Kamala. https://t.co/zULTlo5I9R — cabral (@axcomrade) March 26, 2019

Kamala Harris: I will not be attending AIPAC this year… ✊ Progressives: Hell Yeah Sister!!! ✊ Also Kamala Harris: Because AIPAC is coming to my office instead. Also Progressives: Dammit, not again, why do I vote Blue no matter who ‍♂️ pic.twitter.com/P26XcUjLYi — Kenneth Mejia (@kennethmejiaLA) March 26, 2019

Sneaky @KamalaHarris, you agreed not to attend or speak at AIPAC But then you let AIPAC bring a meeting right to your office, exposing your real position as a defender of violence and apartheid Not okay and we will continue to call you out!https://t.co/OnDL6InoJD — Ariel Gold אריאל (@ArielElyseGold) March 26, 2019

Harris was, however, not the only Democratic presidential contender to meet with AIPAC representatives privately this week. According to journalist Ron Kampeas of the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, others did as well:

.@aipac official tells me Senators Booker, Harris, Gillibrand, Klobuchar all met with AIPAC constituent delegations this year #Oycott — (((Ron Kampeas))) (@kampeas) March 27, 2019

AIPAC was the target of antisemitic remarks by Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) last month, when she claimed — falsely, that AIPAC bribes members of Congress to support Israel.

President Donald Trump is attempting to seize the pro-Israel mantle from Democrats. Earlier this week, he recognized Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Last year, he signed legislation to deny U.S. taxpayer funds to the Palestinian Authority as long as it continued to pay terrorists and their families. He also withdrew the U.S. from the Iran deal, and visited the Western Wall in Jerusalem, the first sitting U.S. president to do so. And he moved the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, fulfilling a promise of both Republican and Democratic presidents.

Not one elected Democrat attended the embassy opening.

Massive floods in Iran killed at least two dozen people and injured hundreds more, local officials have confirmed, an event that the country’s energy minister blamed on climate change.

Dramatic footage posted across social media shows muddy water surging through the city of Shiraz where a majority of the lives were lost. The floods have reportedly affected 28 out of 31 provinces, including the capital of Tehran, wreaking havoc across the country.

As noted by state outlet PressTV, the “deluge has inflicted heavy losses on a number of agricultural and farming industries, as well as tribal stock-raising units,” and has also “inundated many businesses and warehouses, and damaged or destroyed a large number of residential units in disaster areas.”

According to the country’s health ministry, at least 110 people were injured as a result of the flooding, while over 25,000 had to be put up in emergency accommodation. Iran’s energy minister, Reza Ardakanian, blamed the events on climate change.

“Climate change is forcing itself on our country,” he said. “These floods in Iran are the result of climate change worldwide.”

Meanwhile, Iran’s crisis management committee sent out multiple text messages to all mobiles in Iran on Wednesday urging people to remain cautious and await instructions from authorities.

“Remain calm when facing possible dangers… do not honk your car horns in mountainous regions as it might cause avalanches,” one of the messages read. “Do not set up tents near rivers or mountainous areas… and most importantly do not cross bridges when floods are running underneath.

Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued a message of condolence on Wednesday, urging officials to accelerate relief efforts and compensation for victims. However, many people have criticized the government’s ineffective response to the situation, with many relief workers absent because of the national holiday, an issue the Iranian judiciary has pledged to investigate.

“Any shortcomings regarding the handling of the floods, failure to provide relief and aid to the survivors will be investigated,” said judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi.


Pope Francis sent a telegram to the people of Iran Wednesday, offering condolences for the casualties and destruction caused by extreme flooding in the country.

“His Holiness Pope Francis was saddened to learn of the loss of life, injury and damage caused by floods afflicting various regions of Iran, and he has asked me to convey his heartfelt solidarity with all affected,” read the telegram, signed on the pope’s behalf by Vatican secretary of state Cardinal Pietro Parolin.

Torrential rain and floods across most of Iran this week has resulted in the death of 23 people with scores more injured. In the worst-hit city of Shiraz, the inundation took the lives of 19 people Tuesday, leaving another 98 injured.

Wednesday’s telegram said that Pope Francis “commends the souls of the deceased to the love of the Merciful One, and invokes divine blessings of consolation and strength on those who grieve.”

“Praying for the emergency personnel and all the efforts to provide relief, he entrusts the people of Iran to the providence of the Almighty,” it read.

Iran’s energy minister has blamed the calamity, which hit in the midst of Iranian New Year holidays, on “climate change.”

The pope has begun sending regular telegrams to those who suffer from extreme weather events and has expressed his conviction that the frequency of these events is caused by climate change, which, he claims, should be apparent to all.

In an address to young people in Rome Tuesday, Francis said that a dangerous ego-centrism easily mutates into “a refusal to be challenged by the evident destruction of creation!”

“This is a disgrace!” he said.

The pope has said that humanity is experiencing a “climate emergency” and that skepticism regarding the dangers of human-induced climate change is a “perverse” attitude that imperils the world.

“We need a conversation that unites us all, because the environmental challenge we are experiencing, and its human roots, affects us all,” Francis said in late 2017.

Four “perverse” attitudes that obstruct the quest for concrete solutions to the problem of climate change “range from denial of the problem to indifference, nonchalant resignation, or blind trust in technical solutions,” he said.

TEL AVIV – The IDF poked fun at Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh, urging him not to forget to update the Israeli military as to the location of his new headquarters after an IAF strike saw the terror leader’s current offices leveled.

“When you arrive at the location that used to be your headquarters, look right, look left,” Avichay Adraee, who is in charge of the IDF’s Arabic-language social media, teased on Tuesday following the raid on Haniyeh’s office the previous evening.

“Is it right to endanger the lives of the residents of the Gaza Strip?” Adraee wrote.

“Don’t forget to let us know where your new office is,” he quipped.

The IDF on Tuesday continued its bombing campaign in the Gaza Strip, taking out dozens of terror targets including Hamas weapons manufacturing sites, military posts, and missile launch sites in the southern Gaza cities of Khan Younis and Rafah.

According to the IDF, the strikes were in response to earlier rockets fired into southern Israel as well as the launching of incendiary devices over the border and a breach of the Gaza security fence by a group of Palestinians who then set fire to an unmanned Israeli sniper’s post.

The flareup was the result of a rocket attack on Monday that leveled a private home in central Israel, injuring seven people, including three children.

The rocket caused the building to catch fire, burning the structure to the ground.

The J-80 rocket, which has a range of 120 km (75 miles), was the third long-range rocket fired from Gaza in two weeks and traveled the longest distance of any Gaza-launched rocket since 2014’s summer conflict.


(UPI) — A Dutch art investigator announced Tuesday he found a Pablo Picasso (pictured) painting stolen off a Saudi sheikh’s yacht in 1999.

The discovery came four years after Arthur Brand first began looking for the cubist artwork painted in 1938. The painting, Portrait of Dora Maar, was reported stolen by Saudi billionaire Sheikh Abdul Mohsen in 1999.

“Everyone assumed it had been destroyed — that’s what happens with 90 percent of all stolen art, because it can’t be put on sale,” Brand told Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant in an article translated by BBC News.

Brand said two people with connections in the underground art world contacted him about the painting earlier this month. They said it was in the Netherlands.

“They told me, ‘It’s in the hands of a businessman who got it as payment, and he doesn’t know what to do with it,'” Brand told the New York Times. “I talked to the two guys and we made a plan to get it out of his hands.”

The contacts brought the painting in two garbage bags to Brand’s residence, where they toasted to the painting’s discovery before leaving. Brand said he then hung the painting on his wall.

“The urge was too great; I couldn’t resist,” he said.

Brand said a Picasso expert from New York’s Pace Gallery authenticated the painting before he handed it over to retired British detective Dick Ellis, who founded Scotland Yard’s art and antiquities investigative unit. The painting has since been given to an insurance company.

Brand said his contacts said a businessman in the Netherlands received the painting as a form of payment and he wasn’t sure what to do with it. French and Dutch police said they don’t intend to prosecute the businessman.

Dora Maar, born Theodora Markovitch, was a photographer who was in a relationship with Picasso from 1936 to 1943. She died at the age of 89 in 1997.


Stoning to death for gay sex and amputation for theft are just two provisions in new legislation planned for the tiny, oil-rich Asian state of Brunei that have drawn criticism from human rights groups.

The penalties, which also apply to children, are outlined in new sections under Brunei’s Sharia Penal Code and will begin on April 3. The legal changes were announced in a discreet notice on the attorney general’s website, AP reports.

Amnesty International on Wednesday slammed the new legislation, saying it was “cruel” and “inhuman”.

“To legalize such cruel and inhuman penalties is appalling of itself,” said Rachel Chhoa-Howard, Brunei researcher at Amnesty International. She said some of the potential offenses “should not even be deemed crimes at all, including consensual sex between adults of the same gender.”

“Brunei must immediately halt its plans to implement these vicious punishments and revise its penal code in compliance with its human rights obligations,” Chhoa-Howard said. “The international community must urgently condemn Brunei’s move to put these cruel penalties into practice.”

The latest move in the strict imposition of strict Islamic law in Brunei was first flagged back in 2014 when the Sultan, Hassanal Bolkiah, announced the first phase of Sharia. “With faith and gratitude to Allah the almighty, I declare that tomorrow, Thursday 1 May 2014, will see the enforcement of sharia law phase one, to be followed by the other phases,” the monarch decreed.

The first phase introduced fines and jail terms for offences such as indecent behaviour, failure to attend Friday prayers, and falling pregnant outside of wedlock. The next phase, covering crimes such as theft, will involve punishments such as severing limbs and flogging, has now officially been implemented.

Brunei is one of the most developed nations in East Asia, deriving much of its wealth from oil. Its healthcare, education system and public services are heavily subsidised, yet it retains an absolute monarchy with no sign of democratic reform for the foreseeable future.

The small state is situated on the island of Borneo, which it shares with Malaysia and Indonesia.

Although the new Sharia code is believed to be popular among the Muslim ethnic Malays who make up 70 percent of the country’s population, the laws will also apply to non-Muslims. Around one-third of Brunei’s residents are non-Muslim, including substantial Buddhist and Christian communities.

Amnesty labeled the Sharia amendment as a “deeply flawed piece of legislation” with a range of provisions that violate human rights.

There has been no vocal opposition to the law in Brunei, where Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah rules as head of state with full executive authority. Public criticism of his policies is extremely rare.

The Sultan, who has reigned since 1967, has previously said the Shariah Penal Code should be regarded as a form of “special guidance” from God and would be “part of the great history” of Brunei.

Under secular laws, Brunei already prescribes caning as a penalty for crimes including immigration offenses, for which convicts can be flogged with a rattan cane.

In 2015 the Sultan banned the celebration of Christmas in any form, warning residents of his country that if they plan on celebrating the Christian festival, they could face up to five years in jail.

SYDNEY (AP) — Australia’s top cyberwarrior revealed Wednesday that his country actively participated in the electronic war against the Islamic State group in Syria, degrading their communications during military operations and actively stopping people seeking to join the extremist group.

The director-general of the government-run Australian Signals Directorate, Mike Burgess, spoke publicly for the first time about his agency’s work.

Burgess cited an example of how the cyberwarfare body helped the Australian Defense Force and its allies win a critical battle with IS.

“Just as the coalition forces were preparing to attack the terrorists’ position, our offensive cyberoperators were at their keyboards in Australia — firing highly targeted bits and bytes into cyberspace,” Burgess said in a speech at the Lowy Institute, an Australian strategic think tank.

He said IS communications “were degraded within seconds.”

“Terrorist commanders couldn’t connect to the internet and were unable to communicate with each other. The terrorists were in disarray and driven from their position — in part because of the young men and women at their keyboards some 11,000 kilometers (6,900 miles) or so from the battle.”

Burgess said the operation required weeks of planning by his agency and military personnel and was unprecedented in terms of how cyberwarfare was closely synchronized with the movements of military personnel.

“And it was highly successful. Without reliable communications, the enemy had no means to organize themselves. And the coalition forces regained the territory,” Burgess said.

He said his agency had also inflicted important damage to IS’s “media machine” by locking it out of its servers and destroying propaganda material, undermining its ability to “spread hate and recruit new members.”

In a rare departure — anywhere in the world — from the secrecy that typically surrounds such operations, Burgess painted a fuller picture of his agency’s work in a speech aimed at recruiting more operatives.

“Our targets may find their communications don’t work at a critical moment — rather than being destroyed completely. Or they don’t work in the way they are expecting. Or they might find themselves not able to access their information or accounts precisely when they need to,” he said.

Operatives came from all walks of life, having studied anything from mathematics to biology and marketing, he said. They sat at computers in Canberra, where they worked against IS on battlefields in Syria.

He said another operation began after his agency learned of a man “in a remote location” who had been radicalized and was attempting to join a terrorist group. A team was assembled, including linguistic, cultural and behavioral experts, which was headed by a young female science graduate in Canberra who was pretending to be a senior male terrorist in the Middle East.

“ASD tracked down and reached out to the man over the internet. Pretending to be a terrorist commander, our lead operator used a series of online conversations to gradually win her target’s trust,” Burgess said.

“To ensure he couldn’t be contacted by the real terrorists, she got him to change his modes and methods of communication. Eventually, she convinced the aspiring terrorist to abandon his plan for jihad and move to another country where our partner agencies could ensure he was no longer a danger to others or himself,” he said.

Burgess said the woman who led the operation was like many “from fairly ordinary backgrounds” who worked to help Australian operations abroad, or to prevent cyberattacks targeted at Australia.

“And when she was studying science at university, she would never have dreamed that one day she would be posing online as a terrorist and helping to defend Australia from global threats,” he said.


Hamas terrorist leader Ismail Haniyeh had his administrative offices destroyed early Tuesday morning after an estimated 80 Israeli air strikes leveled dozens of terror installations in the territory.

Israel struck dozens of Hamas targets, including the office of leader Ismail Haniyeh. A three-story building serving as Hamas’ “secret headquarters” was also struck in an air raid (see main picture above), the IDF said.

Three Palestinians were wounded in the strikes and evacuated to al-Shifa hospital, the Palestinian WAFA news wire reported.

The Israeli strikes were in response to a rocket attack earlier that day that leveled a home in central Israel, injuring seven people, including three children.

The rocket caused the building to catch fire, burning the structure to the ground.

Pictures below reveal the devastation of Israel’s response:

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu flew back from the U.S. during the night of the attack, heading straight to IDF headquarters in Tel Aviv to supervise the response to Hamas’ aggression the day before.

An unofficial cease-fire appeared to be holding Wednesday between Israel and Gaza’s Hamas rulers despite limited exchanges of fire, AP reports.


Syria’s state-run media published photos of citizens marching in the streets on Tuesday to protest U.S. President Donald Trump’s proclamation recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. The Syrian regime’s patrons in Iran denounced the decision, while the increasingly Islamist government of Turkey vowed to fight the U.S. and Israel at the United Nations.

According to Syrian media, large demonstrations took place in several cities on Tuesday morning. The demonstrators waved Syrian and Palestinian flags and carried banners proclaiming, “Golan is Syrian.”

An official with the Syrian Foreign Ministry described the American proclamation as “a blatant attack on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Syrian Arab Republic and a disregard for all international reactions denouncing this decision.”

The Syrian official denounced the United States as “the main enemy of the Arabs” and said Trump’s support for Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights is a “disgraceful slap to the international community.”

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Tuesday described Trump’s action as an imperialist outrage “unprecedented in the current century.”

“No one could imagine that a person in America comes and gives the land of a nation to another occupying country, against international laws and conventions,” Rouhani said.

Saudi Arabia and the Sunni states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) joined Iran and estranged GCC member Qatar in objecting to President Trump’s proclamation, albeit in less histrionic terms. The Saudi state news agency predicted the Golan declaration “will have significant negative effects on the peace process in the Middle East and the security and stability of the region.”

Jordan, generally a reliable U.S. ally but interested in restoring relations with the Assad regime in Syria, also refused on Monday to recognize the Golan Heights as Israeli territory.

The most heated denunciations of the Golan proclamation arguably came from Turkey, whose President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is angling for a position as champion of the Islamic world. Turkey has long disliked the Assad regime in Syria, but Turkish officials seemed angrier on Monday and Tuesday than their Syrian counterparts over the disposition of the Golan Heights.

“Attempts by the U.S. to legitimize Israel’s actions against international law will only lead to more violence and pain in the region,” Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu predicted.

Cavusoglu declared Turkish support for Syria’s “territorial integrity,” presumably with the exception of whatever Syrian soil Turkish forces must roll across on their way to attacking the Syrian Kurds.

Turkey’s authoritarian President Recep Tayyip Erdogan vowed over the weekend to challenge the U.S. and Israel at the United Nations.

“The U.N. has the final verdict on this,” Erdogan said. “It is not possible for the U.N. General Assembly to approve the issue.”

Erdogan and Cavusoglu both contemptuously dismissed Trump’s signature on the Golan proclamation as a pre-election gift to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

“Trump wants to present the Golan Heights to Netanyahu as a present on a gold platter,” Erdogan said.


Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) attacked Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) on Tuesday after the latter criticized the anti-Israel “boycott, divestment, sanctions” (BDS) movement in a speech to a pro-Israel group in Washington, DC.

Pelosi told the annual policy conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC): “We must also be vigilant against bigoted or dangerous ideologies masquerading as policy, and that includes BDS.”

She also attacked antisemitism and those who questioned the “loyalty or patriotism” of those who support Israel, a reference to remarks by Omar and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) — though she did not mention either by name.

Omar supports BDS — despite telling voters in Minnesota’s congressional district during her election campaign that she did not. The left-wing Forward reported that Omar’s shift was “a bait-and-switch to many Jewish Minnesotans.”

Despite Omar’s position on BDS, and her history of anti-Israel and antisemitic remarks, Pelosi appointed her to the House Foreign Affairs Committee in January. When Omar accused that supporters of Israel owe “allegiance to a foreign country,” Pelosi protected Omar by passing a resolution that condemned all forms of hatred but did not focus on antisemitism or single out Omar by name. She later defended Omar as not “intentionally antisemitic.”

Nevertheless, Omar criticized Pelosi on Tuesday for attacking BDS, as quoted by The Hill: “A condemnation for people that want to exercise their First Amendment rights is beneath any leader, and I hope that we find a better use of language when we are trying to speak as members of Congress that are sworn to protect the Constitution.”

Omar was referring to an argument made by BDS activists, who claim anti-BDS legislation punishes free speech and association.

Federal law already discourages participation in international boycotts of Israel. Most new anti-BDS laws, which have been adopted by dozens of states, prevent state governments from doing business with companies that boycott Israel.

One federal court found that a Kansas anti-BDS law violated the First Amendment when applied to a public employee; another upheld an Arkansas anti-BDS law, ruling that the law did not implicate free speech rights.

VERONA — Alt-left demonstrators descended on the Italian city of Verona Saturday to protest the World Congress of Families, sending the city into a security lockdown.

Riot police and army soldiers in camouflage gear set up roadblocks in various points around Verona’s massive Piazza Bra and its adjoining tributaries, site of the congress and epicenter of the radical feminist and LGBT protests.

The 13th annual World Congress of Families, which featured speakers and participants from around the world to discuss the importance of stable families for the future of civilization, met with surprising opposition, which erupted in Saturday’s demonstrations:

Event organizers decried the rampant fake news surrounding the event, which painted participants as neo-fascists, homophobes, and misogynists (despite the fact that more than half of the speakers were women).

“From reading the press, one would think the congress were all about condemning homosexuality,” lamented Brian Brown, president of the International Organization for the Family, “when, in fact, homosexuality is not even among the topics discussed.”

In his address at the congress, Italy’s Interior Minister Matteo Salvini drew applause when he said that the coverage of the event made him ashamed to be a journalist, the politician’s former career.

“There is no resemblance between what the journalists are saying and what is really going on here,” he said. “I am sad to see this sort of hypocrisy and political correctness reigning among journalists. The evening news will fabricate what they want, but we know the truth”:

Told he was “courageous” for coming to speak at the congress, Mr. Salvini said we are living in strange times if speaking at a family congress requires courage.

“George Orwell should be obligatory reading in our schools because we are witnessing everything he predicted,” Salvini said. “Newspeak, ministry of truth, thought police. This is what we are living. The groupthink is terrifying.”

“Somebody needs to tell the journalists that this is 2019. They need to get with the times. There are no fascists here,” Mr. Salvini said.

Salvini also noted that it is “not normal” to need protection from riot police to speak about something as uncontroversial as the nuclear family.

“Who can be bothered by the words ‘Mom’ and ‘Dad’?” Salvini asked. “And if they are bothered, the problem is with them, not with the words.”

“There is no parent 1 and parent 2,” he added. “There is a mother and a father, and there are children.”

“Having a child is the most beautiful choice a person can make,” he said. “A country without children is a country without a future.”

The media-creators of the Russia Collusion Hoax now bring you the Mueller Report Cover Up Hoax!

Yes, America is divided politically, but for just a moment can I get a collective groan of Not this shit again.

Deep State Cuck HQ: “The Mueller report is more than 300 pages long. We’ve seen 101 words.”

Russia Hoax Central Command: “Mueller Report Exceeds 300 Pages, Raising Questions About Four-Page Summary”

Russia Hoaxstress Queen: “[T]he Mueller report is over 300 pages long, that doesn’t tell us anything about what’s in it, but it does raise further questions about why thus far we’re only allowed to see less than 50 words[.]”

Someone Who’s Never Heard of a Book Report: “How on earth was Barr able to digest and summarize a 300+ page report in less than 48 hours?”

I could go on and on…

Let’s begin with the beguine…

First off, it was the Russia Hoaxsters at the New York Times who reported on the 300 page length of the Mueller Report.

The New York Times, y’all.

So after two years of the New York Times lying to us about our president being a Russia spy, what say we all just take everything they report now as gospel.

Please.

Secondly, assuming the Times report is true… so what?

I once got a C+ for summarizing a 175 page Hardy Boys mystery — The Missing Chums — down to less than a page. It was my first year of college.

But here we go again…

HERE.

WE.

GO.

AGAIN.

The Russia Hoaxsters got a whole new Russia Hoax, and this one is just as stupid and desperate as the last one, so please allow me to count the ways…

Why would Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the Poindexter who originally sicced Special Counsel Robert Mueller on Trump, the Dirty Cop who told Trump to fire FBI Director James Comey and then used the firing as his excuse to appoint a Special Counsel, sign off on the four page summary if it was bullshit?

Why would Attorney General Bill Barr release a four page summary to cover up all the terrible things that are really in the report knowing 1) he would someday release the full report and 2) the report is eventually going to leak?

And here’s my favorite…

Special Counsel Robert Mueller dropped a bomb on BuzzFeed after that hack outfit published fake news, so does anyone honestly believe Mueller would remain quiet if Barr’s four page summary was in any way misleading?

Would Mueller’s gang of assistant prosecutors and investigators, almost all of whom donated to Hillary Clinton’s campaign, remain silent if the four page summary was a cover up?

Hey, make no mistake, I want the Mueller Report released, or at least as much of it as possible. Obviously national security concerns have to be respected and I do not want any information or innuendo released against someone who was not charged with a crime, and that includes the president. This is still America where prosecutors are not supposed to download on the innocent.

But we are going to see the Mueller Report. We are. And the Russia Hoaxsters at the far-left CNN and the far-left Washington Post and the far-left New York Times and the far-left NBC know we are going to see it.

But here they all are ginning up a new hoax, a new conspiracy theory, and in the case of Max Boot, a conspiracy theory so goddamned stupid I can only close with this:

Friday on Hugh Hewitt’s nationally syndicated radio show, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) said he foresees problems ahead for the media in the wake of the conclusion of the special counsel Robert Mueller’s findings that the 2016 Trump campaign did not collude with the Russian government to defeat Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.

Hawley described the situation as the media having been “shown up to the greatest extent” of his lifetime.

“I do think that you’ve seen a massive sea change here. I mean, they, and nobody, Hugh, you talk about the resistance,” he said. “Of course, it’s not just elected Democrats. I mean, the resistance has its real home in the liberal media. And the media has been shown up to the greatest extent in my lifetime. I’m 39 years old this year. I mean, to the greatest extent of my lifetime, they have been shown to be horrifically partisan, to have perpetrated and perpetuated a series of falsehoods, and in many cases, to have done it knowingly all because they hate this president. They disagree with him politically, and they’d do anything to take him down.”

“And so I think they’re going to face a major crisis of confidence, which they deserve,” Hawley continued. “And the Democrat Party is facing a major crisis of identity now, and policy, which they deserve. And it’s incumbent on us, and the President, by the way, said this when he visited the Republican senators this past week. He said now it’s our time to push forward, to continue to push forward, and to lead this country, to show the American people what we’re for. He’s exactly right. And that’s why I’m extremely optimistic about the next two years, and the next four after that.”

In the wake of the journalistic catastrophe exposed by the Mueller report, it is important that we record as many of the lies that we can and shine a bright light on the most dishonest goats in the media over the past two years.

No publications deserve more contempt and ridicule than The New York Times and The Washington Post. Both were once serious newspapers dedicated to ferreting out the truth and holding accountable those in power.

Sure, they have always suffered from metropolitan biases, but they also always aimed for the truth. They were nobody’s stooges — at least openly. No more. Both newspapers are now entirely dedicated to blindly advancing a crazy political agenda and, we now know, are more than willing to lie and shade to push their twisted information on readers.

In today’s world of fire hose information from every direction, the greatest human superpower is the ability to filter out all the dishonest streams of misinformation coming from all the dirty outlets that have lost all credibility.

I will never read another story about even baseball in The Washington Post ever again — now that I know just how fully committed they are to distorting every little thing.

The New York Times is an even greater disappointment considering the gold standard stature the Gray Lady once held in the constellation of American newspapers.

In February 2017, NYT published a story headlined, “Trump Campaign Aides Had Repeated Contacts with Russian Intelligence,” by Michael S. Schmidt, Mark Mazzetti and Matt Apuzzo. The story cited “phone records and intercepted calls” and relied upon “four current and former American officials.”

The only problem: the story was “almost entirely wrong,” according to none other than ousted-FBI Director James B. Comey. Testifying before Congress, Mr. Comey said he was so alarmed by the outlandish claims in the story that he checked with the intelligence community. After confirming it was a bogus report, Comey notified congressional leaders to disregard the report.

While The New York Times appended a correction to a photo caption that ran with the fake story and appended another minor numerical correction, the newspaper never retracted nor corrected the fake news story as a whole.

Even worse, The Times submitted the story for one of the most prestigious journalism awards in America — and won!

The George Polk Award committee bestowed the highly coveted Polk Award on both The New York Times and The Washington Post.

“Special recognition goes out this year to the staffs of The New York Times and The Washington Post for their extraordinary effort in uncovering the connection between the Trump presidential campaign and the Kremlin that led to Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s ongoing investigation,” the judges wrote.

“The Polk judges felt the investigative work, based on the cultivation of sources, was equally outstanding on the part of both newspapers and may play a significant role in safeguarding our democracy from foreign interference.”

Truly, “Democracy Dies in Darkness,” as the sniveling Washington Post likes to preach every day.

The list of trusted, reliable sources in this post-Mueller world has shrunk to a small handful.

Two of journalism’s biggest goats from the past two years are David Corn of Mother Jones magazine and Michael Isikoff of Yahoo! News website.

To be fair, David Corn is not and never has been a reporter. He has always been a crazy partisan activist that nobody really takes all that seriously.

Michael Isikoff, on the other hand, worked at Newsweek magazine, a once-respected if left-leaning newsweekly. Mr. Isikoff is most famous for getting scooped by internet sleuth Matt Drudge on his own story about Monica Lewinsky.

No two people have done more than these two buffoons to peddle fantasy claims, unfounded conspiracy theories and outright lies regarding President Trump’s supposed collusion with the Kremlin during the 2016 election.

The two of them actually co-authored a book — and I am not making this up — titled “Russian Roulette.” The book regurgitated and expanded upon the largely debunked but lurid details from the “Steele Dossier,” which mostly turned out to be Kremlin-fed misinformation campaign funded by Democrats and the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign.

The funny thing here is that they named their book “Russian Roulette,” which is entirely fitting considering who wound up getting their heads blown off in the whole misadventure.

Democrats showed their support for embattled House Intelligence Committee Chair Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) on Thursday by launching a hashtag, “#IStandWith Schiff,” as he stood by his allegations of Russian collusion.

For more than two years, Schiff claimed that he had seen evidence that President Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign had colluded with the Russian government. But Special Counsel Robert Mueller could not establish that was true, according to a summary of his report presented to Congress on Sunday by Attorney General William Barr. But Schiff has refused to back off his previous claims.

Republicans on the committee unanimously demanded Schiff’s resignation in a joint letter Thursday: “Your willingness to continue to promote a demonstrably false narrative is alarming. … As such, we have no faith in your ability to discharge your duties in a manner consistent with your Constitutional responsibility and urge your immediate resignation as Chairman of this Committee.”

But Schiff was defiant, refusing to resign and listing a series of facts that, in his view, established that collusion had, in fact, occurred.

At a press briefing, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi defended Schiff, saying that Barr had erred by offering his interpretation of Mueller’s report (even though he had quoted Mueller directly) and demanding the full document be released. Later, on Twitter, she tweeted a video of her remarks, with the hashtag “#IStandWithSchiff.”

Other Democrats joined in, sending the hashtag to the list of Twitter “trending” topics in the United States:

Despite advice from House Majority Whip James Clyburn (D-SC) to let the collusion issue go, Democrats are clearly sticking with it.

For the record, the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) is taking great satisfaction from the train wreck in Montgomery, Alabama.

Since the March 14 firing of the Southern Poverty Law Center’s (SPLC) founder, Morris Dees, over unspecified allegations of misconduct , numerous current and former staffers have gone public with charges of institutional racism, sexual harassment in the workplace, and unethical fundraising tactics. Dees’ firing was quickly followed by the resignation of the group’s long-time president, Richard Cohen, who allowed such practices to persist under his command.

Like the temperance crusader being caught with a flask of moonshine in her garter belt, it is hard not to engage in a bit of schadenfreude over the revelation that the self-appointed watchdog over who is moral enough to express a political opinion in the public square is itself rotten to the core and has also fleeced well-meaning contributors out of hundreds of millions of dollars.

But enough about the SPLC. They were never really the problem. It was their enablers who should be hiding their heads in shame – most notably, the countless “objective” news organizations that unquestioningly parroted the SPLC’s “hate group” labeling of FAIR and other organizations merely because they effectively advocated political positions that editors and reporters didn’t like.

These news organizations were not duped by the SPLC (as though having the wool pulled over their eyes for several decades would not be a damning indictment of their competence). They were co-conspirators in the SPLC’s assault on free speech and complicit in the toxification of political discourse in contemporary America. The media knew that the SPLC had no credibility and that numerous mainstream groups were on the SPLC’s “hate group” list for no other reason than to silence opposing viewpoints and raise money for what disgruntled employees in Montgomery labeled the “Poverty Palace.”

The media knew the SPLC was a sham because the media reported it themselves. Even before the dam burst on March 14, a simple Google search would have turned up dozens of articles, written by respected journalists, reporting some or all of the accusations that have been confirmed since Dees’ firing. These articles have appeared not only in right-leaning publications (almost all of the SPLC’s targets are right of center), but even in left-leaning (and even far left ) publications and those that purport to have no ideological bias at all.

The common thread in all of these exposés was that the SPLC maliciously applied the “hate group” label in an effort to discredit organizations espousing political positions they didn’t like; that the SPLC has been riddled with internal racism ; and that the SPLC was capitalizing on its smear campaigns to accumulate more than a half a billion dollars in assets, while spending very little of it to advocate on behalf of the impoverished folks they claim to represent.

Yet, in spite of this multitude of evidence that the SPLC has not been an honest arbiter of moral fitness for political participation, many news organizations continued to append the “designated as a hate group by the SPLC” epithet when reporting on organizations tried and convicted in some Star Chamber deep in the bowels of the Poverty Palace in Montgomery.

Citing third party allegations impugning the characters of individuals or organizations may satisfy the legal requirements for news outlets to avoid being sued for slander, but it is not journalism. It is at best stenography and at worst a transparent effort to express bias while claiming objectivity. It is also a large contributing factor to the deterioration of political civility bemoaned by the very news outlets that have allowed the SPLC to serve as their proxy to attack advocates for political views they oppose.

We all know hate speech when we hear it. We actually don’t need self-appointed watchdogs – even ones not as morally tainted as the SPLC – to tell us whose views are worthy of consideration and whose are not. Societies are at their healthiest when people are provided accurate information and allowed to draw their own conclusions.

Maybe the SPLC can reform itself and get back to its original noble mission of fighting for justice for those who otherwise cannot afford the high cost of justice. But the very public fall of the SPLC reveals that they had some very powerful enablers in the media who are also in need of some serious introspection.


Some Democrats and mainstream media outlets appear to be embracing “collusion Truther” conspiracy theories.

These hold that despite Attorney General William Barr’s announcement on Sunday that Special Counsel Robert Mueller had not established that President Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign had colluded with Russia, proof of collusion still exists.

There are several variants of this collusion theory, which are not mutually exclusive.

The Pelosi version: Mueller’s report could prove collusion, without Barr’s “spin” on its contents. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) told reporters on Thursday that Congress needed to see the full Mueller report without the attorney general’s interpretation of its findings, which she called “arrogant” and “condescending.” The implication is that the full report contains evidence of collusion — never mind the fact that Barr quoted Mueller directly and that Mueller has not said anything in public to dispute the attorney general’s summary of his findings. The New York Times version: Barr was incompetent. The Times published a story Thursday suggesting that Barr went too far in his four-page summary — and at the same time suggesting that he could not possibly have summed up a 300-page (or 700-page) report in just 48 hours. The summary “raises questions about what Mr. Barr might have left out of the four dense pages he sent Congress,” the Times reported. This theory is superficially to Pelosi’s version, except it implies that Barr’s omissions may have been due to incompetence, as well as political bias. The Dick Durbin version: Mueller was incompetent. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) complained on Monday: “‘It looks like Lester Holt [of NBC News] got more information than Mueller did about obstruction of justice.” Durbin, like Pelosi, also suggested Mueller’s conclusions were distorted by Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. The Adam Schiff version: We don’t actually need the Mueller report to know there was collusion. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) argued at the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday — after Republicans on the committee unanimously demanded his resignation as chairman — that regardless of what Mueller found, there was enough evidence of collusion already in the public domain to justify the accusation. He made a similar claim on CNN Wednesday, saying there was “ample evidence of collusion in plain sight.” He did not explain how that “ample evidence” would have failed to convince Mueller that Trump had actually colluded with the Russian government.

Earlier in the week, House Majority Whip James Clyburn (D-SC) urged his party to move on to other issues, such as health care: “”I believe that the Mueller report has been done. It’s a chapter that’s closed,” he told CNN. Yet for many Democrats — and some journalists — the temptation of the Russia collusion theory is too strong to let go.

A fierce mass brawl, reportedly between 50 men of mostly Turkish and Afghan backgrounds was caught on camera at a train station in the town of Rastatt.

The incident occurred on Saturday evening at around 6 pm and saw the two factions attack each other at the train station armed with several weapons including metal poles, Badische Neueste Nachrichten reports.

Local police said that the dispute between the two groups has been ongoing for a while and that the previous day a group of young Turkish men had beaten a group of Afghan migrants with fists and bats.

Investigators say that when officers arrived on the scene, only four Afghans had stayed behind, three of them injured but none chose to pursue any formal charges against their attackers.

The Saturday brawl saw two individuals injured and one of the perpetrators was alleged to have been carrying some kind of firearm.

What caused the problems between the two groups remains unclear, police say. A spokesman said that those questioned were “more reluctant with information” and that the issue was still being investigated.

WATCH: More Than 50 Armed Migrants Go On Rampage in German City https://t.co/vwRu77Jr5w — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 1, 2018

The mass brawl is just the latest involving groups of migrants in Germany, some of which have been caught on camera.

In August last year, a brawl involving around 50 men from Kurdish, Turkish, and Lebanese backgrounds was caught on video in the city of Duisberg.

While police said that between 20 to 30 had taken part in the skirmish on each side, other sources suggested the number had been even higher at 80 individuals or more.

In March 2017, another brawl took place in the town of Peine in Lower Saxony which saw a group of Syrian and Palestinian migrants clash with each other.

Later that same night more violence erupted on the streets of the town with 40 to 50 locals leaving their homes to confront the violent mob who then turned on them shouting “Allah hu Akbar.”


The Washington Post faces boycotts over two “transphobic” cartoons drawn by a conservative illustrator which were recently published by the newspaper.

The cartoons, drawn by conservative syndicated illustrator Mike Lester, were criticized by hundreds of Twitter users, including ACLU attorney Chase Strangio.

One of the comics featured a row of men cheering at a scantily clad woman bursting out of a cake captioned, “The Mueller Report,” with two waiters commenting, “Wait till they find out that’s a dude,” while the other comic mocked transgender athletes being able to participate with biological women and dominating the competition.

“It’s obvious what Lester is implying: The Mueller report is as disappointing and deceptive as trans women who seduce cisgender men. If only we wore our transness on our sleeve, we could protect cis people from ever having sex with us,” the Daily Dot claimed. “It’s not just bigoted; its punchline is so transphobic that the comic only makes sense to readers who also think trans women are secretly men in drag.”

Dave Zirin, a sports editor at the Nation, responded to the cartoon by declaring, “Fails as a joke. Succeeds as bigotry. What a combo!”

Some users even claimed to have canceled their subscriptions to the Washington Post over the cartoons, and others threatened to do so.

“hey I’m a @washingtonpost subscriber, but not for much longer if they keep publishing gross transphobic hate. I wrote as much to the customer care team, hope you’ll do the same cuz this is not acceptable,” complained one user, while another proclaimed, “i don’t give money to people who hurt this community, so today i cancelled my subscription.”

“I just canceled my subscription. I don’t want my money to pay for corny ass transphobic cartoons like the ones done by @MikeLester,” declared an English subscriber.

In a statement to Gay Star News, a spokesman for the Washington Post stated, “We give cartoonists wide latitude in what they present… While we may not agree with some perspectives, cartoons serve a role in generating conversation and debate.”

Gene Park, an editor at the Washington Post, also responded to the criticism on Reddit, replying, “Thanks to everyone for sounding off on this offensive piece… Mike Lester is not technically an employee of ours, although we do run and administer The Washington Post Writers Group, a group of syndicated outside (and inside) columnists and editorial cartoonists.”

“We do NOT run Mike Lester’s cartoons in The Washington Post, and this one in particular was not published anywhere in our pages,” Park continued. “We employ two full-time cartoonists, Ann Telnaes and Tom Toles.”


CNN’s Brian Stelter blames CNN’s two-week ratings collapse on the fact “there hasn’t been much news” since Sunday’s release of the Mueller Report findings.

“It’s true that Fox’s prime time ratings have popped this week while CNN and MSNBC’s ratings have been below average. That makes sense: On the right, the Barr letter is being celebrated like a sequel to election night. Since the letter’s release on Sunday, there hasn’t been much news,” Stelter chirped in his nightly newsletter. [emphasis original]

He added that he is “not surprised by the ebb and flow” and reassured everyone that “I’m keeping an eye on it.”

Not much news, y’all.

Jeff Zucker’s ventriloquist dummy says there’s not much news.

You see, when the far-left CNN is only able to average 600,000 viewers throughout the day (while Fox averages 2.04 million and MSNBC averages 1.07 million), the only possible explanation is that “there hasn’t been much news.”

For two years CNN has been tub-thumpin’ the Russia Collusion Hoax, but the completion of that investigation, the vindication of the president of the United States, the removal of a two-year cloud over the presidency, the asterisk removed from the legitimacy of 2016 election, the fact that a sitting president has been cleared of treason allegations after a multi-year investigation that consumed the news-cycle day after day… is not news.

You know what else isn’t news to CNN…?

The bombshell news that Empire star Jussie Smollett had 16 felony counts magically dropped by a corrupt State’s Attorney because he is Empire star Jussie Smollett. What had been an all-consuming celebrity scandal is now a full-blown nuclear explosion with a political fallout that reaches all the way to former President Obama.

You know what else isn’t news to CNN…?

The arrest of Michael Avenatti — a character of the network’s own making — with federal charges in New York and Los Angeles.

You know what else isn’t news to CNN…?

The nuclear fallout from the Mueller Report, the frame job, the conspiracy, the collusion at the highest levels of the Obama White House, the Obama Department of Justice, the Obama F.B.I., the establishment media, and the intelligence community to remove a sitting president with lies.

You know what else isn’t news to CNN…?

The 2020 presidential election, which is already underway and competitive on the Democrat side.

You know what else isn’t news to CNN…?

An unprecedented surge of migrants desperate to become illegal aliens overwhelming our southern border.

Democrats voting down their own Green New Deal?

Not news.

Brexit drama?

Nope.

The fact that this is a historical turning point in Trump’s already historic presidency?

Still no?

How about CNN blacklisting Alan Dershowitz? Is that news, Baghdad Brian?

And then there’s my favorite bit of news, my favorite Fact-Apple of the last few weeks… CNN’s rating collapse began more than two weeks ago, long before the release of the Mueller report findings.

CNN lost nearly 30 percent of its primetime audience during the week of March 18 and 31 percent of its primetime audience during the week prior.

The slide is real, and as of Tuesday CNN’s primetime lineup reached only 798,000 viewers, while its total day average reached only 600,00.

CNN is dying. That’s not only news, it’s wonderful news.

Documentary filmmaker Mike Cernovich joined Breitbart News editor-in-chief Alex Marlow on Breitbart News Daily today, where he discussed Hoaxed, his feature documentary exposing bias and deliberate falsehoods pushed by the mainstream media, as well as his efforts to unseal court records in the Jeffrey Epstein case.

“The fake news media [hates] social media and want to crack down” said Cernovich.

“They just did a Russia hoax for two years. Jussie Smollett — God knows what is even going on in that case, but the media doesn’t seem to want to know why charges were just dismissed, and the records and everything were destroyed.” Cernovich added, “There’s a new hoax every day it seems.”

Marlow and Cernovich also discussed how the mainstream media holds the right, including non-journalists, to standards far higher than what they hold themselves to.

“Here’s a great example,” said Cernovich. “Mehdi Hasan, who’s big at Al Jazeera — which is owned by Qatar — and [who’s] now a CNN golden child … He goes around [saying] everybody’s a bigot, everybody’s a homophobe … This guy’s said some really bad stuff, way worse than Tucker Carlson, way worse than anything conservative media personalities say.”

Footage recently surfaced of Hasan, who regularly appears on mainstream media channels, comparing non-Muslims to animals, atheists to “cattle,” and gays to sexual deviants and pedophiles.

“The media’s not going to bring that up every time they talk about him” explained Cernovich. “They’re not going to say ‘Mehdi Hasan, comma, who works for a Qatari propaganda outlet and also compared people to animals, comma, said the following…'”

“They’ll just treat him as a straight-laced journalist, and pretend as if all of this stuff that he’s said, the fact that he works for state-owned media is not relevant at all.”

“That’s one of the nefarious ways in which the media shapes the narrative all the time” explained Cernovich. “If you’re a conservative, they’ll say ‘Alex Marlow, comma, who said something 10 years ago that offended someone, comma…’ before they bring in the point, but then on the left you have some really, really bad stuff that gets completely ignored. And of course, Media Matters isn’t trying to organize a boycott after those videos surfaced.”

Marlow and Cernovich also discussed Cernovich’s efforts to unseal court records in the case of billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, an associate of Bill Clinton and other high-level political and business figures.

“Why did this thing go away so quickly?” asked Marlow. “It seemed like this is a potential massive pedophile ring involving extremely powerful individuals, and it seemed to go away in fairly short order. Do you have a sense of why that would be?”

“I think the same reason that there are over 400 sealed congressional sexual harassment settlements paid with taxpayer dollars and the media doesn’t really seem to want to unseal those. It’s probably Democrats being implicated. The media will protect Democrats for anything.”

“When Democrats are doing bad things, as Harvey Weinstein did for decades and everybody knew about it, the media looks the other way.”

Cernovich recently announced the upcoming release of Blood Money, his new documentary about the influence of Qatari money and Qatari lobbying in American politics.

The New York Times appeared to lend credence Thursday to the fervent belief among some Democrats that Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report might actually contain evidence that President Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign colluded with the Russian government, printing a story about how critics were “raising questions” about Attorney General William Barr’s ability to summarize a length investigative report in four pages in just 48 hours.

In an article titled, “Mueller Report Exceeds 300 Pages, Raising Questions About Four-Page Summary,” the Times reported that Barr’s summary was both too long and not inclusive enough (original link):

The total of 300-plus pages suggests that Mr. Mueller went well beyond the kind of bare-bones summary required by the Justice Department regulation governing his appointment and detailed his conclusions at length. And it raises questions about what Mr. Barr might have left out of the four dense pages he sent Congress.

In addition, the Times noted the discrepancy between claims about the length of Mueller’s report:

Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, added the description ‘very substantial’ after talking to Mr. Barr on Wednesday, although neither he nor any other member of Congress has seen it and he declined to give a page count. Andrew Napolitano, a legal analyst for Fox News and a favorite of Mr. Trump, caused a stir on Wednesday when he said multiple times on the air that the report was 700 pages.

Despite Democrats’ suspicions (and hopes), Mueller has not disputed Barr’s summary, which quoted the report directly: “[T]he investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.”

In the past, Mueller’s office had occasionally spoken out against incorrect reporting, when that reporting seemed to mis-state fundamental facts about the investigation and its implications for the presidency.

The Times helped lay the foundation of the Russia collusion theory in its early reporting on the Trump administration, running a front-page story on Inauguration Day in 2017 reporting that “wiretapped” conversations revealed potential links between Russian agents and Trump campaign associates.

President Donald Trump ridiculed the old media for experiencing plunging ratings after the release of the Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report that exonerated the president.

“Wow, ratings for ‘Morning Joe,’ which were really bad in the first place, just ‘tanked’ with the release of the Mueller Report,” Trump wrote. “Likewise, other shows on MSNBC and CNN have gone down by as much as 50 percent.”

MSNBC’s top host Rachel Maddow’s ratings plunged 19 percent from a year ago, CNN lost nearly 30 percent of their primetime audience, while Fox News ratings spiked.

Scarborough defended his network in an angry rant on Wednesday.

“A lot of you who were bitching and moaning last night and being morally self-righteous: you are the bad actor,” he said, attacking his critics. “So save your breath, all right? We’re not going to divert our eyes.”

But Trump appeared vindicated.

“Just shows, Fake News never wins!” he said.

Earlier Thursday, Trump said that the “Fake News Media” was suffering a “breakdown.”

“I have learned to live with Fake News, which has never been more corrupt than it is right now,” he said. “Someday, I will tell you the secret!”

The Fake News Media is going Crazy! They are suffering a major “breakdown,” have ZERO credibility or respect, & must be thinking about going legit. I have learned to live with Fake News, which has never been more corrupt than it is right now. Someday, I will tell you the secret! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 28, 2019


Avengers: Endgame star Chris Evans is making plans to launch a new political website along with Joe Kiani, an entrepreneur and mega-donor to former President Obama’s presidential campaign.

In a profile piece published in The Hollywood Reporter, Chris Evans, who campaigned for Hillary Clinton in 2016, talks politics and using his voice to speak out about issues he cares about. Among other things, the Disney star calls President Donald Trump a “dumb shit” and says that he’s willing to lose half his audience over his left-wing political views.

Perhaps the most interesting buried lede from the THR piece is the fact that he plans to start a political website called “A Starting Point,” which is, according to the Reporter, dedicated to creating “informed, responsible and empathetic citizens.”

The two co-founders for this website are even more interesting.

First, there is Joe Kiani, an entrepreneur in the medical field who’s also spent years cutting big checks to Democrats.

According to the campaign finance website Open Secrets, Kiani was a bundler for Barack Obama’s re-election efforts in 2012, directing a minimum of $500,000 to his campaign. In 2017, Kiani donated another whopping amount to the Obama Foundation. According to the Chicago Tribune, he gave “in the range of $500,000 to $750,000.”

Kiani has connections to the Clinton family as well. According to Clinton Foundation documents, Kiani paid over $100,000 for a meeting with Bill Clinton. As Breitbart News reported in 2016, Kiani paid $140,000 for a “Meeting with WJC” (William Jefferson Clinton).

The other co-founder, Hollywood actor and producer Mark Kassen, is a friend of Kiani’s.

Kiani serves on the board of Kassen’s production company, Like Minded Entertainment (LME). In 2017, THR reported that LME created a “360-degree and VR live stream of President Barack Obama’s final speech in office from Chicago, produced with VantageVR and VR Scout.”


Democrats would sooner “put communities in danger” than acknowledge the “emergency” and “crisis” of insecurity along the U.S.-Mexico border, Adam Kennedy, the White House deputy director of communications, told Breitbart News.

Kennedy joined Wednesday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Daily with host Alex Marlow.

LISTEN:

Kennedy said Democrats oppose President Donald Trump’s border security and immigration proposals because of partisan political calculations.

“As soon as you acknowledge that there’s a crisis [and] emergency on the border, you have to then acknowledge that the president is taking logical steps to to address it,” said Kennedy. “And then you have to acknowledge that we should probably support his policies.

Democrats must deny the realities of southern border insecurity and illegal immigration, Kennedy continued, in order to justify their political obstinance.

“So as you soon as you accept the basis of it, the foundation of the argument, you go right down the road to supporting the president’s policies,” assessed Kennedy, “And the Democrats would rather, frankly, put communities in danger than do that.”

Kennedy added, “They refuse to back the president, even on policies they once supported. Again, barriers, a wall, this is not controversial when Democrats voted for it five years ago. It wasn’t controversial when they voted for it ten years ago, and ten years before that. It’s only controversial now that the president supports it.”

Kennedy mocked CNN President Jeff Zucker’s praise of his network’s conduct, particularly its handling of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s operation.

Zucker told the New York Times, “We are not investigators. We are journalists, and our role is to report the facts as we know them, which is exactly what we did.”

Kennedy remarked, “What’s so ironic about that is that they actually have a web page on CNN.com called CNN Investigates, so what are they doing on CNN Investigates? What are they doing on all their nightly broadcasts, if they’re not investigating anything?”

Harvard Law School professor emeritus and noted criminal defense attorney Alan Dershowitz alleges in an op-ed for The Hill that Jeff Zucker, president of CNN Worldwide, banned him from further appearances on the network because he defended President Donald Trump.

Dershowitz, while a liberal Democrat, and a supporter of Hillary Clinton in 2016, took the position that the president could not be charged with obstruction of justice based merely on an exercise of his constitutional duties. He was also critical of the investigation of Special Counsel Robert Mueller into claims of collusion between President Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and the Russian government.

Dershowitz wrote Thursday that after several appearances in which he had debated CNN’s hosts and legal analysts over the various legal questions surrounding the “Russia collusion” controversy, he was never invited back again:

Viewers enjoyed my feisty debates with legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin and asked for more. Host Anderson Cooper enjoyed sparring with me, as did hosts Chris Cuomo and Don Lemon. CNN viewers benefited from evaluating my viewpoints against those of other guests and hosts. But then, suddenly, I was banned from CNN. Over the past half year or so, I have never once been asked to appear on a CNN program. Initially I wondered why, and I asked some of my friends at the network. They were evasive and studiously avoided any direct answer to my question. Then I received off-the-record information that an order had come from the very top: CNN executive Jeff Zucker didn’t want me on CNN any more. My centrist, nuanced perspective was anathema to CNN’s emerging brand as the anti-Trump network.

Since Special Counsel Robert Mueller concluded that there was, after all, no collusion, Zucker has defended the network’s coverage of story, telling the New York Times: “We are not investigators. We are journalists, and our role is to report the facts as we know them, which is exactly what we did.”

The only people surprised that the special counsel’s investigation of Russian collusion did not confirm a lunatic conspiracy theory are consumers of the modern American media. For two years, our constitutionally protected guardians of the truth put out a stream of misinformation, promising viewers that Robert Mueller was going to reverse the outcome of the 2016 election.

Everyone at fake news MSNBC, marginally less fake news NBC, and totally fake news CNN — hosts, guests, legal experts and national security analysts — should be told, Clean out your lockers. Put all your things in cardboard cartons. If you need to go back, you will be escorted by security.

Instead, they are adamantly refusing to take back their years of lies about Trump and Russian collusion. This is not a time to let bygones by bygones. The boot should not be lifted from the media’s throat.

In case you’ve forgotten what needs to be taken back, here is a random selection, from a single network for simplicity:

“Hi Nicolle, and if it is Monday, the Russian conspiracy is so much worse than we knew … The Russian conspiracy to help get Donald Trump elected was apparently wider, deeper, dirtier, more sophisticated and more pervasive than we thought.”

— Katy Tur, MSNBC, Dec. 17, 2018

** ** **

“Well, this demonstrates that Robert Mueller is focusing on exactly what he is supposed to be focusing on, and that is Russia … We already have clear evidence of collaboration between the Trump campaign and Russian agents.”

— Richard Painter, lawyer, MSNBC, May 1, 2018

** ** **

“You see all of these Russian connections — there’s a new one every single day, and increasingly benign explanations for what the Trump, for what they’re up to, benign explanations are just not credible.”

— Max Boot, warmonger, MSNBC, July 21, 2017

** ** **

“We have the most immoral president perhaps in American history particularly because of the foreign influence of Russia … it is hard to believe that a prosecutor of Mueller’s testing and experience would come to the end of this and not have something to say about these terrible offenses.”

— John Flannery, lawyer, MSNBC, March 18, 2019

** ** **

“I’ll tell you something, if (Russia’s ‘inside man’ is) not George Papadopoulos, then we’ve got a mystery person inside the Trump campaign who theoretically could still be in place.”

— Frank Figliuzzi, former assistant director for counterintelligence, FBI, MSNBC, Jan. 9, 2018

** ** **

“I believe that what we have here is a very broad-based criminal conspiracy. … And Donald Trump is a walking example of how any intelligence officer can turn someone against their own nation. As John Brennan said, most of the time, they don’t even know that they’re committing treason.”

— Malcolm Nance, counterterrorism intel analyst, MSNBC, Nov. 30, 2018

** ** **

“This is the linkage between Donald Trump and Russia in crimes.”

— Jill Wine-Banks, assistant Watergate prosecutor, MSNBC, Dec. 7, 2018

“It’s going to be so clear that this has been a criminal enterprise from day one with the Russians and Trump …”

— Rep. Steve Cohen, MSNBC, Dec. 7, 2018

** ** **

“Were these gun rights folks potentially a conduit for Russian money alongside other forms of Russian government influence on our 2016 campaign?”

— Rachel Maddow, MSNBC, July 25, 2018

** ** **

“And what about Trump’s ringleadership of his people, including family members and their efforts to win this award of a foreign power, Russia, to win the presidency?”

— Chris Matthews, MSNBC, March 8, 2019

** ** **

“And the Russians’ investment in (Trump) goes back decades. … It may have been the situation where (Trump) decided, look, what Russia is giving us in terms of political help here and undermining Hillary Clinton’s candidacy may be way bigger than any deal we could ever get in Russia.”

— Natasha Bertrand, The Atlantic, MSNBC, Nov. 30, 2018

** ** **

“So, with this whole real estate deal and the claws that the Russians had into (Cohen), and what he was doing with that in terms of dealing with the Russians was all part and parcel of this conspiracy that resulted in their assistance in the campaign.”

— Nick Akerman, assistant Watergate prosecutor, MSNBC, Nov. 30, 2018

“An American president who has been compromised by the Russians faces the world.”

— Chris Hayes, MSNBC, Nov. 30, 2018


Hollywood actor Chris Evans is launching a political website he hopes will create more “empathic” Americans. The Marvel star is pepping this platform despite his own intolerance for the political views of others.

According to a new profile piece from The Hollywood Reporter, Chris Evans has been meeting with lawmakers and looking to leverage his voice as part of the “Resistance” to create a new political website called “A Starting Point.”

Evans campaigned for Hillary Clinton in 2016; and while he has not decided on his 2020 candidate, his crusading use of his platform has made him a real-life superhero to a certain segment of the online #Resistance. Days after we talk, he pops up on Capitol Hill to do some bipartisan grip-and-grins with Senate Democrats Brian Schatz, Chris Coons and Jeff Merkley and Republican Lisa Murkowski. In March, he does the same at the House of Representatives. It turns out he’s conducting interviews for A Starting Point, a politics website whose mission is “to create informed, responsible and empathetic citizens.” He’s a co-founder, along with the actor Mark Kassen and entrepreneur Joe Kiani; the launch date has yet to be announced.

The website, which markets itself as trying to make citizens more empathetic, is being launched as Evans publicly debates cutting off friends if they support President Donald Trump.

As Breitbart News previously reported, in the same THR piece, Evans said that if he learned New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady was a Trump supporter, he might have to end his friendship with the Super Bowl champion.

“I really hope he’s not a Trump supporter,” the 37-year-old said. “I’m just hoping he’s one of those guys that maybe supported him and now regrets it.”

“If he doesn’t, if he’s still on that Trump train, I might have to cut ties. It’s really tough,” the Avengers: Endgame star also said.

Evans is used the Reporter interview to call President Trump an “absolute dumb shit” and declare that he doesn’t care if he loses fans for attacking Trump.


High-profile lawyer Mark Geragos on Wednesday blasted CNN for terminating him from the network amid reports he is an unnamed co-conspirator in an alleged scheme by embattled lawyer Michael Avenatti to extort Nike.

“They ought to change their name to the ‘Cut and Run Network,’” Geragos scoffed during an appearance on the Adam Carolla Show, according to TheWrap. “I’ve been texted by all of their anchors who are as outraged as I am that after 20 years, a press conference is enough to have them immediately want to disassociate themselves.”

Geragos is not charged with a crime. However, according to the Wall Street Journal, he is the unidentified co-conspirator in court papers charging Avenatti, the former lawyer for porn star Stormy Daniels, with attempting to shake down Nike for $25 million by threatening the company with bad publicity. He has denied all wrongdoing and pledged to fight the charges.

“God forbid that I start telling some of the stories for how I’ve covered for that lame-ass organization,” Geragos told Carolla, before branding his former employer “the Know-Nothing Network.”

CNN swiftly terminated Geragos, who was a longtime legal analyst for the network, following reports of his alleged involvement in the scheme. His profile was quickly removed from the network’s website. CNN confirmed to TheWrap on Monday that Geragos is “no longer” a contributor but would not reveal the reason for his departure.

Asked by Carolla about his alleged involvement in the matter, Geragos said while he could not delve into the case, he felt “confident” he would be cleared.

Geragos represents Empire actor Jussie Smollett, who is alleged to have staged a hate crime against himself. Further, Geragos was the lead attorney in the grievance filed by former quarterback Colin Kaepernick against the NFL, in which the ex-49er accused the league of collusion by prohibiting him from re-entering the league as punishment for the anthem protests.


Conservative figures reacted with outrage earlier today as Twitter suspended the official account of Unplanned during the pro-life movie’s week of release. The account was restored shortly after its suspension, which Twitter said was related to the ban of a different account.

Unplanned, directed by Chuck Konzelman and Cary Solomon and starring Ashley Bratcher, tells the true-life story of Abby Johnson, a Planned Parenthood director who becomes a pro-life activist after witnessing a fetus struggling for life during an abortion at thirteen weeks gestation.

The film was released in U.S. theaters yesterday with a R-rating, which drew accusations of political bias against the MPAA, which assigns movie age ratings.

Twitter suspended Unplanned‘s official account, @UnplannedMovie earlier today. The social media platform has been widely criticized for alleged discrimination against conservatives, right-wingers.

Conservatives activists began lambasting Twitter for its decision shortly after the suspension. Lila Rose, director of the pro-life media movement Live Action also pointing out that the platform has banned her organization from running ads.

In a comment to Breitbart News, Twitter said that the suspension of Unplanned was an error related to the ban of a different account.

“It wasn’t directly about this account” said Twitter. “When an account violates the Twitter Rules, the system looks for linked accounts to mitigate things like ban evasion. In this case, on a second review, it was clear the account should not be affected by the other account’s suspension.”

Students at Dickinson College are taking issue with signs around campus that encourage students to take the stairs instead of elevators to improve their health. The students reportedly consider the signs “fat shaming,” as they promote the “dangerous narrative” that weight loss as “a positive thing.”

According to a report from the Dickinson College student newspaper, students were offended this month by a series of signs around campus that encourage students to avoid elevators. “Why not take the stairs if you are physically able?” the signs read. “Exercise and strengthen your heart and muscles.”

One student said that the signs made her feel guilty. She said that taking the stairs often caused her to feel dizzy. “I began to feel guilty every time that I took the elevator,” the student said. “I started realizing that I shouldn’t put my body through pain or stress when there is an elevator I could use,” she said.

Another student said that the signs were “fat shaming.” “These signs were effectively fat shaming as they promoted weight loss as a positive thing,” the student said. “It had a negative impact on campus to have a series of signs that glorified a dangerous narrative that feeds into eating disorders.”

Marni Jones, the dean and director of access and disability services at Dickinson College, said that the sign could be offensive to students who are forced to use elevators.

“Even with the qualifier “if you are physically able,” seeing a sign like this can feel shaming to those who have no choice but to use the elevator,” Jones said in a comment to the student newspaper. “I showed a picture of one of the posters to a student with a mobility impairment, who has difficulty using steps after having had four hip surgeries, to see what she thought about it, and she was visibly dejected upon reading it, saying, ‘That’s really unfair. You don’t know what other people are going through.’”

Stay tuned to Breitbart News for more updates on this story.


Harold Thomas Martin III entered a guilty plea at U.S. District Court in Baltimore on Thursday, admitting his role in what could be the worst breach of classified data in U.S. history.

The severity of the breach is measured in terms of how much information Martin looted from the systems he had access to. Fortunately, he does not appear to have done anything with the data he took. His defense lawyers characterized him as a data hoarder, a victim of compulsive mental illness who piled up classified files and sensitive documents the way other hoarders accumulate newspapers or clothes.

After Martin was arrested in 2016, there was speculation he might have been a “whistleblower” in the Edward Snowden mode who lost his nerve, or he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder after his deployment in Operation Desert Storm. Suspicions have been raised that he worked with or inspired the “Shadow Brokers,” an infamous hacker group that exposed some of the powerful software tools the National Security Agency (NSA) used for penetrating foreign computer systems.

As is perhaps inevitable with any case touching upon the shadowy world of cyber espionage, there are many theories about his alarming behavior and the curiously low-key processing of his case – which began with a huge FBI raid compared by eyewitnesses to a military invasion but has received little media attention since.

Martin wound up sitting on about 50 terabytes of data that never should have left the offices he took it from, a hoard prosecutors described as “breathtaking” in scope but rather sloppy in execution, as some of the pilfered material was reportedly stuffed into his car and an unlocked shed in his backyard. The NSA document he pled guilty to stealing is evidently one of the items he left in his car.

Martin stole about 300 times as much information as Snowden, including top-shelf secret spy software and information that could have compromised American agents on dangerous assignments. His data-hoarding career spanned two decades of work for government contractors, including the same one that employed Snowden, Booz Allen Hamilton.

Martin was originally charged with 20 counts of espionage but admitted to one count of “willful retention of national defense information,” for which the 54-year-old could serve up to nine years in prison. The two and a half years he has already been in custody will reportedly be credited against his sentence.


Facebook is changing its political advertising rules to ban parties and campaigns from advertising in countries where they do not have a representative.

“If they do not have a representative located in the country in which they want to advertise, they will not be able to do so,” explained Facebook executive Richard Allen, adding that advertisers would soon face “unprecedented levels of accountability.”

Allan declared, “We have guidance from experts to do everything we can to protect the integrity of the elections — recognising fully that this will cause inconvenience to parties that have been able to campaign before.”

Rob Leathern, Facebook’s Director of Product Management, also revealed that “identity documents” would be needed from political advertisers to confirm their location, and that advertisements “related to politics and issues on Facebook and Instagram in the EU” would be required to be labeled with a “paid by” notice.

The changes were criticized by left-wing politicians in the European Union, including Belgian MEP and Leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, Guy Verhofstadt, who claimed the changes contribute to the “killing the idea of European democracy.”

According to the Financial Times, critics like Verhofstadt allege that the changes “will harm them more than Russian troll factories.”

“It should be possible to stop shady interference from foreign countries without cutting off genuine pan-European debate,” complained German MEP and leader of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, Udo Bullmann. “As a staunch pro-European, we hoped Mr Clegg would understand this.”


Students and staff at the University of Minnesota have taken offense over the school’s decision to host film producer and alumnus Jim Burke as its 2019 commencement speaker, alleging that his film Green Book does not properly portray race issues. “It’s a feel-good, happy film that suggests, ‘Hey, racism is over in an era of [President] Donald Trump,” said one faculty member.

University of Minnesota alumnus Jim Burke is expected to speak at the school’s commencement ceremony on May 19, but some students and staff have been critical of the decision, as they feel that Burke’s Oscar-winning film Green Book does not adequately portray race issues, according to The Minnesota Daily.

Green Book, which won last month’s Oscar for “Best Picture,” is about an Italian-American bouncer from The Bronx, who is hired to be both the bodyguard and driver for a black pianist seeking to travel through the Deep South during the Jim Crow era, in which the decisions made by Democrat state and local legislatures dominated the region.

And despite their differences, the Italian-American bouncer, Frank Vallelonga, and the world-class pianist, Doctor Don Shirley, develop an unexpected friendship while dealing with racism together on their travels. Not everyone, however, is pleased with the film.

“It’s taking us back to a period in American racial history and racial conflict in the Civil Rights Movement that we kind of look back on and say, ‘Oh, we’ve come so far,'” said film studies coordinator Graeme Stout, “It’s always about white salvation.”

Stout added that he was not surprised to see the film win best picture, claiming that “it’s a feel-good, happy film that suggests, ‘Hey, racism is over in an era of [President] Donald Trump.”

Cultural Studies and Comparative Literature instructor Brad Stiffler echoed Stout’s sentiments, claiming that the film’s characters were set in the past as a tactic to make viewers believe that the United States has seen progress since the 1960’s with regards to race issues.

The instructor also expressed his frustration over how the film allegedly suggested that interpersonal relationships can be antidotes for racism, adding that he also takes issue with the way in which many films supposedly simplify racial problems by portraying them as individual prejudices that can be overcome.

“It’s something that this film especially seems to fall in that trap of reducing the complexity and the seriousness of race and race relations in the U.S. to this sort of caricatured idea of ‘can these two people be friends or not?'” said Stiffler.

Students have also expressed their displeasure with Burke’s film.

“Green Book is a white savior film,” said student Becca Mayo, “It allows and encourages a state of cognitive dissonance for white audiences between their perceived sense of self and racism.”

While the student takes note of Shirley seeking protection from Vallelonga in the film, she neglects to mention the mutual give and take between the two characters, and the many ways in which the Italian-American is helped by the black pianist, who employed Vallelonga while he was out of work, taught him how to carry himself with more finesse, and how to better communicate with his wife.

Another student, Kylee Mattson, had also taken issue with the producer being chosen as commencement speaker, but instead, expressed her concerns over another one of Burke’s films, entitled, The Descendants, as it had been set in Hawaii, but reportedly did not star any native Hawaiians.

“I hope [Burke] sees the diverse graduating class our school has and tries to incorporate that diversity into future movies,” said Mattson.

California legislators are preparing legislation in response to the college admissions bribe scandal that implicated several universities in the state.

California legislators are drafting a bill that would end legacy admissions at public colleges and universities. According to a press release from Democrat Assemblymember Phil Ting, the bill would prohibit “any California college or university from granting preferential admissions to applicants related to the institution’s donors or alumni, or risk exclusion from the Cal Grant program.”

Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath argued that the new bill would address and correct several flaws in the California public university system.

Here in California, we have created a world-class higher education system rooted in the idea that quality public education is one of the greatest equalizers in our society. The news over the past several days has shaken the public’s confidence in our system. Qualified students should have equal opportunity to access these institutions of higher learning, no matter where they’re from, or how much money their family makes. As a graduate of our UC system, I am proud to stand with Assemblymembers McCarty and Ting in working to identify and address the inherent flaws in our admissions process and restore faith in fair access for all California students.

Assemblyman Kevin McCarty, who is one of the legislators behind the proposed bill, said that the bribery scandal has undermined public trust in California’s public universities. “This scandal not only undermines the public trust in the college admissions process but it perpetuates the opportunity gap in our colleges across California,” McCarty said. “For every student admitted through bribery, there was an honest and talented student that was denied an opportunity to go to college,” he added.

The proposed bill would also end administration of the SAT & ACT tests for the purpose of public university admission. The bill’s sponsors will ask public university researchers to study the effectiveness of standardized tests.

Republican Congressman Phil Roe from Tennessee is fighting to end “free speech zones,” which restricts political activism to certain areas on college campuses.

According to a report from Campus Reform, Rep. Phil Roe (R-TN) is fighting to end unconstitutional restrictions on free speech at public colleges and universities around the country. Roe introduced House Resolution 191 aims to protect First Amendment rights on campus.

The text of the resolution highlights data from the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), which found that 40 percent of America’s top college have restrictive speech codes that prohibit constitutional speech.

Whereas despite the clarity of the applicable legal precedent and the vital importance of protecting our Nation’s public colleges as true “marketplaces of ideas,” the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education has found that roughly 1 in 10 of America’s top colleges and universities quarantine student expression to so-called “free speech zones,” that more than 20 speakers were disinvited from speaking on campuses in 2016, and a survey of 449 schools found that almost 40 percent maintain severely restrictive speech codes that clearly and substantially prohibit constitutionally protected speech.

Roe spoke with Campus Reform’s Cabot Phillips about his efforts to protect free expression on campus. Roe recalled the lively debate that took place in the 1960s when he was a college student. “We didn’t have social media, we didn’t have the Internet…but we had free debate that’s guaranteed under the First Amendment of the Constitution.”

Roe praised President Trump for his recent executive order, which also aims to protect free speech on campuses. “I think it will have teeth. I think having them have to prove that they’re not obstructing free speech to get a grant… I like that idea,” Roe said.

“We’ve had free speech for so long, we don’t know what it’s like to live without it,” Roe added.

USC has confirmed that Lori Loughlin’s daughters are still enrolled despite claims that they had decided to drop out.

According to a report from USA Today, Lori Loughlin’s two daughters are still enrolled at the University of Southern California. TMZ reported earlier this month that Loughlin’s daughters, who found themselves at the center of the DOJ’s college admissions investigation, planned to drop out over concerns about bullying.

“We have confirmed that both Olivia Giannulli and Isabella Giannulli still are enrolled. USC is conducting a case-by-case review for current students and graduates that may be connected to the scheme alleged by the government and will make informed decisions as those reviews are completed,” USC said in a statement.

Loughlin allegedly worked with William “Rick” Singer to create fake athletic profiles for her daughters. Loughlin and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, allegedly paid $500,000 to have their daughters admitted to the University of Southern California. As part of the scam, Loughlin allegedly snapped photos of her daughters on rowing equipment. Both girls were admitted to the University of Southern California as recruits for the crew team even though they had never rowed competitively.

USA Today also reported on Thursday that Loughlin’s daughter Olivia Jade, a popular social media influencer, failed to register a trademark for her beauty brand due to poor punctuation.



“Proper punctuation in identifications is necessary to delineate explicitly each product or service within a list and to avoid ambiguity,” the USPTO wrote in a letter on March 15. “Commas, semicolons, and apostrophes are the only punctuation that should be used.”

The USC student government held a meeting on Tuesday to consider three resolutions, one of which included calling on the university to make USC a “sanctuary campus” for illegal alien students, and to forbid the school’s Department of Public Safety from working with ICE.

The student government at USC held a meeting on Tuesday to discuss three resolutions, one of which would call on the university to become an official sanctuary campus, by adopting policies meant to protect illegal alien students, according to the school’s student newspaper,the Daily Trojan.

The first resolution, entitled, “Sanctuary University Resolution,” was proposed by student senator Michaela Murphy, and would demand that USC forbid its Department of Public Safety from working with ICE, as well as avoid collecting citizenship documents from students unless absolutely needed.

Murphy added that conversations and policies regarding the protection of illegal aliens cannot be informal. “It needs to be explicit, especially so that undocumented students and students with mixed immigrations[sic] status know for a fact, they know outright, that this university will protect them,” said the student senator.

The second resolution, titled, “VKC Flag Resolution,” was proposed by three members belonging to USC’s Students for Justice in Palestine student group, and would request for the university to increase the number of flags that hang in and around the Von KleinSmid Center Library (VKC), in order to better represent international students.

One of the resolution’s student authors, Yusuf Irshaad, said that he was inspired to write the VKC Flag Resolution partly due to the fact that there is no Palestinian flag among the 108 other flags that hang outside the library.

“When you go to VKC, you look around, there are open spaces that could definitely benefit from having those flags hung up,” said Irshaad, “There’s a lot of room to work with that.”

The third resolution, called, “Learning Experience Evaluations Resolution,” was proposed by student senator Jacquelyne Tan, which includes dissuading students from using the site “RateMyProfessors.com,” as the student senator believes it encompasses a “racial and gender bias.”

Tan wants to see USC students begin utilizing an alternative website.

“I want it to be a USC platform and [for it] to be moderated by qualified people,” said the student senator, “Some of the comments on ‘RateMyProfessors’ are extremely toxic and there is proven racial and gender bias.”

The three proposed resolutions will be voted on at a meeting next week, according to the student newspaper.

Students at the University of Notre Dame hosted “Leggings Day” on Tuesday in protest of a Catholic mother who wrote a letter to the editor suggesting that the young women have more respect for their own bodies, especially while attending Mass on campus.

One mother, Maryann White, was visiting the University of Notre Dame when she saw young women wearing what she described as “an unforgiving garment” while attending Mass at the Basilica. White wrote a letter to the editor on Monday, entitled, “The legging problem,” in which she criticized the students’ choice in attire and suggested that they have more respect for their bodies.

“The emergence of leggings as pants some years ago baffled me,” wrote the White, “I was at Mass at the Basilica — in front of us was a group of young women, all wearing very snug-fitting leggings and all wearing short-waisted tops (so that the lower body was uncovered except for the leggings). Some of them truly looked as though the leggings had been painted on them.”

The mother added that while women are free to wear what they want, they should also consider the impact that the fashion industry may have on them, and how it may cause young women “to voluntarily expose their nether regions in this way.”

“I was ashamed for the young women at Mass,” continued White in her letter, “I thought of all the other men around and behind us who couldn’t help but see their behinds.”

“I’ve heard women say that they like leggings because they’re ‘comfortable.’ So are pajamas. So is nakedness. And the human body is a beautiful thing. But we don’t go around naked because we respect ourselves — we want to be seen as a person, not a body,” said the concerned mother.

White concluded her letter by reminding young women that while they do “have every right to wear them,” that they also “have every right to choose not to.”

The mother’s letter then circulated on campus in the following days, sparking outrage among students, which promoted students to host protests calling on women to wear leggings on campus.

“Leggings Pride Day” was held on Tuesday, which was then followed by “The Leggings Protest” on Wednesday.

“So in this class, we actually had a whole discussion about it,” said student Kaitlyn Wong, who organized one of the protests, according to The Observer, “As an American Studies major, we talk a lot about changing this narrative that really marginalizes a lot of people, and everyone in my class was so upset about it.”

“I was just like, ‘Well, I can’t sit around and not do anything about it,’ so I created a Facebook event,” said the student.

“Maryann attacks women for living the way that they do, living casually in leggings,” added Wong, “I wanted to stir conversation about like why this is a problem — Even if it’s not a ‘protest,’ having people talk about it is better than sitting around and doing nothing.”

Another student, Tatiana Pernetti, expressed her concerns about having old-fashioned perspectives.

“It’s crazy to me that some people are still so stuck in the past,” said Pernetti, adding that while White may be entitled to her own opinion, “some people need to consider the root cause of their concerns more — especially societal norms — before putting the blame on individuals or an entire gender.”

“Keep going, keep pushing. Push for social activism, and if you think that something’s wrong, do something about it, say something about it, and have a conversation about it,” said Wong, “Anything you can do is better than sitting idly and accepting it.”

Lyft plans to make its public market debut on Friday. That could be good news for Democrats.

Lyft employees give almost exclusively to Democratic candidates, according to public records. And many of them will see their stakes in the company worth far more than previously estimated if the company shares sell at the valuation expected.

In the recent midterms, Lyft employees gave $60,150 to Democratic candidates and just $2,135 to Republicans, according to data from Open Secrets. The biggest beneficiary of Lyft political contributions was Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia. Representative Max Rose, the newly elected Congressman from New York’s 11th congressional district, which includes all of New York City’s borough of Staten Island and parts of southern Brooklyn, received $5,400, making him the second largest beneficiary.

Lyft’s political slant is not recent. In the 2016 election, Lyft employees gave a total of around $90,000 to political candidates–91 percent of which went to Democrats.

This kind of imbalanced giving is unusual in a public company, indicating that Lyft is drawing its employees from a narrow swathe of America. Drivers for Lyft are not considered employees in most areas. It is not so unusual in Silicon Valley, where Democrats are heavily favored by tech elites.


References to Minecraft creator Markus “Notch” Persson have been removed from the game after he expressed his belief that transgender women are not women this month.

As reported by Newsweek, earlier this month Persson responded to a Twitter post which claimed “trans women are women” by declaring, “No, they feel like they are.”

Persson also added, “you are absolutely evil if you want to encourage delusion. What happened to not stigmatizing mental illness?”

Persson’s comments made numerous news headlines from Newsweek to the Daily Dot, and Minecraft, the masively popular game which Persson created before selling it to Microsoft in 2014 for $2.5 billion, has now removed references to Persson’s alias Notch from the game.

According to Eurogamer, references to Notch have been removed “from the game’s main menu.”

“Messages such as ‘Made by Notch!’, ‘The Work of Notch!’ and ‘110813!’ — a nod to the date Notch got married — now no longer appear,” Eurogamer reported, adding, however, that he is “still listed as Minecraft’s creator in the game’s credits.”

Persson responded to the update in a Twitter post, writing, “My options here are to keep my name on a thing I’m proud of, or to get less tightly associated to one of my products, so it’s win-win.”

After being asked by a user what year he thought was the best for Minecraft, Persson also jokingly replied, “2019[…] Nah just kidding this year sucked for it. To worried fans: remember it’s yours, not theirs. You make your own adventures in there, and anywhere else you go.”


Dr. Robert Epstein found that Google “suppresses [and] depresses websites such as Breitbart News” in accordance with the company’s left-wing and partisan Democrat biases, offering his analysis on last Friday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight with host Rebecca Mansour and special guest host Rick Manning.

Epstein reflected on a research study he led examining people’s reactions to Internet search results.

“We measured bias in web pages and especially in the news sources that those web pages were on,” explained Epstein. “And, again, we wanted to see whether there was any liberal or conservative bias in search rankings of Google, Bing, and Yahoo.”

LISTEN:



Epstein continued, “We found substantial bias in Google’s search results, and if there was any bias at all in Bing and Yahoo, it was tilted towards the conservative side, but they can’t have much influence on an election because very few people use them. … Bing and Yahoo just can’t exert much influence, but Google sure can.”

Epstein added, “If they’re just giving people what they want to see and not doing anything else, then you should see conservative search results [if you are conservative]. But that’s not what actually happens. So they’re not just giving people what they want to see. They’re also trying to nudge people in a particular direction. That’s, of course, the direction of their own political preferences.”

“They’re sending everyone, pretty much everyone, results that are biased in a liberal direction,” stated Epstein. “And, by the way, we found this is all ten search positions of search results, which is the whole first page of Google search results, which covers everyone because hardly anyone goes beyond that first page.”

Google’s search results prioritize “liberal” news media outlets, explained Epstein.

“We looked at the news sources that these search results were taking you to, and the bias of news sources has been fairly precisely measured by several teams but most recently by this team at Harvard’s Berkman Klein Center,” Epstein said. “So we used those bias ratings, like New York Times rates extremely liberal, Breitbart rates more conservative, obviously, and we looked at bias from that perspective, and we found — again, looking at Google — they’re generally taking you to liberal news sources.”

Epstein went on to say, “So Breitbart doesn’t even appear in the top five news sources where they send people. With Bing and Yahoo, Breitbart is in the top five. There’s a little more variety [and] a little more balance, but Google seems to depress or suppress websites such as Breitbart News.”

Epstein noted Google’s power in driving — or reducing — Internet traffic to websites.

“Most major websites draw at least 25 — sometimes 30 percent or more — of their traffic from Google,” stated Epstein. “That’s true for the New York Times. It’s true for the Wall Street Journal, which, by way, has a much smaller level of traffic than Breitbart does. I looked it up.”

Epstein concluded, “But if you look up Breitbart, Breitbart gets only ten percent of its traffic from Google, which is extremely low. That’s very, very rare, and that implies suppression, and if you doubt that there’s suppression, just look at some of the leaks. Of course, there’s suppression, and you suppress in a way that’s going to meet your financial goals, of course — if you’re a for-profit company — but also in a way that’s going to meet your political goals. I mean, why not? Why wouldn’t you do that?”

Tech giant Facebook has reportedly been charged with housing discrimination by HUD based on ads that allegedly violate the Fair Housing Act. HUD Secretary Ben Carson said, “Facebook is discriminating against people based upon who they are and where they live.”

The Verge reports that HUD filed charges against Facebook recently for housing discrimination based on a complaint filed in August which alleges that Facebook has served ads violating the Fair Housing Act.

HUD Secretary Ben Carson said in a statement: “Facebook is discriminating against people based upon who they are and where they live. Using a computer to limit a person’s housing choices can be just as discriminatory as slamming a door in someone’s face.” HUD General Counsel Paul Compton added, “Even as we confront new technologies, the fair housing laws enacted over half a century ago remain clear—discrimination in housing-related advertising is against the law. Just because a process to deliver advertising is opaque and complex doesn’t mean that it exempts Facebook and others from our scrutiny and the law of the land. Fashioning appropriate remedies and the rules of the road for today’s technology as it impacts housing are a priority for HUD.”

The discrimination issue was first raised by ProPublica in 2016 when reporters at the outlet found that an advertising tool called “ethnic affinities” could be used to remove black or hispanic Facebook users from seeing certain ads in their newsfeed. If ads related to housing or employment opportunities used the ethnic affinities tool to exclude users of certain races, this could violate federal law. Facebook had no safeguards in place at the time to prevent this targeting.

Following ProPublica’s reporting, Facebook pledged to address the issue of discriminatory advertising but a followup report in 2017 found that many of the same problems were still an issue on the platform. The complaint from HUD claims that Facebook’s advertising options for excluding certain audiences in incredible direct and even includes a map tool that allows advertisers to prevent Facebook users from certain areas from seeing their ads.

“[Facebook] has provided a toggle button that enables advertisers to exclude men or women from seeing an ad, a search-box to exclude people who do not speak a specific language from seeing an ad, and a map tool to exclude people who live in a specified area from seeing an ad by drawing a red line around that area,” the complaint states.

A Facebook spokesperson told the Verge that the company is already working on these issues stating: “We’re surprised by HUD’s decision, as we’ve been working with them to address their concerns and have taken significant steps to prevent ads discrimination. Last year we eliminated thousands of targeting options that could potentially be misused, and just last week we reached historic agreements with the National Fair Housing Alliance, ACLU, and others.”

The spokesperson added: “Even as we confront new technologies, the fair housing laws enacted over half a century ago remain clear.” In August, Facebook removed 5,000 specific advertising targeting options from their platform stating: “While these options have been used in legitimate ways to reach people interested in a certain product or service, we think minimizing the risk of abuse is more important.”

The HUD complaint appears to take issue with the very nature of optimized advertising as well as possible discriminatory practice by Facebook advertisers, stating: “[Facebook]’s ad delivery system prevents advertisers who want to reach a broad audience of users from doing so. Even if an advertiser tries to target an audience that broadly spans protected class groups, [Facebook]’s ad delivery system will not show the ad to a diverse audience if the system considers users with particular characteristics most likely to engage with the ad.”

Facebook has claimed that discussions with HUD have broken down over disputes related to access to Facebook user data: “While we were eager to find a solution, HUD insisted on access to sensitive information — like user data — without adequate safeguards,” a Facebook spokesperson said. “We’re disappointed by today’s developments, but we’ll continue working with civil rights experts on these issues.”


Twitter is reportedly considering adding special labels to President Trump’s tweets if it decides they “violate” the site’s rules.

CNN reports that Twitter is considering adding labels to the President’s tweets that it judges to violate the site’s rules, indicating that the tweets were going to remain on the platform because they are considered to be in the public interest. During an interview with the Washington Post, Twitter’s head of legal, policy and trust, Vijaya Gadde, revealed the company’s plan.

Twitter is reportedly attempting to maintain the website’s standards while giving context to tweets from politicians and public figures which may violate the websites rules but add to public debate. Gadde was asked whether Twitter’s current approach to the president’s tweets means that he receives total immunity to say what he wishes on the platform. Gadde responded by saying that the platform wants to find a way to acknowledge that some tweets break the sites community standards but keep them on the platform if they are newsworthy.

“One of the things we’re working really closely on with our product and engineering folks is, ‘How can we label that?'” Gadde said, not specifically referring to President Trump. “How can we put some context around it so people are aware that that content is actually a violation of our rules and it is serving a particular purpose in remaining on the platform.”

Gadde believes that this approach would hold political leaders accountable for their tweets and note the site’s issues with the posts while still allowing the public to see them. The website does have a limit on speech that is allowed on the platform even from politicians and public figures, however. Some tweets would be considered a bannable offense according to Gadde: “An example would be a direct violent threat against an individual that we wouldn’t leave on the platform because of the danger it poses to that individual,” she said.

This isn’t always the case on Twitter. Jack Dorsey’s company allowed verified accounts to make calls for violence against conservative high school students during the Covington hate hoax, for example.

Gadde noted that Twitter is working on limiting the visibility of “dehumanizing” tweets on the platform, adding warnings before tweets that users have to click in order to read the tweet. Gadde stated that this would “force people to acknowledge what this is and make the choice of whether to see it or not versus it just being on the platform with full visibility.”


2020 Democratic Presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, who BuzzFeed notes is “the first openly gay presidential candidate from a major party,” criticized boycotters of Chick-fil-A for being “too sanctimonious,” and accused them of “virtue signaling.”

“I just want to make sure we don’t overrate ourselves in terms of our ability to be pure in this regard,” declared Buttigieg in an interview with BuzzFeed News, Wednesday. “If you’re turned off, as I am, by the political behavior of Chick-fil-A or their executives — if that leaves a bad taste in your mouth, so to speak, and you decide not to shop there, I’d certainly get it and I’d support that. But the reality is, we, I think, sometimes slip into a sort of virtue signaling in some cases where we’re not really being consistent. I mean, what about all the other places we get our chicken from?”

“I just want to make sure that we’re not too sanctimonious about this, because sometimes we put ourselves in this position of judgment that doesn’t really hold up under scrutiny,” he continued. “My belief is that we should primarily deal with political issues in the political arena.”

In another interview on the Breakfast Club, Tuesday, Buttigieg also proclaimed, “I do not approve of their politics… but I kind of approve of their chicken.”

Buttigieg, who is currently the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, announced his 2020 presidential campaign in January.

Chick-fil-A remains a hot button political issue. The city of San Antonio recently voted to block the company from opening a location in its airport. A city councilman proclaimed, “with this decision, the City Council reaffirmed the work our city has done to become a champion of equality and inclusion.”

Rider University also blocked Chick-fil-A from opening a restaurant on its campus, saying the company has “not sufficiently progressed enough.” As Breitbart News reported this month:

Cynthia Newman, the dean of Rider University’s College of Business, announced that she would be resigning from her post because of the administration’s decision to keep Chick-fil-A off campus. In a statement, Newman announced that the decision conflicted with her Christian beliefs. “As some of you already know, I am a committed follower of Jesus Christ,” Newman wrote in her statement. “As such, I endeavor every day to do exactly what Chick-fil-A puts forward as its overarching corporate value: to glorify God by being a faithful steward of all that is entrusted to me and to have a positive influence on all who come into contact with me.”

Breitbart News will continue to report on Chick-fil-A and its virtue signaling boycotters.


Security officials in the United Kingdom issued a report on Thursday identifying further security risks in equipment from Chinese telecom giant Huawei. The report noted Huawei has made no progress on addressing previously identified problems and said it would be “difficult” to manage the security risk from further Huawei purchases.

The U.K. Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Center (HCSEC), established by the company itself but overseen by British intelligence, issues a report on Huawei products every year. The new report arrives at a moment when the U.S. government is strongly encouraging allies to rethink purchases of Chinese electronics because they may include deliberate security vulnerabilities that could be exploited in the future by Chinese intelligence agencies.

The U.S. has warned allies such as Germany and Israel that intelligence sharing could be curtailed in the future if they rely on products from companies like Huawei. The British government’s final decision on whether to use Huawei products in its 5G wireless network is expected soon.

HCSEC’s 2019 report found “several hundred vulnerabilities and issues” with Huawei products, some of them unaddressed holdovers from the 2018 report. HCSEC noted that its evaluation team is “relatively small,” so the number of vulnerabilities they were able to discover with limited manpower is troubling.

“If an attacker has knowledge of these vulnerabilities and sufficient access to exploit them, they may be able to affect the operation of the network, in some cases causing it to cease operating correctly,” the British watchdog agency warned, mirroring concerns expressed by U.S. intelligence officials.

The warning was tempered by assurances that U.K. networks are configured in such a way that exploiting such vulnerabilities to attack secure government systems is difficult.

The U.K. experts thought the vulnerabilities they discovered could be “exploited by a range of actors,” but they did not believe the defects were a “result of Chinese state interference.”

HCSEC judged Huawei’s much-touted $2 billion plan to fix its security vulnerabilities over the next three to five years looks plausible on paper, but skeptically added that “similar strongly-worded commitments from Huawei in the past have not brought about any discernible improvements.” Some of those commitments date back to a cybersecurity white paper Huawei published in 2012.

“Huawei’s development and support processes are not currently conducive to long-term

security risk management and, at present, the Oversight Board has seen nothing to give confidence in Huawei’s capacity to fix this,” the report concluded.

The Verge noted on Thursday that one of the U.K.’s four big mobile operators, EE, long ago ruled out using Huawei equipment for core network functions. One of the others has placed Huawei purchases on hold while security issues are evaluated, while the other two are currently evaluating Huawei products on their own.

“We understand these concerns and take them very seriously,” a Huawei spokesperson said after the new HCSEC report was released.

“To ensure the ongoing security of global telecom networks, the industry, regulators, and governments need to work together on higher common standards for cybersecurity,” the spokesperson said, portraying the $2 billion security improvement plan promised by the company since last year as merely the “initial budget” for enhancements it plans to make.

TechCrunch described the new HCSEC report as a “withering assessment” and viewed it as a sign the U.K. might be considering a change in policy toward Huawei:

Critics of Huawei can now point to impatience rising in the U.K., despite comments by the head of the NCSC, Ciaran Martin, last month — who said then that security agencies believe the risk of using Huawei kit can be managed, suggesting the government won’t push for an outright ban. The report does not literally overturn that view but it does blast out a very loud and alarming warning about the difficulty for UK operators to “appropriately” risk-manage what’s branded defective and vulnerable Huawei kit. Including flagging the risk of future products — which the board suggests will be increasingly complex to manage. All of which could well just push operators to seek alternatives.

TechCruch observed that the U.K. government could simply order Huawei to address all of the major concerns spotlighted by the HCSEC, instead of accepting the company’s assurances that everything will be taken care of, but such a brute-force approach could compromise the performance and stability of the 5G network and make future upgrades difficult.

Politico called the new report a “bombshell” and predicted it could have ripple effects in other European countries with Huawei security centers. The report could make U.K. wireless companies more nervous about using Huawei products even if the government decides not to ban or restrict them.

“Several smaller countries have asked leading intelligence services like the U.K.’s for input. The European Commission earlier this week issued recommendations for EU countries to share their security assessments and come to a joint position on whether to allow Huawei into their networks,” Politico reported.


Google is reportedly carrying out a secret “performance review” of its censored Chinese search app, codenamed Project Dragonfly, despite the company claiming in December that is has no plans to launch the project. Project Dragonfly faced widespread condemnation including from members of Congress, human rights organizations, and hundreds of Google employees themselves.

According to the Intercept, executives at Google are “carrying out a secret internal assessment” of the project.

“A small group of top managers at the internet giant are conducting a ‘performance review’ of the controversial effort to build the search platform, known as Dragonfly, which was designed to blacklist information about human rights, democracy, religion, and peaceful protest,” the Intercept revealed. “Performance reviews at Google are undertaken annually to evaluate employees’ output and development.”

The Intercept also noted that while performance reviews at Google typically have a peer-review component, “In the case of Dragonfly,” the “peer review aspect has been removed, subverting the normal procedure.”

One source told the Intercept, “Management has decided to commit to keeping this stuff secret,” and are “holding any Dragonfly-specific documents out of [employees’] review tools, so that promotion is decided only by a committee that is read in on Dragonfly.”

Project Dragonfly is a censored Chinese search app, which will reportedly blacklist terms and searches about human rights, democracy, and protest, and link searches to searchers’ phone numbers.

Those working on Project Dragonfly were reportedly ordered by management at Google to “keep quiet” about the project, “deflect questions,” and cover paper trails, and news of the project led to widespread condemnation from hundreds of Google employees, human rights organizations, Republican and Democrat congressmen, and Vice President Mike Pence— who claimed Project Dragonfly would “strengthen Communist Party censorship and compromise the privacy of Chinese customers.”

During a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee in December, Google CEO Sundar Pichai claimed the company had “no plans” to “launch a search product in China,” however a number of people have claimed that development is still going.

Following Pichai’s claims that Google was not working on Project Dragonfly, the Verge declared that Pichai “made it clear that, whether the company currently has ‘plans’ to launch the product, Google certainly hasn’t halted work completely.”

“In fact, it has continued to devote substantial resources to the project. While saying the effort was ‘limited,’ Pichai at one point said Google had devoted about 100 people to it, although The Intercept has reported the number is closer to 300,” the Verge continued.


Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) sent a letter to Google CEO Sundar Pichai Thursday, demanding the Silicon Valley executive clarify the company’s relationship with the Chinese government and its reluctance to partner with the Pentagon.

Hawley said in an interview with Fox News Thursday, “This is a problem. I think Google’s ever-shifting answers on this, I’ve said that they need come out publicly and say exactly why they are prioritizing China over the United States of America, the Chinese government over United States citizens.”

“So let’s hear from Google on the record, let’s hear directly,” Sen. Hawley added.

President Donald Trump revealed Wednesday that he met with Google chief executive Pichai, suggesting that the meeting went “very well.”

Pichai met with Trump after Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Joseph Dunford testified that Google’s artificial intelligence (AI) work with the Chinese government would benefit their military. Hawley’s question to Dunford during a March Senate Armed Services Committee hearing helped spark the conversation over Google’s questionable relationship with China, in which Dunford said that Google was providing a “direct benefit” to the Chinese military.

Hawley said that Google was “a supposedly American company.”

Google also canceled a Pentagon project in 2018 to help develop artificial intelligence capabilities but open an AI research center in Beijing, China.

“He stated strongly that he is totally committed to the U.S. Military, not the Chinese Military,” Trump wrote in a tweet Wednesday. “Also discussed political fairness and various things that Google can do for our Country.”

Hawley sent a letter to Pichai asking him to address the social media giant’s refusal to work with the Department of Defense (DOD) while partnering with China.

“I have been deeply troubled by the testimony of our national defense leadership regarding Google’s unwillingness to partner with the U.S. Armed Forces, even while pursuing lucrative projects in China that directly or indirectly benefit the repressive Chinese government,” Hawley wrote in his letter to Pichai.

In the letter Hawley also reported that Google’s work on AI may “be used by Chinese military and intelligence services to exploit Americans’ data and privacy” but would also develop a products counter to American beliefs in free expression by helping develop a Google “censor-friendly” search engine in China reportedly called “Project Dragonfly.”

The Missouri conservative also noted how China frequently violates human rights, saying:

It is worth asking what Google stands to gain from partnering with a country that routinely violates basic human liberties, including maintaining detention facilities for nearly a million Uyghur Muslims, banning freedom of speech and the press, and repressing its Christian, Tibetan Buddhist and other religious communities. Is the technology Google develops, ostensibly for the welfare of consumers, being used by the Chinese government to further perpetuate these human rights violations?

Hawley called for Pichai to explain his company’s relationship with the Chinese government.

“I understand that today you have met with General Dunford and the President of the United States to address these concerns,” Hawley concluded in his letter. “Now meet with the American people by addressing publicly the work your company does in China, the benefits it may provide to the Chinese government and military, and your reluctance to partner or aid the Armed Forces of the United States.”


The victim of a Bradford grooming gang has said that most girls at the children’s care home where she lived were being sexually exploited and has called for an inquiry, alleging that child rape gangs across the country — including in Rochdale and Rotherham — are linked.

Fiona Goddard, 25, told BBC Look North, “I lived in a care home and I know that most of the girls, barring about three, were all getting sexually exploited as well.

“I also met numerous girls while we were out with other guys that maybe didn’t come from care homes, but came from broken backgrounds and they were all getting exploited.”

On the extent and organisation of the abuse she said, “When I was at that house [where she was raped], people came from Birmingham, Rochdale, Rotherham, Blackburn, Glasgow, Oxford.

“It is widespread and they are all linked.”

“There definitely needs to be a public inquiry; it needs to be an independent one,” she added.

Bradford Council’s interim child services chief Gladys Rhodes White said of Ms Goddard’s call for an iquiry, “I’m not seeing evidence that there is a wide-scale, large issue specific to Bradford.

“I think if it did come to light that there were lots of victims that had been missed,” she added, it would be something the Safeguarding Board would want to “look at”.

Ms Goddard came forward with her complaint in 2014, after seeing a report on the abuse of more than 1,500 girls in Rotherham, and warned that while some rape survivors had gone to the police, “there are girls that either lack the understanding or aren’t in the situation where they can [come forward].”

She gave evidence in a trial at Bradford Crown Court last month that resulted in the convictions of Parvaze Ahmed, 36, Naveed Akhtar, 43, Saeed Akhtar, 55, Zeeshan Ali, 32, Keiran Harris, 28, Izar Hussain, 32, Fahim Iqbal, 28, Basharat Khaliq, 38, and Mohammed Usman, 31.

The child rapists were found guilty of 22 offences including inciting child prostitution and rape, in abuse that began in 2008 when she and another unnamed victim were 14 years old; all nine were given terms of between 18 and 20 years — but will likely be released from prison much earlier.

The young woman waived her lifelong right to anonymity to discuss her case and reach out to other potential victims of grooming gangs.

Authorities at cities across the country, notably Rotherham, Rochdale, and Telford, have been accused of ignoring the abuse of white, working-class girls –a recently-publicised report also highlighted the abuse Sikh girls across the country — by predominantly Muslim gangs of Pakistani heritage, who groomed and raped vulnerable children often from broken homes.

Child rape survivors and whistleblowers have reported that while some politically correct authorities refused to tackle the issue for fear of being labelled racist, while others treated the victims as the authors of their own victimisation, with police in Rotherham and Rochdale regarding the children as prostitutes.

The European Commission has announced that all of its preparatory work for a clean, No Deal Brexit is complete — four days before the United Kingdom was officially scheduled to leave the bloc.

“As it is increasingly likely that the United Kingdom will leave the European Union without a deal on 12 April, the European Commission has today completed its ‘no-deal’ preparations,” the EU’s executive branch said in a statement on Monday.

“While a ‘no-deal’ scenario is not desirable, the EU is prepared for it,” the statement added.

The European Council — a council of EU member-states’ leaders, minus the United Kingdom for Brexit purposes — had granted a three-week extension of the Article 50 negotiating period to Prime Minister Theresa May, to try and pass her Withdrawal Agreement — but the Tory leader was notified that, “if the Withdrawal Agreement is not ratified by Friday 29 March, a ‘no-deal’ scenario may occur on 12 April.”

The Tories now say a longer delay is possible, to either renegotiate the deal or to try several more times to pass the Withdrawal Agreement, while the House of Commons has voted to rule out No Deal.

However, Brussels’ chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier told the British last week to “finalise preparations for No Deal”, as the Remainer-dominated House of Commons voting against a clean exit “does not prevent it from happening.”

This may mean that it is the intransigence of the European Union that results in Brexit being delivered, if it does finally go ahead, despite the efforts of the British political establishment to stop or frustrate the process.

French churches are coming increasingly under attack with an average of nearly three churches per day targetted for vandalism alone over the past three years.

A report from the Central Criminal Intelligence Service (SCRC) of the gendarmerie noted that from 2016 to 2018 there had been thousands of cases of church vandalism, peaking in 2017 with 1,045 cases, Le Figaro reports.

According to the French Ministry of the Interior, when cemeteries and other sites are taken into consideration, the number of acts of vandalism rose to 1,063 in 2018.

Earlier this year, in one week alone France saw twelve churches vandalised, including attackers attempting to set fire to the church of Saint-Sulpice in Paris.

In Nimes, an even more heinous attack occurred, with vandals smearing faeces on the wall of the church of Notre-Dame des Enfants and stealing objects from the altar.

Twelve French Churches Attacked, Vandalised in One Week https://t.co/a5joSgIVdW — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 20, 2019

In March, the over 800-year-old Basilica of Saint-Denis in the now heavily migrant-populated suburbs of Paris was also vandalised, with the basilica’s organ being heavily damaged and stained glass windows were broken.

Thefts of religious objects have seen an increase since 2016, rising from 121 to 129 in 2018. According to the gendarmes, the thefts are mostly opportunistic, and in some rare cases are carried out by organised crime groups.

They added that churches are often an easy target for criminals due to the fact that many are left open to the public. “These thefts have no anti-Christian motivation but indeed a financial interest,” they claimed, and added that a chalice can be sold for 200 to 2,000 euros.

Last September, French authorities arrested a pair of Romanian migrants who were suspected to be behind a number of church thefts in both Paris and the suburbs of the city. The pair had allegedly stolen up to 70,000 euros worth of property.

Some have actively spoken out against the rise in anti-Christian acts in France, such as Cardinal Robert Sarah, who said: “They are the sad reflection of a sick civilisation that lets itself be swept away in the nets of evil. The bishops, priests, and the faithful must keep up their strength and courage.”

Brexiteers are much nicer people than Remainers, experts have confirmed.

We know thanks to research produced by political analyst Matthew Goodwin. On every metric, Brexiteers turn out to be kinder, more generous spirited, more tolerant and forgiving than spiteful, nasty, vengeful, bitter Remainers.

Here are the results of his research:

Then we asked about a slightly closer relationship. "Would you feel willing/unwilling to have a Remainer/Leaver as a co-worker?" 79% of Leavers would be willing, but only 67% of Remainers felt the same way pic.twitter.com/xMM25PacsG — Matthew Goodwin (@GoodwinMJ) March 29, 2019

How about an even closer relationship – how about having a Remainer/Leaver as friend? 80% of Leavers would, but only 61% of Remainers feel the same way … pic.twitter.com/PlA3fktDhF — Matthew Goodwin (@GoodwinMJ) March 29, 2019

Another way of looking at this is to ask Remainers and Leavers to give the other side a rating on a 0-10 thermometer scale Which looks like this pic.twitter.com/DzVLS4UoDS — Matthew Goodwin (@GoodwinMJ) March 29, 2019

None of this will come as the remotest surprise to the many Brexiteers who have lost friends, work, or even jobs as a result of the prejudice directed at them by Remainers. There is plenty of anecdotal evidence that this has been happening across Britain ever since the Remainers lost the Referendum nearly three years ago. But rarely if ever do you hear stories of it happening the other way round: Brexiteers giving the cold shoulder to Remainers or driving them out of their jobs.

Anyone who attended yesterday’s Brexit Betrayal rally in Parliament Square, London, would have noticed this truth: that Brexiteers are, on the whole, exceptionally likeable people. They’re more interesting, more eccentric, more tolerant, funnier and with, perhaps, more hinterland. Yes, of course there are lovely people who voted Remain too. But quite a few of them were at yesterday’s demo telling me how they’d switched their allegiance since because they were disgusted by the intransigence of the EU/the unpleasantness of their fellow Remainers/the sabotage of the democratic process by Remain parliament.

Anyway, I hope you’ll find time to watch the videos I made which I think capture quite well the flavour of the day. They include chats with the fragrant TalkRadio host Julia Hartley-Brewer, the scarily fluent Nigel Farage (speaking off the cuff moments before he was due to give his speech: “You’ve done this before,” I suggested. “Just a bit,” he replied), comedian Dominic Frisby (author/performer of the magnificent Brexit song 17 Million F*ck Offs), plus lots of other delightful people who aren’t quite so famous.

It was a wonderful day. The sun shone. Everyone was in a good mood, despite the failure of Parliament to observe the most basic principles of democracy.

God wants Brexit to happen, that much was clear. So one day it will.

The Independent Group (TIG) of breakaway, anti-Brexit MPs from the Labour Party and the Tory left have officially registered as a new politcal party, under the moniker Change UK (CUK).

On the day when the United Kingdom was supposed to be leaving the European Union, the globalist, largely left-liberal “centrists” formerly of the Labour MPs — Chuka Umunna, Gavin Shuker, Luciana Berger, Ann Coffey, Mike Gapes, Chris Leslie, Joan Ryan, and Angela Smith — and the Tory Party — Anna Soubry, Heidi Allen, and Sarah Wollaston — announced they were formally instituting their new parliamentary faction as a political party, Change UK (CUK).

The Independent Group has become a political party: Change UK. — Britain Elects (@britainelects) March 29, 2019

“Tens of thousands of people who signed up to support The Independent Group and thousands of people have been urging us to put forward candidates in the European [Parliament] elections,” beamed Mr Umunna, hitherto regarded as the group’s ad hoc leader, in a video announcement, alongside Ms Allen, who he announced as interim leader.

The United Kingdom is not supposed to be participating in the EU elections in May as things stand, as it is supposed to be leaving the European Union — but it is widely expected that, in the absence of an agreed deal with the bloc, Britain’s Remain-dominated Parliament will move swiftly to scotch a No Deal Brexit on the new No Deal exit deadline of April 12th, and seek a long delay.

This would likely see Britain take part in the EU elections after all — which CUK reportedly believes could act as something of a proxy for a re-run of the EU referendum in 2016.

The group’s formation has not met with universal acclaim, however, with some Brexiteers suggesting it does not make sense for a group which is attempting to resist change, in the form of Britain leaving the European Union in line with the people’s vote to cut ties with the bloc in 2016.

It may also face some resistance from petitions website Change.org, which has indicated that it believes the new name infringes on its brand.

President of the European Council Donald Tusk said that it would be “unacceptable” to “betray” the people who signed an online petition and marched in London to stop Brexit.

Addressing the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, on Wednesday morning the Polish progressive said that he maintains the European Council should be “open” to a long Article 50 delay “if the UK wishes to rethink its Brexit strategy, which would, of course, mean the UK’s participation in the European Parliament elections. And then there were voices saying that this would be harmful or inconvenient to some of you.

“Let me be clear: such thinking is unacceptable. You cannot betray the six million people who signed the petition to revoke Article 50, the one million people who marched for a People’s Vote, or the increasing majority of people who want to remain in the European Union.”

Mr Tusk added, “They may feel that they are not sufficiently represented by the UK parliament, but they must feel that they are represented by you in this chamber. Because they are Europeans.”

Farage to EU: ‘Do You Really Want Me Back? Reject Brexit Delay, Get UK Out’ https://t.co/HImm8GnOCJ — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 27, 2019

While 17.4 million people voted in a legally-binding referendum to leave the European Union in June 2016, Tusk seeks to elevate the “one million people” who marched on a demonstration organised by establishment politicians, the numbers of which one crowd science specialist estimated at being actually far less at between 312,000 and 400,000 people.

As for the online petition, a recent poll showed that 52 per cent of Britons believe the petition to cancel Brexit, which passed the five million mark on Sunday, is “irrelevant” — that majority including 28 per cent Remainers.

And recent polling has also found that staying in the EU has only 35 per cent support, whereas the combined leave options (including leaving on WTO terms on Friday or leaving after a delay) is supported by 50 per cent of those surveyed.

German Left Party MEP Gabriele Zimmer shared a similar sentiment to Tusk in the European chamber on Wednesday, saying that while “we have to act in a way that shows full respect for those that voted for Brexit in the referendum” the European parliamentarians “need to act in full respect of those who demonstrated in London at the weekend and we act in respect of those who signed an online petition.”

Brussels has not consistently “respected” the democratic expressions of its member states in the past, however, with countries being asked to vote again — if voting against the EU — until they gave the right answer.

Denmark voted against the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 and was asked to vote again; the Republic of Ireland voted against the Nice Treaty in 2001 and was made to vote again; France and the Netherlands voted against the EU Constitution in 2005 but were ignored; and Ireland voted against the Lisbon Treaty in 2008, but was asked to vote again.


Having persistently failed to deliver Brexit almost three years after the 2016 vote, members of the British Parliament are voting on a series of potential Brexit options to determine how they want to take Brexit forwards.

The so-called indicative votes, which are not binding on the government, come over 1,000 days after the 2016 referendum returned the greatest democratic mandate for change in British political history, and very nearly two years after the government triggered the Article 50 process to take Britain out of the EU. The original date for Brexit is just two days away, but the government has now agreed with the European Union to extend that into April.

The last-minute votes, therefore, come at the end of the first stage of the Brexit process and as the UK government is all but paralysed by a so-called Brexit ‘deal’ negotiated by the Prime Minister with the European Union. While Parliament has been unwilling on two occasions to accept May’s deal, the European Union is unwilling to revisit it to make changes, and the Prime Minister will not accept any other course of action.

While the Westminster political-media bubble are treating tonight’s votes as holding some importance, the government Cabinet is boycotting them, and concentrating their energy on getting the deal — described as the worst in history by key Brexiteer Nigel Farage — through Parliament later this week.

UPDATE 2200 — Final thoughts

Politicians are uniquely unable to made a decision on Brexit. Thankfully for them, the British people already did so in 2016. They might very well reflect on that after this evening. Goodnight.

So even after the indicative votes, there's simply no majority for any option. It's a good time to remember that it's precisely because politicians couldn't resolve the EU issue that the matter was put to the people in 2016 by Parliament. Perhaps they'll implement that decision. — Dia Chakravarty (@DiaChakravarty) March 27, 2019

UPDATE 2150 — What does this mean

Despite the great noise Parliament made about taking control of proceedings from the government to give their own view, Parliament has now failed to support any single proposition — voting against every single of the eight options.

This rather confirms the view held by some critics of indicative votes that they have a somewhat farcical quality and are inclined to create or enforce stalemates — something similar happened in the Tony Blair years when looking at options for House of Lords reform.

We are returned to square one, in some regards, therefore. The government goes back to trying to push Theresa May’s treaty with the European Union onto a Commons which doesn’t want it — or apparently anything else — in face of resistance from both Brexiteer Tories and the Ulster DUP (see update 2050).

Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay told the House after the vote:

The deal the government has negotiated is a compromise both with the EU and with members across this House. That is the nature of complex negotiation. The results of the process this House has gone through today strengthens our view that the deal the government has negotiated is the best option. Furthermore, although this was not a significant feature of today’s debate, any deal must include a withdrawal agreement. It is the government’s firm wish to get the agreement approved by this House and I urge all members… if you believe in delivering on the referendum result with a deal then its necessary to back the Withdrawal Agreement. If we do not do that there are no guarantees about where this process will end. I call on all members in the national interested to back the prime minister’s deal.

UPDATE 2145 — Parliament votes against everything!

The results are in:

Option B — John Baron MP

Leave the EU without a deal in a clean break on April 12

YES: 160

NO: 400

Majority: 240 Option D — Nick Boles MP

UPDATE 2135 — Parliament excited by ceremonial mace

The counting process for the indicative votes had proven sufficiently complex that it has, several hours after the vote took place, not yet been completed yet.

Speaker Bercow has suspended the sitting briefly while we wait for the numbers to come in, vacating the chair, but the fact the ceremonial mace that symbolises the authority of the Monarch in Parliament remains in place. This is causing considerable excitement among MPs because it is supposed to be removed when the House is suspended, apparently even if only briefly.

Tory MPs are highlighting the situation by raising points of orders to the speaker — who is not present — effectively addressing an empty chair.

For more information on the mace, you can read our December 2018 report which followed a Labour MP seizing the mace in protest against the Brexit process.

UPDATE 2120 — Brexit officially delayed

British law has now been brought in line with the agreement Theresa May struck with the European Union, that Brexit day not be March 29th.

There is now no hope whatsoever that the country could leave the European Union this week — that possibility has been thoroughly stitched up by Theresa May and the predominantly remain-supporting Parliament, voting 441 to 105 in favour of the change.

Remarkably as many as 105 voted against the change, likely all Conservative Eurosceptics.

STATUTORY INSTRUMENT: Move EU exit day to 22 May if deal approved by 29 March, or 12 April of no deal approved.

YES: 441

NO: 105

Majority: 336

UPDATE 2050 — DUP won’t back May’s deal

Bad news for the Prime Minister as her confidence and supply partners the Ulster-based Democratic Unionist Party still refuse to back her deal which, being honest, dooms it to fail once again.

Many Conservative rebels watch the DUP as gatekeepers of the deal, suggesting they would vote for May’s Brexit deal if the DUP do. Jacob Rees-Mogg, surprising some, is now among that number. No DUP, no Tory rebels — meaning the Prime Minister may choose to once again delay the vote on her deal until she can get enough support.

But how long can she go on delaying? With Brexit delayed until April, the number of Parliamentary days left to vote again are extremely limited. And where does this leave the Prime Minister’s promise to Conservative backbenchers that she would leave office after getting her deal through?

The DUP do not abstain on the Union. https://t.co/l4oSPj75V2 — Nigel Dodds (@NigelDoddsDUP) March 27, 2019

UPDATE 2015 — Parliament has voted on the eight options

The votes are now being counted — with eight binary options per ballot paper and roughly 650 members eligible to vote, this may take some time — likely beyond 2100. Stay tuned, folks.

In the meanwhile, Parliament is debating changing the Brexit date from March 29th — this Friday — to April. While the government has already agreed to do this over the head of Parliament with the European Union, this vote is needed to harmonise the British legal position with its international position. Given both the government and the opposition Labour party support delaying Brexit, this is all but certain to pass.

The day’s events so far:

1800 — Theresa May offers her resignation to get her deal through

Evidently, getting Theresa May’s deal — which she has spent the two years negotiating with the European Union to achieve — is the Prime Minister’s primary concern, and she has now gone so far as promising to step down in return for getting it through Parliament.

This in particular means the country will have a new leader during phase two of the Brexit process. During this time, the country — presuming May’s deal passes — will have technically left the European Union while remaining in, in all important respects. The country will then negotiate the future relationship with Europe, a task which will almost certainly be more difficult and fraught with danger than what we’ve already experienced, hard to believe as it is.

The job is made much harder, in many respects, by Theresa May’s deeply controversial deal which will have paid out tens of billions of pounds sterling to the European Union for little to nothing in return, and locked the nation into the so-called Northern Ireland backstop. With hands bound by these and other conditions, a new leader must then negotiate their way into the free world. Little wonder Mrs May won’t be doing it herself.

Michael Gove presently leads the pack according to the bookies. Read the full story on Breitbart London:

1500 — Bercow sets amendments

16 voting options were put to the pro-Remain speaker of the House of Commons for consideration today, of which he picked eight — six remain, one status-quo, and one pro-Remain.

Remarkably, the voting position that called on Parliament to affirm it would be honouring the vote of the British people was ignored. Read into that what you will.

From our update earlier today, those selected amendments we will be hearing more of soon:

‘B’ — No Deal A simply worded option brought by Tory Brexiteer John Baron, which you can pretty much guarantee won’t get much support from the overwhelmingly anti-Brexit Parliament. The text of this is simply: “That this House agrees that the UK shall leave the EU on 12 April 2019 without a deal.”

‘D’ — Calling for a Common Market ‘2.0’ Brought by a group of Conservative and Labour Europhiles including Nick Boles, this would call upon the government to revise the present political declaration to ensure the United Kingdom is a member of the European Free Trade Association and later the European Economic Area. Has the impact of keeping the UK in the European single market — breaking a key test of whether Britain has actually left the European Union or not.

‘H’ — Almost the same again Also calls, like the above, for the country to go with EFTA and the EEA but not remain within the single market. As the UK will leave the EEA on Brexit day (should that day ever come), it would have to negotiate, presumably, to be let back in.

‘J’ — Ken Clarke’s Customs Union proposal Mr Ken Clarke is one of the most recognisable veterans of the Conservative benches — he has been serving within and without the Cabinet since the 1970s and was a key figure in getting Britain to join the forerunner of the European Union in the first place. Perhaps unsurprisingly given that, he’s worked tirelessly against Brexit. His proposal would ensure that “as a minimum, [Britain should have] a commitment to negotiate a permanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs union with the EU.”

‘K’ — Labour’s plan Brought in the name of Jeremy Corbyn, this is the opposition’s idea of what Brexit should be — bearing in mind their 2017 election manifesto said they would respect the 2016 referendum vote to leave. They are calling for a permanent customs union with the EU, a “close alignment with the single market” complete with shared institutions, obligations, and “dynamic alignment”, participation in EU agencies and funding, and cooperation on security arrangements and the much-criticised European Arrest Warrant. In other words, staying in the European Union in all but name.

‘L’ — Cancel Brexit If the house doesn’t pass Theresa May’s deal, which we can fairly certainly say it will not — having already declined it twice — this vote calls on the government to cancel Brexit altogether. This is so Britain avoids the outcome Parliament wants least, a full Brexit.

‘M’ — A Second Referendum Referred to in the vote brought by Dame Margaret Beckett as a ‘confirmatory vote’, meaning that whatever deal the house agrees would be then voted on by the public before actually going ahead, this appears to be a call for a second referendum by another name.

‘O’ — Calling on the govt to seek preferential trade arrangements with the EU Does what it says on the tin, it seems. In case of no deal being struck with the EU before the nation leaves, the house calls on the government to agree trade arrangements with the EU, essentially to keep things exactly as they are in the short term.

One by one the last true blue Tory diehards are caving on Brexit. Even Jacob Rees-Mogg now concedes that the time has come to give up the fight and accept that Theresa May’s glitter-dipped turd of a Withdrawal Agreement is still preferable to no Brexit at all.

So isn’t that a sign that we should all bow to the inevitable and accept that we’re beaten? It’s not our fault. We fought a good fight. But parliament has so rigged it that we cannot possibly win. Time to accept defeat with a grace that has been wholly lacking among our unscrupulous, shrill, devious adversaries, right?

Wrong.

When you’re winning a game of chess and your opponent decides to stop you by petulantly picking up the board and flinging all the pieces into the air, is that really the signal that you’ve lost? Of course it isn’t. It’s a sign that the gloves are off and that in this escalated conflict the rules of chess no longer apply.

This is what I don’t understand about the squishy conservative commentators I’ve been reading on Twitter cucksplaining to me that the mature and sensible thing to do is to simply to surrender to May and the Remainers because numbers and realpolitik. They’re still thinking in terms of the rules of a game that our opponents stopped playing some while ago.

Some of these ‘pragmatists’ have got so carried away with their craven pusillanimity masquerading as grand strategy that they’ve even persuaded themselves that the people really most to blame for the failure of Brexit are — no wait for it, you’re going to love this… — the European Research Group.

Well done ERG die hards! This is working out brilliantly! Genius strategy. Such wizardry. — Iain Martin (@iainmartin1) March 25, 2019

No. I did not fake that tweet. The European Research Group (ERG) are the group of MPs who have fought hardest to secure a Brexit approximating to the one 17.4 million people voted for in June 2016. How could any self-respecting political commentator — let alone one who has on occasion expressed Brexiteer sympathies — possibly wish to vent his spleen on about the only politicians who have emerged from this squalid, ugly, anti-democratic affair with their honour and principles intact?

The short answer to that question is: Brexit has made lunatics and monsters and idiots and fiends of us all. Like the Civil War it has set brother against brother, father against son, husband against wife, old mate against old mate, town against country, north against south, hard Brexiteer against even harder Brexiteer, Etonian against Etonian…

I’d do almost anything to recapture the prelapsarian innocence of those years before June 2016, when you neither knew nor cared what your neighbour’s position on Europe was — and certainly wouldn’t have hated him for it if you’d found out. Anything that is, apart from denying the British people their Brexit referendum.

That referendum wasn’t — as many Remainers, of course, insisted once they’d lost — a terrible mistake by David Cameron. It was, in fact, the only right and decent decision he made in his entire political career.

Britain needed the referendum because the chasm between the political elite and the people had grown more wide and deep than is healthy for a functioning, stable democracy. Cameron understood this and thought that the referendum would act as a pressure valve to release all that pent-up tension.

What Cameron didn’t understand — none of the liberal elite did, nor has it understood since — is that it’s not enough merely to give the proles a chance to express their discontent at the ballot box. What you then have to do is deliver what all those proles voted for, however unpalatable you and your fancy Westminster chums and mates in the big law firms and the civil service and the City and at the BBC may find their decision.

This, as we know, the Remainer elite has failed to do. It hasn’t merely failed to deliver Brexit through incompetence or indolence. Rather it has actively, shamelessly, vauntingly, and very publicly conspired in every way possible to exploit whatever cheats and loopholes it can to make damn sure that Brexit never actually happens. And for the foreseeable future, it seems likely that meaningful Brexit won’t happen, because that’s what happens when you have a government and a parliament dominated by Remainers who’ve given up on democracy because killing Brexit is the only thing that matters to them.

But far from being the end of the turmoil which has made Britain such a fraught, bitter, and divided place to live these last few years, this parliamentary destruction of Brexit is not the end of everything we Leavers have fought for but just the beginning.

Douglas Carswell puts it well in this tweet:

Ask yourself when you last heard anyone in the UK these past two years make a positive case for the EU from first principle? Me, neither. It’s only about being anti Brexiteer. This is why we win. #LongMarch — Douglas Carswell (@DouglasCarswell) March 26, 2019

He’s right. Remainers believe in little more than propping up the crumbling status quo. When I say “in little more than” I am perhaps being overgenerous. Like Carswell, I have never yet met a Remainer capable of making a positive case for Britain’s ongoing membership — or, as now seems likely, non-membership but with most of the costs and all the drawbacks of membership — of the European Union.

They define themselves, rather, by their virtuous and high-minded loathing of Brexiteers: how ignorant and ill-educated they are; how racist; how Little Englander-ish; how xenophobic.

Brexiteers, on the other hand, have a sense of purpose and direction. They know exactly what they want and since they voted for it on June 23 2016 they haven’t budged an inch from that desire.

One way or another full Brexit is inevitable. It’s just a question of when, not if.


The House of Commons has voted on a series of amendments to a Government motion, allowing Remain MPs to take control of the Brexit process from the Prime Minister.

This came after Theresa May postponed a third vote on her Withdrawal Agreement — which might never be held at all now.

The Government whipped Tory MPs to oppose the proposed power grabs, which they believe would set a dangerous and disruptive constitutional precedent — but the one tabled by Oliver Letwin MP, a Tory Remainer, was passed successfully, with the aid of a number of Remain-supporting ministers who rebelled against the Prime Minister to back them.

Brexit campaign leader Nigel Farage warned the country was “witnessing the death of British democracy in slow motion”, while a spokesman for the Brexit department lamented the “dangerous, unpredictable precedent” the new, possibly unprecedented arrangements set.

This article now closed. Live updates and the initial report explaining the amendments and their background can be viewed below.

UPDATE: 10:55 p.m. — A spokesman for the Brexit department has expressed the Government’s dismay at the “dangerous, unpredictable precedent” set by the success of the Letwin amendment (see below), which allows the Remain-dominated House of Commons to take over the direction of the Brexit process from the executive in many respects.

It is disappointing to see this amendment pass, as the Government made a clear commitment to provide a process to find a majority in Parliament for a way forward this week. This amendment instead upends the balance between our democratic institutions and sets a dangerous, unpredictable precedent for the future. While it is now up to Parliament to set out next steps in respect of this amendment, the Government will continue to call for realism – any options considered must be deliverable in negotiations with the EU. Parliament should take account of how long these negotiations would take, and if they’d require a longer extension which would mean holding European parliamentary elections.

UPDATE: 10:50 p.m. — MPs have backed the main motion by 327 to 300 — effectively a simple confirmation of the Oliver amendment, already backed in the first vote of the night.

UPDATE, 10:35 p.m. — Dame Margaret Beckett’s Amendment F, described below, has been narrowly defeated, 314 votes to 311 — although this may be small consolation to Mrs May, given the success of Oliver Letwin’s Amendment A.

Frankly there is no conspicuous logic to MPs backing Letwin and not Beckett. But that is the Brexit Commons for you — Robert Peston (@Peston) March 25, 2019

UPDATE, 10:15 p.m. — Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn pulled his amendment, described below, allowing MPs to move directly to Remain-supporting Tory MP Oliver Letwin’s Amendment A, also described below.

Letwin’s amendment passed by 329 votes to 302, apparently with the help of at three Remain-supporting Government ministers, Richard Harrington, Alistair Burt, and Steve Brine, the first of whom is known to have formally resigned his position.

Ministerial resignation count stands at 3 so far tonight: Richard Harrington (not a huge surprise), Alistair Burt (particular blow to the PM) and Steve Brine. — Kate McCann (@KateEMcCann) March 25, 2019

UPDATE, 10 p.m. — As voting on the amendments get underway, Remain-supporting business minister Richard Harrington — who openly dared the Prime Minister to sack him if she intended to deliver a No Deal Brexit — has resigned, likely in order to vote against the Government.

Original story continues below:

The announcement came after Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which props up the minority Tory government in Parliament, indicated that it could not support her deal.

Mrs May told the House of Commons this afternoon that, while she regrets that Britain will not be leaving the EU on March 29th, as she promised 108 times, “unless this House agrees to it, ‘No Deal’ will not happen.”

The House of Commons has already voted in principle against leaving without a deal in any circumstances.

Seven amendments were tabled and the House of Commons’ Speaker John Bercow has selected the following three to be debated and voted on:

Amendment A — Oliver Letwin

The amendment would to a great extent allow Parliament to seize power from the Government on Brexit, allowing MPs to put forward business motions relating to Brexit in a series of indicative (non-binding) votes. The amendment does not specify which options will be voted on.

Mr Letwin, a Tory Remainer, said “The purpose of this cross-party amendment is to enable the House of Commons to debate and vote on alternative ways forward if the PM’s Brexit deal is not approved by Wednesday.”

.@oletwinofficial is now moving his Amendment (a) to the #BrexitNextSteps motion. We asked him to explain why he put this amendment forward. pic.twitter.com/0rQfMv0ui2 — UK House of Commons (@HouseofCommons) March 25, 2019

Prime Minister Theresa May has warned however that handing over the Commons agenda — normally controlled by Government — to Parliament would set an “unwelcome” constitutional precedent.

Amendment D — Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party

This calls on the Government “to provide sufficient parliamentary time this week for this house to find a majority for a different approach” in a series of indicative votes. The votes would be intended to gauge what options command a majority amongst parliamentarians.

The Labour leader has indicated that alternatives could include his party’s Brexit plan, a customs union, or a second referendum.

Amendment F — Dame Margaret Beckett

Dame Margaret’s amendment states that in the case of a No Deal scenario, seven days before the United Kingdom leaves the EU the House of Commons should be recalled to consider a motion on whether MPs approve the move, in indicative votes, or back requesting an extension to Article 50, the legal mechanism for leaving the bloc.

A new populist, Eurosceptic party has achieved the remarkable feat of going from zero seats to becoming the largest single party in the Dutch Senate in a single election, as a young politician likened to a “Dutch Donald Trump” beat seasoned professionals in Wednesday’s poll.

Thierry Baudet’s Forum for Democracy party, which has gained attention for its Euroscepticism, campaigned against open borders politics and against what he calls “climate-change hysteria,” winning 86 seats across the Dutch regions. The victory put his party ahead of even the ruling mainstream conservative People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), which achieved 80 seats.

Forum was founded in 2016, and this is the first regional election the party has contested. Remarkably, in some Dutch regions Forum was so unexpectedly successful it won the right to appoint more elected members than they actually have registered candidates living in those areas.

BREAKING: Turkish Born Utrecht Tram Shooting Suspect Charged with Terror Offences https://t.co/mtSyC49lZ6 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 21, 2019

The regional seats translate through the Dutch constitutional system into seats in the appointed upper house Senate. The party will have 13 seats, making them the largest group — and robbing the governing VVD of their majority.

Speaking to Dutch media, leader Thierry Baudet said he was willing to support the establishment parties in government but would demand a “change of course” in certain policy areas, specifically mass migration and government spending on climate change policies. Showing the party’s newfound power, Baudet even demanded the resignation of several key cabinet ministers, including those responsible for home affairs and immigration, in return for support.

Unlike other countries where establishment parties have totally ruled out working with populist insurgents, even when they hold seats key to establishing a working government, the Netherlands’ centrist-right Prime Minister Mark Rutte said Thursday he would be willing to consider working with Forum to keep the government in power.

Wednesday’s election came just two days after what is now understood to have been a terror attack in the Dutch city of Utrecht, which some media commentators both inside the Netherlands and without have said may have influenced the way people chose to vote.

Baudet himself was criticised after the attack for continuing his election campaigning, while others called off rallies. Speaking on the campaign trail, Baudet attacked the governing parties for their role in contributing to the circumstances surrounding the attack, including “naive and lax” policies on open borders and criminal justice.

Arguing that despite decades of warnings about the impact of mass migration, “nothing has changed on this road we are following, with hundreds of thousands of people still coming here”, Baudet warned Dutch voters: “If we don’t choose a different course on Wednesday, [events like this week’s shooting] will happen much more often.”

Criticising the Prime Minister, he said: “We are being destroyed by the people who are supposed to be protecting us… Successive Rutte governments have left our borders wide open, letting in hundreds of thousands of people with cultures completely different to ours.”

Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad reports several news sources have likened the “television genius” Baudet to U.S. President Donald Trump, who connected directly with voters through social media, bypassing the legacy mainstream media.

The unexpected degree of success for Forum reflects and reinforces a broader trend across Europe which sees populist parties giving an authentic voice to concerns held by voters at the expense of traditional, established parties. This trend is broadly anticipated to continue in the European Union’s parliament elections, with as many as one in four voters across the continent expected to vote populist.

Breitbart London reported that among those parties hoping to pick up votes in the European Parliament elections is the Sweden Democrats, which is set to double their representation and the Italian League — led by populist interior minister Matteo Salvini — which may become the second largest party in Europe.

The Home Office has rejected the asylum application of a Christian convert from Iran who said they had been drawn to the faith by its peaceful nature, due to a Government official ruling that Christianity is not peaceful.

The applicant indicated that they had converted to Christianity from Islam because of its peaceful nature, stating that “In Islam there is violence, rage and revenge. In Christianity in the contrary it is talking about peace, forgiveness and kindness.”

This earned the ire of the Home Office bureaucrat or bureaucrats charged with assessing the application, the Times reports.

The official cobbled together six passages from the King James Version and New Internation Version of the Old and New Testaments — such as Matthew 10:34, in which Christ proclaims he “came not to send peace, but a sword” — in an effort to prove that the applicant’s view of Christianity was wrong, and that Christian scripture is in fact “filled with imagery of revenge, destruction, death and violence”.

“These examples are inconsistent with your claim that you converted to Christianity after discovering it is a ‘peaceful’ religion, as opposed to Islam which contains violence, rage and revenge,” the rejection letter to the applicant admonishes passive-aggressively; an implicit ruling that Christianity is not peaceful — certainly not relative to Islam — and indeed is so clearly not peaceful that the Home Office does not consider perceived peacefulness a credible reason for conversion.

“I am extremely concerned that a Government department could determine the future of another human being based on such a profound misunderstanding of the texts and practices of faith communities,” commented Paul Butler, Bishop of Durham for the Church of England.

“To use extracts from the Book of Revelation to argue that Christianity is a violent religion is like arguing that a Government report on the impact of Climate Change is advocating drought and flooding,” he added.

The United Kingdom is, at least nominally, a Christian country, with the Queen also serving as the Supreme Governor of the established Church of England, and charged with defending the Protestant faith by her Coronation Oath.

Meanwhile the Islamic Republic of Iran is, as the name would suggest, officially Islamic, with a religious cleric acting as Supreme Leader.

Conversion from the state religion of Islam to Christianity in Iran is officially deemed as “apostasy” — a criminal offence which is punishable by death.

Why’s HM Gov. taking a deranged (almost sarcastic) approach to life-threatening asylum cases (Muslims face death sentence for apostasy in theocratic Iran) & taking a theological view on Christianity? This has constitutional implications. Imagine making these comments about Islam — Maajid – (Mājid) [maːʤɪd] ماجد (@MaajidNawaz) March 21, 2019

Police have vowed they “will be prosecuting” British truckers who staged a “go slow” protest after the Government broke its promise to deliver Brexit on March 29th and asked the EU to push the date back.

Prime Minister Theresa May had vowed to deliver Brexit on schedule 108 times from the House of Commons despatch box, but reversed position after her proposed Withdrawal Agreement with the European Union was heavily rejected by MPs for a second time.

Rather than allow Brexit to go ahead without a deal on March 29th, she asked the European Council for an extension to the end of June — but received a much shorter one, with Brexit now set to take place on May 22nd if she manages to get her deal past MPs in the coming days, or on No Deal terms on April 12th if she cannot.

Technically, the exit date set down in the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 remains March 29th, with the Government needing to pass a statutory instrument to extend it — although as EU law is superior to national law, most commentators believe this is not really necessary for the agreed dealy to have legal effect.

For Tory Brexiteers still dreaming we leave on no deal March 29: extension agreed and signed off by EU27 is a decision binding in international law. EU law, not domestic law, created the 29th March legal “cliff-edge.” Failure to amend exit date in UK law does not lead to No Deal — Andrew Neil (@afneil) March 23, 2019

Lorry and van drivers with the Brexit Direct Action Group, angry that Mrs May, a former Remain campaigner, had reneged on her oft-repeated promises to deliver Brexit, protested the delay with a “go-slow” on major highways.

The police, however, have responded harshly, vowing that they will prosecute the leading drivers for “inconsiderate driving”.

“My officers… stopped the front vehicles and will be prosecuting them for inconsiderate driving,” declared Inspector Simon Jenkinson, from the Alliance Roads Policing Team.

“We recognise the right to protest and make views clear, but we will not tolerate careless and inconsiderate driving on our roads,” Jenkinson added, somewhat contradictorily.

“We engaged with organisers before the go-slow began, they ignored our advice to stay in lane 1 and limit speed to no less than 45 mph,” he complained.

“We stopped 9 vehicles, the front two have been reported for inconsiderate driving the remainder given words of advice and allowed to continue on their way at an appropriate speed. If they repeat their actions they are aware we have their details and prosecutions will follow.”

Theresa May could survive the palace coup which appeared to be unfolding at breakneck speed on Saturday night, as the Cabinet ministers who were frontrunners to take over as “caretaker” leaders publicly disavow the plot.

Mrs May has clung on through numerous political reverses which seemed certain to bring her down: losing the Tory party’s parliamentary majority in the 2017 snap election; the resignations of Boris Johnson and the inaugural Brexit secretary (and later his successor) over her EU strategy; a vote of no confidence in her as party leader which saw over half her backbenchers back her removal; her government becoming the first in recorded history to be found in Contempt of Parliament; suffering a historic parliamentary defeat when she put her proposed Brexit deal to MPs (twice), and a vote of no confidence in her government by the Opposition.

The latest reported attempt to overthrow her by more than half the Cabinet appeared as though it would deliver the coup de grâce to her premiership, especially after reports that her own whips had told her she was finished — but it may now turn out to be just one more in a long line of failed insurrections.

The coup is dead, by lunchtime (if it ever seriously lived). @michaelgove has done a broadcast clip, as @DLidington has, to denounce the idea of a caretaker PM and deny any involvement in a plot to install one. — Tom Newton Dunn (@tnewtondunn) March 24, 2019

Asked about a leadership coup Michael Gove says "It's not the time to change the captain of the ship – we need to chart the right course" — Alex Forsyth (@AlexForsythBBC) March 24, 2019

For a time it appeared as though it was all over bar the shooting, but squabbles over who should succeed Mrs May as a so-called “caretaker” or interim prime minister may have strangled the plot at birth.

Her de facto deputy, David Lidington, was an early frontrunner — although his former position as Europe minister under David Cameron and reputation as a staunch Remainer rendered him unacceptable to Brexiteers.

Alternative choice Michael Gove, a Brexiteer and leading figure in the Vote Leave campaign during the EU referendum in 2016, was suspected of harbouring long-term leadership ambitions — by all accounts the plotters intended for the “caretaker” to trigger a normal party leadership contest in which they would not stand after breaking the Brexit impasse — and of being willing to agree an ultra-weak form of Brexit in which Britain would remain in the EU Customs Union (or “a” customs union with the bloc) and Single Market regime, which would be unacceptable to Brexiteers.

In fact, a senior source within the European Research Group (ERG) faction of Tory Brexiteers led by Jacob Rees-Mogg appeared to suggest the plot was bogus, commenting: “This stinks of a [10 Downing Street] operation to blackmail us into voting for [Theresa May’s] deal. They’ve threatened us with an election, a soft Brexit, no Brexit, and now they are threatening us with David Lidington or Michael Gove becoming PM.”

The Prime Minister may yet be toppled, and is holding an emergency summit with key Brexiteers at her official countryside retreat of Chequers in the wake of the plot — but for now confident predictions of her imminent demise appear to have been premature.

The number of far-right terror cases the authorities are faced with is “absolutely dwarfed” by the number of cases related to radical Islam, according to Britain’s Security Service, better known as MI5.

MI5 specialises in counter-espionage and domestic security, in contrast to the foreign intelligence-oriented Secret Intelligence Service – better known as SIS or MI6, made famous by Ian Flemming’s James Bond books. The assessment of the relative seriousness of the Islamist terror threat and the far-right terror threat was disclosed halfway through a Guardian report focusing heavily on the latter, later republished by other media outlets including CNN and Microsoft-owned MSN.

The left-liberal newspaper led on claims by the far-left HOPE Not Hate organisation, which describes itself as “anti-fascist” and has previously received funding from billionaire open borders campaigner George Soros, that “huge numbers of Britons are among the global audience for far-right forums” online.

The Guardian also quoted Britain’s anti-extremism “tsar”, Sara Khan, regarding the “frightening amount of legal extremist content online” which the left claim is fuelling far-right extremism. The comments suggest a clampdown on online anonymity and uncensored discussion groups may be on the cards.

New Online Terror Laws ‘Criminalise Thought,’ Says Terror Chief — Risk Jail For Viewing ‘Far Right Propaganda’

https://t.co/mvMzvxPswB — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 25, 2017

Halfway through the article, however, the Guardian concedes that, while the security services “have not revealed how many of the 700 or so live terror plots and 20,000 individuals classified as ‘closed subjects’ … are related to right-wing extremism”, MI5 did disclose that such cases are, quote, “absolutely dwarfed by the number of Islamist cases” being dealt with.

This is the case despite the fact that Britain’s white population, from which white nationalist extremists are presumably likely to recruit, is in excess of 50 million, while the Muslim population, from which Islamist extremists are likely recruiting, is officially only 2.7 million – suggesting the radical Islamism presents a much more potent threat than the far right in terms of its capacity to radicalise people.

Nevertheless, the British authorities have placed a huge degree of emphasis on tackling the far right since even before Christchurch, with Cabinet minister Amber Rudd warning that people viewing what she described as “far-right propaganda” online could face up to 15 years’ imprisonment under harsh new counter-extremist penalties while she was still at the Home Office.

The measures drew some criticism from Max Hill QC, then terrorism legislation watchdog, now Director of Public Prosecutions for England and Wales, who warned that the Government should not “criminalise thought without action or preparation for action,” and that “the struggle for national security must not be used as a stick to beat down the rights we hold dear.”

“If that were to happen, terrorism would have prevailed,” he added.

Far-left Antifa extremists have been blamed for the attack on the the political management school in Lyon founded by French former populist MP Marion Maréchal.

Ms Maréchal said she would be submitting a formal complaint about far-left extremist violence after the attack on her Institute for Social Sciences, Economics, and Politics (ISSEP) occurred late Tuesday night, Le Figaro reports.

A far-left extremist Antifa group named “Anti-fascist group Lyon” took credit for the attack writing on Facebook, “On the night of March 26th to 27th, we attacked ISSEP […] the school created by Marion Maréchal Le Pen which opened new year 2018 in order to form an elite of the far right.”

“Consider this attack as an answer to all racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic acts, as well as deadly anti-migration policies and the Christchurch bombing,” they added in the post which has since been removed.

Maréchal told Le Figaro, “We will use all legal channels to enforce the freedom of education in France, obviously violated by violent leftist militias and whose members are known to police.”

“They think they are free enough to claim their actions on their Facebook page. This is to say their feeling of impunity. In addition to filing a complaint, I will ask for an appointment with the prefect, the rectorate, and the mayor of Lyon to take preventative measures against such threats to the safety of my institution,” she said.

In a press release, the ISSEP said that the Antifa extremists had smashed a window with a hammer, attempted to force locks, and had covered the facade of the building with black paint.

The attack echoes that against the hipster-right Identitarian movement in Halle, Germany, that saw Antifa extremists attempt to break into their building with a drill and spray butyric acid inside. The extremists also set fires and smashed nearby cars.

Earlier this year a party office of the populist Alternative for Germany in Döbeln was firebombed, with many suspecting Antifa being behind the attack.

In Italy, far-left groups have been even more radical with an anarchist group bombing an office of Interior Minister Matteo Salvini’s League party in Treviso in August last year.


Nigel Farage has spoken to the Brexit Betrayal rally taking place in Parliament Square, telling the thousands marchers and campaigners that they were joined in spirit by 17.4 million voters who said that Britain should leave the European Union in 2016.

The Brexit leader spoke at the rally, which was the culmination of a two-week march on London from Sunderland, in North-East England, and told those present that they had been treated with total contempt by the British political class who were working to sign the country up to “a new European Treaty which in many ways is worse than the one we wanted to leave.”

WATCH | @Nigel_Farage: "What they want is to beat us down, for us to give up, for us to go away. Let me tell you, am I today on March 29th downcast? Am I disheartened? NO! I am more determined to fight back than I've ever been in my life!" Support us at https://t.co/iICfFb8qqg pic.twitter.com/dA0C60aj6F — Leave.EU (@LeaveEUOfficial) March 29, 2019

Mr Farage said how glad he was that Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement had been voted down for a third time by Parliament, but said the past two years had been “one of the saddest and worst chapters in the history of our nation.”

Despite the ongoing betrayal of the spirit of the Brexit vote, Mr Farage vowed to fight on and said the attempts to stop Brexit from going ahead had made him more determined than ever.

Mr Farage told the rally, which he joked was meeting in “enemy territory” in Westminster, that:

The British public is more with us now than they’ve ever been… there’s a clear lead for us to leave on the 12th of April with no deal, lets hope and pray that happens. But, I’m sorry to say I fear that the betrayal we have seen over today’s date will probably be repeated on the 12th of April. But let us not be disheartened, I tell you what — if that means we have to fight the European elections on the 23rd of May, let me tell you I will fight them! And if they force us to fight a second referendum, we’ll beat them by a bigger margin. This is about our country, it’s about our nation, it is about our democracy, it is about who we are, as a people. What we stand for, what those who came before us sacrificed. It’s about our children, grandchildren, growing up being proud to be British.

“I can’t think of any time in history, where a greater betrayal of a democratic vote has ever happened in the Western world, and they can tonight over there content themselves because they think they’re winning. But that’s because they live in the Westminster bubble,” Farage continied.

We’re the real people of this country, and we know that the referendum was the first of many great victories. We will get our country back, we will get out independence back, we will get out pride and self-respect back. We are going to win!

While Britain’s overwhelmingly pro-Remain Houses of Parliament will continue working next week to prevent the United Kingdom leaving the European Union, Breitbart London reported today that the European Union is publicly saying that a full, no-deal Brexit is moving nearer.

The European Commission said this afternoon that in light of today’s vote, “a ‘no deal’ on 12 April is now a likely scenario.”

This will be interpreted as a threat by British politicians — but Brexiteers among the general public may feel like they are being threatened with a good time.

Also speaking at the rally was Labour’s Kate Hoey, a dedicated Brexiteer who has faced the scorn of her fellow party members to support Britain leaving the European Union for years. Addressing the demonstration, Hoey was absolutely scathing of her Parliamentary colleagues and the Speaker of the House, John Bercow, who she said had backed up “every devious method” to frustrate Brexit.

Hoey said: “I feel so distressed and so angry about Parliament… we all remember the wonderful feeling when we woke up and realised that 17.4 million people had voted to leave.

“My 96-year-old mother, who has since passed away, said to me: ‘you know, they will never let us leave’. And I vowed that day, that I would do my very best to make sure the democratic will of the people in this country is respected.”

Warning the attendees of the march and demo that more fights for Brexit certainly lay ahead, Hoey concluded her speech by saying: “The betrayal started the day after we voted to leave… While we are not celebrating leaving tonight, we are celebrating the fightback — and the fightback begins tonight.”


A mosque in central London was sealed off after a man was stabbed to death in the street outside, the latest of a long series of knife crimes in the capital.

Police were called to the scene, Cunningham Place near Regent’s Park, at 6:15pm on Thursday, March 28th, after receiving reports of an attack.

The victim, believed to be a man in his early 20s, was taken to hospital where he later died.

The crime scene included the sealing off of the local London Central Mosque, where it is believed that the attackers fled shortly after. A witness said she saw “two guys” running into the mosque after the stabbing.

A spokesman said officers were currently looking for two attackers who “fled the scene”. Scotland Yard has said the attack is not thought to be terror-related.

London local newspaper the Evening Standard reported Friday that the two suspects used the Mosque to evade capture, and they “washed their faces and feet” before “mingling” with worshippers before leaving in different clothes.

The stabbing comes as London is in the midst of a 40-year high rise in knife crime.

It follows a 15 per cent rise in London knife crime, with 14,987 knife related incidents reported in the city — an average of 41 per day. This represents 38 per cent of all knife crime across England and Wales.

The surge in knife crime is part of a wider rise in crime across the country. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), one in five adults had experienced crime in the year ending June 2018.

The ONS report revealed that “offences involving a knife or a sharp instrument are at the highest level recorded (39,332 offences) since comparable data began to be collected in April 2010”, with offences “concentrated in London and other metropolitan areas”.

As for the background of those involved in the rise in crime, the Evening Standard reports that 73 per cent of offenders and 53 per cent of victims were from a black or minority ethnic background.

Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy previously described the situation by stating that young people are “in the grip” of a “disease”.

Labour MPs and London Mayor Sadiq Khan blame the rise in crime on police cuts by the Conservative government. However, Mr Khan’s administration has so far pushed for greater police resources for online hate crime as well as spending £34 million on ‘green projects’.


Brexiteers have reacted to the failure of the Conservative Party establishment to deliver Brexit on the day the country was scheduled to leave the European Union, warning that if MPs vote to pass Prime Minister Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement it would “simply not be Brexit at all.”

Mrs May has failed on two previous occasions to pass her controversial deal with the EU by large margins. She will bring the treaty portion of the document to the House of Commons for a third time this afternoon.

However, a number of Brexiteer MPs are reportedly preparing to again vote down the deal, which they maintain still fails to deliver Brexit, hands over too many concessions to the EU, and threatens the integrity of the British Union via its Irish backstop.

The United Kingdom’s oldest Conservative think tank, the Bow Group, held a town hall rally on Brexit’s betrayal Thursday night exposing the failures of the Tory Party to deliver on the 2016 referendum, with the group’s chairman Ben Harris-Quinney saying, “Parliament is clearly not representative of the British people, has no intention of delivering the Brexit that was voted for, and the Conservative Party holds considerable blame for this.”

Speaking to a crowd of Brexiteers representing a broad church of conservative thought, Harris-Quinney said, “The establishment desperately wants to distract from the fact that Parliament has ignored the clear instruction of the British people to leave the EU in full on March 29th, 2019.”

Later, speaking exclusively to Breitbart London, the party chairman said, “There is no risk to Brexit in not voting for May’s deal, because to vote for it is to guarantee that Brexit is maligned.”

“It’s not just that Theresa May’s deal is a bad Brexit deal, it is simply not Brexit at all. Anything that keeps us unilaterally tied to EU regulations without the powers to remove ourselves represents a worse scenario than remaining in the EU,” he added.

“The WA isn’t about withdrawal, it's about a prolonged period of staying with all our existing arrangements, without (a place at the table). It puts the UK into an extremely weak position to negotiate the future partnership, and it breaks the Conservative manifesto” @johnredwood pic.twitter.com/LiJgKEzMPL — #StandUp4Brexit (@StandUp4Brexit) March 28, 2019

On the matter of today’s vote in the House of Commons, which if Mrs May’s deal passes will see the United Kingdom agree to a two-year transition period with the EU in which it will retain all its current obligations to the bloc while losing its national representation, the Bow Group said that if “the choice is between Theresa May’s unviable Withdrawal Agreement and a No Deal Brexit” then a Brexit on “[World Trade Organization] terms remains the closest to honouring the Brexit result, and we strongly encourage all conservatives and Brexiteers, in and outside of Parliament, to pursue that course.”

The position is backed by Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, who wrote in The Telegraph on Friday that “the WTO option is the only possible route.”

On Good Morning Britain, Mr Farage said of the failure to deliver Brexit, “I think today is a very disappointing day. This should have been our independence day. The day we became an independent nation. The day we were looking forward [to] for we were promised it.

“I think people have every right to feel betrayed, by the politicians in Parliament and indeed our government for not taking a clear, decisive course.”

Mr Farage attacked Leave-supporting Tory MPs for “turn[ing] tail”, criticising the party as “a Conservative Party in name only.”

“They are putting party before country, career before conscience, and dashing the hopes of millions who want Brexit. Now, as then, I am appalled by their lack of courage,” the Brexit campaigner wrote.

REPORT: May Could Split Withdrawal Agreement to Force Third Vote https://t.co/Q4SWrKDh81 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 28, 2019

Both Vote Leave campaigner Boris Johnson and European Research Group (ERG) chairman Jacob Rees-Mogg have said they will now back the Prime Minister, despite months of Mr Johnson criticising May’s “vassal state” deal, and Mr Rees-Mogg leading the charge for a vote of no confidence in the her leadership some months ago, in the belief that it is now either May’s deal or not Brexit at all.

However, media reports that a number of Brexiteer MPs are still planning to vote down the agreement, with Buzzfeed’s Alex Wickham reporting that there are “Currently 25 ‘definite’ Brexiters who will vote against [the Withdrawal Agreement], per source”.

Former Cabinet minister Owen Paterson, meanwhile, writes in The Telegraph that “I will not vote for an agreement which sees the UK broken up, have laws imposed upon it by a foreign power, subjected to substantial fines for non-compliance, from which there is no unilateral right of exit, and pay £39 billion for the privilege.”

Northern Ireland’s staunchly conservative Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), whose ten MPs prop up the Conservative Party’s minority government, maintains that it will also vote down the Prime Minister’s deal, with Westminster leader Nigel Dodds saying, “We are sticking to our votes on principle.”

One of the most respected figures in British economics has made a last-minute appeal for Brexit sanity, pointing the way forward to a managed no-deal full Brexit while dismissing politicians suffering from collective “nervous breakdown” and project fear claims that do not reflect reality.

Speaking this morning, just hours before the legal deadline that the British prime minister repeatedly promised would be the moment the United Kingdom left the European Union before changing her mind at the last minute, former governor of the Bank of England Mervyn King has called for a full Brexit and for politicians to reject Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement.

The former governor of the Bank of England, Lord King says Britain should leave the EU without a deal and tell the EU it needs time to prepare #r4today https://t.co/nhfnK7I9w8 pic.twitter.com/7aYgSyRHnR — BBC Radio 4 Today (@BBCr4today) March 29, 2019

Lord King, who was governor of the United Kingdom’s central bank between 2003 and 2013, was absolutely scathing of Britain’s political class in his remarks to the BBC, which despite being made on the UK’s state broadcaster’s flagship politics show have been mostly ignored by the British mainstream media, remarking that “incompetence seems to have spread beyond government to Parliament as a whole. The fact they can’t make a decision, is extraordinary.”

Perhaps his harshest criticism was of Parliament’s inability to grasp the reasons why Brexit gained support across the United Kingdom, leaving the respected economist to reflect: “I think that MPs have somehow lost the plot.

“When you hear about people talking about the consequences of leaving without a deal as ‘national suicide’, I wonder whether the political class hasn’t suffered a collective nervous breakdown and lost confidence in the country.”

Britain Should Be ‘Confident’ and Go for Hard Brexit, Says Former Bank of England Governor https://t.co/ADzitm7W5q pic.twitter.com/OKQVa2NV6j — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 26, 2016

Criticising the government’s failure to negotiate with the European Union, and in particular hobbling itself with the unwillingness to keep no deal on the table as a credible option, Lord King said the way forward now was to tell the European Union that the country would be leaving without a deal six months hence — or an amount of time long enough to give the government and business enough time to prepare.

To the clear amazement of BBC interviewer John Humprys, King said:

My own personal preference would be to go back to Europe and say we have a clear strategy which is we want to leave without a deal. But we would like to take six months to complete the preparations to avoid the dislocation… I would like to see us say that we will leave without a deal, a certain distance ahead, which would give the country time to make those preparations and then I think we’d be in a much stronger situation.

Batting back the suggestion from the BBC interviewer that a hard Brexit would lead to job losses, Lord King said:

I don’t think it’s obvious there would be jobs lost at all. If you look at what’s happened since the referendum, we were told there would be a recession if we voted to leave, but what’s actually happened is that the British economy has grown since the referendum by slightly more than Germany. The idea that voting to leave is an economic disaster doesn’t match the facts. If you look at the exchange rates of (£) sterling… it’s exactly the same this week, as when I left the Bank of England in the middle of 2013.

The comments follow others by King in 2018, when he accused an “incompetent” government of delivering a “Brexit in name only”. He said that both the UK and the EU would want a free trade deal, but if Europe was not willing to be reasonable then leaving without a deal would be best for Britain.

On the day when the United Kingdom was supposed to be leaving the European Union, deal or no deal, at 11 p.m., MPs are instead preparing for a third and final vote on Theresa May’s deal with the bloc. What happens next?

Before now, the prime minister had assured Leave voters that “no deal is better than a bad deal” and promised no less than 108 times that the UK would be leaving the EU, come what may, on March 29th 2019.

However, after the Withdrawal Agreement she negotiated with the bloc — allegedly behind the backs of ministers at the Brexiteer-led Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU) — was rejected by Parliament twice, she reversed course, asking the European Council for an extension of the two-year Article 50 exit negotiations commenced in 2017, over the objections of Tory activists and most of her own MPs.

The EU granted the Tory leader a shorter stay of execution than she was asking for, and MPs must vote today for her agreement so Britain can leave the EU under its terms on May 22nd.

If they do not, the country defaults to a No Deal exit on April 12th — although it is widely expected that the Remain-dominated House of Commons would move swiftly to prevent this, instead forcing the Government to request a much longer extension, with or without Mrs May, with the EU reportedly ready to push exit deadline all the way to April Fools’ Day in 2020.

What are the deal’s chances of success?

Mrs May’s deal was rejected by a historic margin when it was first put to MPs in a so-called “meaningful vote”, and by an only slightly less crushing 149 votes on her second attempt.

The Remain-supporting Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, had indicated that it would not be appropriate to put it to MPs for a third time, but it seems ministers have found a way around this by putting the Withdrawal Agreement forward without its accompanying Political Declaration, which technically means it is not a third meaningful vote, or MV3.

The Tories lost their overall majority in the House of Commons in 2017, however, requiring them to look to Northern Ireland’s Brexit-supporting Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) to pass legislation, and affording party hardlines — both Leavers and Remainers — the power to defeat unwanted bills with relative ease if they side with opposition parties.

Up to now, the largely anti-Brexit opposition parties, hardline Tory Brexiteers, hardline Tory Remainers, and the DUP have all opposed the deal — each for their own reasons.

In a Parliament were the vast majority of MPs are Remainers, the prime minister’s hope had been that, faced with the choice between her deal and no Brexit at all, the Tory Brexiteers and DUP would come over and take her over the line.

She has also sweetened the bargain by offering to resign once her deal has passed — and the strategy appears to have borne some fruit, with Brexiteer heavyweights including Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg having indicated they will accept “half a loaf” rather than nothing at all.

The DUP, however, remain opposed, as do a hard core of Tory Brexiteers known as “The Spartans” — with little sign that Tory Remainers hope that blocking the deal will be a stepping stone to blocking Brexit entirely have been won over, either.

In short, the parliamentary arithmetic does not look good for the Prime Minister.

DUP isn’t budging. Some ERG MPs are but not enough. Nor are Labour MPs. MV2.5 will fall tomorrow and so will a May 22 Brexit. The UK will leave the EU on April 12 without a deal unless the Commons swallows a long extension and a big political event – soft Brexit, GE, referendum. — Adam Payne (@adampayne26) March 28, 2019

What happens if the deal does pass?

If the deal does make it through the House of Commons somehow, it is likely that the United Kingdom will leave the EU under its terms on May 22nd — at least in name.

Britain would not participate in the European Parliament elections in May, and would lose its MEPs and European Council representation, but would remain an EU member in all other respects until the end of a so-called “transition period” in which negotiations between the British government — under new leadership, assuming Mrs May keeps her promise to stand down — and Brussels.

If no future partnership is agreed during this transition, which could last all the way to the end of December 2022, the deal makes provisions for the so-called “backstop” to come into force, with Great Britain (England, Scotland, and Wales) being incorporated into an EU-controlled “single customs territory”, while Northern Ireland would be effectively annexed into the EU Customs Union and Single Market proper.

This is considered an unacceptable outcome by virtually all sides of the Brexit debate, and the deal does not allow for Britain to break the arrangement without the EU’s permission — leading to fears that Remainers will simply reopen the question of whether the UK should simply revert seamlessly to full EU membership once the transition is over.

Do we know what will happen next if the deal does not pass?

Legally, the United Kingdom should simply leave the EU cleanly on April 12th on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms if the deal does not pass — otherwise known as a “No Deal” or “Hard” Brexit.

However, this was also supposed to be the cast for March 29th, and the British government, Parliament, and European Union instead contrived for Brexit to be delayed.

It is expected that the same thing will happen if the deal fails today, with the overwhelming majority of MPs voting to reject a No Deal Brexit in a series of “indicative votes”.

However, MPs also voted against every other alternative, including pushing for an even weaker form of Brexit, holding another referendum, and revoking Article 50 — which would essentially cancel the Brexit process.

This leaves the country in an invidious position, where a Leave-supporting populace is served by a Remain-supporting Parliament which has voted against every available Brexit, and where no party commands an overall majority.

A long extension, as the EU has been pushing for with increasing confidence, seems to be the inevitable outcome, assuming the bloc itself does not force a No Deal — as some Brexiteers have been hoping.

This would likely mean Britain would have to participate in the European Parliament elections in May — an event which could serve as something of a proxy second referendum, with parties opposed to Brexit facing off against Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party and Gerard Batten’s UKIP — and a British general election, in which the Tories would likely be under new management.

What strategy for Brexit the Leaver-backed but Remainer-led party would be putting to the people at such an election, however, is unclear.

No majority for anything in Parliament, but there is a majority in the country to leave the EU. Our politicians must stop trying to undo our vote or face a massive backlash from voters. — Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) March 27, 2019

March 28 (UPI) — A fourth victim injured in a shooting aboard a tram in Utrecht, Netherlands, last week died Thursday, the Dutch Public Prosecutor’s Office said.

Officials said the 74-year-old man from De Meern died from his injuries, though declined to reveal the cause of death.

The man was injured March 18 when a gunman opened fire on a tram at the 24 October Square station before leading police on an hours-long manhunt across the city. Turkish national Gokmen Tanis, 37, confessed to the shooting and said he acted alone.

Police said they found a letter in a getaway car he used that makes them believe the shooting was a terror attack.

Prosecutors said Tanis now faces four counts of murder with terroristic objective.

In addition to the 74-year-old man, the dead include a 19-year-old woman, a 28-year-old man and a 49-year-old man. Prosecutors said one of the two seriously injured victims was in the hospital as of Thursday.

Investigators said it doesn’t appear the gunman knew any of the victims.


Now that she has said she is going, people have started to say nice things about Theresa May.

Here, doing an absolutely heroic job in the Daily Mail, is my friend Sarah Vine:

Mrs May is, of course, the daughter of a vicar — and there is something of the scriptures about her decision to make the ultimate sacrifice. It speaks of a deep sense of conviction, of a solid moral compass not often glimpsed in public life. I certainly can’t remember a time when a political leader displayed such courage and selfless sense of duty. Not despite being a woman, but — I suspect — because of it.

And here is probably the best political commentator in the business, the Sun’s Trevor Kavanagh:

Even her staunchest critics will give her credit for her diligent sense of duty, endurance in adversity, her triumph over daunting ill-health and her stubborn determination to deliver what she saw as the will of the people.

There will be lots more in this vein in the run-up to Theresa May’s forced retirement, whenever that may be, sooner rather than later I hope. No one will mean it. It’s just a convention, traditionally observed across the mainstream media, that when a senior political figure retires no one can find a bad word to say about them.

But it’s OK. If you don’t want to read anything nice about Theresa May, consider this your safe space.

I was never a fan. You’ll remember that when Theresa May came to power I instantly wrote a piece headlined Better a Cocker Spaniel as Prime Minister than Theresa May. [I’m like Cassandra — blessed with the ability to predict the future accurately, cursed never to be taken seriously.]

Since then, though, my opinion of the useless, stubborn, devious, and, yes, nebulous old bint has plummeted considerably.

The only debate about Theresa May’s premiership is not whether she was bad. But whether she was actually the worst Prime Minister ever. Or merely one of the worst.

She will go down in infamy for three main reasons.

First, throwing away her Commons majority by holding a General Election on a manifesto so dismal, unconvincing, and resolutely unConservative that some people just thought “sod it” and voted for Jeremy Corbyn instead.

Second, destroying Brexit (because she’s a Remainer and never got the point of it).

Third — an inevitable consequence of the second — splitting the Conservative Party more dangerously than at any time since the repeal of the Corn Laws, and thus, potentially ushering in the most left-wing government in British history.

These are crimes against the British people which can never be forgiven — nor should they be.

Theresa May has been an absolute disaster. And her failure has been a direct consequence of her character.

She’s not very bright (sorry Geographers, but it’s a thicko’s subject); she’s also uncommunicative, bone-headedly stubborn, with an unpleasant authoritarian streak and little ideological grasp of what it means to be a conservative.

God knows why she ever imagined she’d make a decent Conservative prime minister. But she obviously fancied that she did because according to Trevor Kavanagh, who surely must know:

This is the job she fought for with astonishing tenacity all her adult life.

Well, I don’t know about you, but there are quite a few jobs I would personally have liked to have tried in my life: guitarist with Led Zeppelin; body double for John “King Dong” Holmes; President of the USA; superstar DJ; SAS troop commander; hedge fund billionaire.

But what held me back was my realisation that, for various reasons, I wasn’t remotely suited to succeeding at any of them.

Theresa May appears never to have submitted herself to such a reality check.

She’s a bit like the passenger of a stricken jet airliner who offers to take over the controls after the pilot and co-pilot have been taken ill. But who forgets to mention that she doesn’t actually know how to fly.

No, Theresa. It really isn’t an impressive achievement to get to the position of Prime Minister if you are completely unsuited to the job. It’s not a sign of bravery, or determination, regardless of whether or not you’re suffering from a debilitating medical condition (diabetes). Rather it’s a sign that you are so selfish and dim and thoughtless that you put your frivolous political ambitions before the interests of the people you are supposed to serve; and because — inevitably given your character flaws — you destroyed your party, killed Brexit, and plunged Britain into turmoil in a way that almost no other Prime Minister could have done because almost no other Prime Minister could have been as utterly useless.

That’s why people hate you. And rightly so. Good riddance Theresa, if you ever decide to go. Which, knowing you, may yet be a very long time hence.


The Czech Republic’s right-populist president Andrej Babiš has criticised the cost for host nations to hold the rotating Council of the European Union — one of seven presidents of the bloc.

The Central European country is set to take up the six-month presidency in the second half of 2022, with Politico.eu reporting that local media claims Mr Babiš made the comments during a Cabinet meeting this week.

While the premier — a wealthy businessman occasionally dubbed the Czech Trump — denied that his country would be pulling out of the rotating presidency, he did say that the considerable cost to holding the position for the Czech Republic would bring little benefit to the nation in return.

According to Czech daily Deník N, the last time the country held the presidency in 2009 it cost the country 3.5 billion Czech koruna (£116 million/$152m/€135m).

The European Union has been criticised for its perceived wasting of Europeans’ money on needless bureaucratic agencies.

The Council of the European Union is the voice of EU member governments, comprised of government ministers from each EU country. Its current national president is Romania.

That is not to be confused with the European Council — which is comprised of the heads of state of governments of EU countries, presided over by Donald Tusk.

There is also the European Commission, the unelected executive arm of the EU headed by Jean-Claude Juncker.

Antonio Tajani is the President of the European Parliament, comprised of Members of European Parliament (like Nigel Farage MEP) elected by regions across Europe. The EP has not one but two chambers — one in Strasbourg, France, and one in the EU capital Brussels, Belgium, and MEPs travel between the two. The Parliament’s Secretariat (its staff) are based in a third country: Luxembourg.

Those are the presidencies of the EU that readers may be familiar with. There are three others: President of the European Central Bank Mario Draghi, President of the Court of Justice Koen Lenaerts, and President of the European Court of Auditors Klaus-Heiner Lehne.


The leading candidate for the European People’s Party (EPP) Manfred Weber has demanded the European Union stop giving money to populist eurosceptic parties, arguing many want to destroy the political bloc.

Mr Weber said that parties which set themselves against the European Union should not receive any form of financial support from it, naming French populist leader Marine Le Pen and the Alternative for Germany (AfD) specifically, Die Welt reports.

“European parties whose goal is to destroy the European Union, such as the right-wing extremists of Le Pen or even large parts of the AfD, should in the future receive no more money from European pots,” Weber said.

While he claimed that politicians should be allowed to critique the political bloc he added, “There is no institution in the world that is so naive to finance their own opponents. These anti-EU factions are using EU taxpayers’ money to pay for election campaigns, actions, and posters aimed at abolishing the EU.”

Weber also said that countries outside of the European Union should not be allowed to fund or loan money to political parties. Russian banks, for example, loaned money to Marine Le Pen in 2014 after French banks refused to loan her party money for her campaign.

EU to Cut Funds to Patriotic Nations, Allocate Cash on ‘Values’ Basis, Including Accepting Mass Migration https://t.co/DWaaMIoIGS — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 24, 2018

“It is disturbing and frightening that we have parties in Europe that can be influenced by injecting money from third countries in their policies,” Weber said and added, “Ultimately, however, we must legally prohibit European parties from obtaining any form of party funding from outside the EU.”

The proposal comes after the EPP voted to suspend the membership of Hungary’s Fidesz led by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán after complaints that one of Fidesz’s campaigns was “anti-EU.”

“The EPP is a party family which tries to keep together liberal, left-wing parties and Christian conservative parties like us. In the recent weeks the left side of this big and colourful community called for the expulsion of the right side to turn its direction to the left,” Orbán said in response to the suspension.

Weber’s idea also follows a proposal of the European Commission last year which recommended cutting off cash to member states which did not live up to “EU values” which include migration, environmental policy, and youth unemployment.


The European Union has reportedly offered April Fools’ Day 2020 as a new Brexit date should Theresa May’s deal fail to succeed on a mooted third attempt to get it through Parliament, assuming Remain MPs move to stop a No Deal on exit on April 12th.

Brexit was originally scheduled to take place on Friday, March 29th, with or without a deal, but the Prime Minister has now delayed it in concert with the European Council — despite promising she would not do so 108 times, and her own MPs and party National Convention voting against it — so it will either take place on May 22nd if her deal is approved by Parliament, or April 12th on No Deal terms if it is not.

It is widely expected that the Remainer-dominated House of Commons will not allow No Deal to take place on April 12th whatever happens to the deal, however, and reports indicate that should they seek a long extension of the Article 50 negotiating period to find a new way forward — likely via a second referendum or a general election acting as a proxy for one — the EU will offer April Fools’ Day 2020 as the new deadline.

BREAKING: May Offers Resignation to Get Brexit ‘Worst Deal in History’ Over the Line https://t.co/rdhQhvfcn8 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 27, 2019

The situation in Parliament is developing rapidly, but at present it looks as though Mrs May will attempt to hold a thinly disguised third so-called “meaningful vote” on her deal tomorrow, as downhearted Brexiteers who have previously denounced it and even sacrificed ministerial positions to attack it say they will now back it, provided she resigns once the deed is done.

One of these is the former Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, Boris Johnson, although in a House of Commons where the Tory party does not command an outright majority on its own even his defection seems unlikely to get Mrs May over the line.

“It’s dead anyway,” the two-time Mayor of London, who remains a potential leadership favourite among Tory activists, if not parliamentary colleagues, is said to have told friends.

Northern Ireland’s Brexit-supporting Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), true to their reputation as gritty negotiators, have already made it clear they will still not back the deal — potentially a mortal blow to its prospects, given it is only with the DUP’s help that the Tories can command a slim parliamentary majority.

And, despite Johnson and other leading Tory Brexiteers such as Jacob Rees-Mogg having said he will now back the deal for what he believes to be pragmatic reasons, rather than any real enthusiasm, a hard core of European Research Group (ERG) members who have become known as “The Spartans” have said they will never back it.

“I told my whip the other day I wouldn’t vote for it if they put a shotgun in my mouth,” the group’s characteristically pugnacious vice chairman, Mark Francois MP, told the BBC defiantly.

Steve Baker MP, the straight-laced former Brexit minister, who has been more forthcoming than any of the Brexiteer MPs who have resigned from Mrs May’s government about the way she and the bureaucrats assisting her have deliberately sabotaged the Brexit negotiations — in a manner he described as an abuse of the constitution — was if anything even more pugnacious.

“What is our liberty for if not to govern ourselves?” Baker demanded in an impassioned speech at an ERG meeting.

“I could tear this place down and bulldoze it into the river,” he said of the Houses of Parliament.

“These fools and knaves and cowards are voting on things they don’t even understand.”

“We’ve been put in this place by people whose addiction to power without responsibility has led them to put the choice of No Brexit or this deal,” he railed.

“I may yet resign the whip [as a Tory MP] than be part of this.”

European Parliament’s Liberals have promised to tear down walls, in an EU election campaign video depicting the group’s leader smashing through a border fence with his head.

“Europe’s future” rests on this May’s EU Parliament elections, and the choice voters will be given of either between “destroying” the bloc or “reforming” it, according to a new Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) campaign video.

Declaring the elections a battle between“destroying” the bloc or “reforming” it, ALDE says “the choice is clear”, before graphics depicting the group’s leader, Guy Verhofstadt, breaking through a barbed wire-topped border wall with an enormous representation of his head, bursting onto the screen accompanying a promise to ‘tear walls down’ rather than build them.

“Europe is NOT the problem. It is the solution,” declares the video, which features cartoon hands grabbing at the EU flag.

Verhofstadt’s very public loathing of Hungary’s patriotic government, which slashed illegal immigration by more than 99 per cent after building a series of powerful border fences, was also apparent elsewhere in the video.

ALDE uses a photograph appearing to show far left protesters, along with newspaper headlines lambasting Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán as an “autocrat”, to represent a choice between “weakening freedom” and “strengthening” it at the elections.

Brexit pioneer Nigel Farage — another bête noire of the Belgian MEP, whose claims to represent freedom were contradicted somewhat by his recent calls for EU-wide censorship to purge the internet of so-called “hate” — also featured in the video, alongside flashing images of a motorway and a set of masked protesters, to represent the option of ‘destroying’ Europe.

ALDE is expected to soon announce it will be partnering with the party of France’s arch-globalist leader, Emmanuel Macron, for EU elections, according to the Parliament magazine, which reported this week how Verhofstadt went on the warpath against Europe’s so-called centre-right European People’s Party (EPP) bloc for its decision to only suspend, rather than expel from its ranks, Hungary’s populist ruling party, Fidesz.

The 65-year-old veteran Eurocrat, who recently called for Europe and Africa to be merged into “a single Euro-African economic area … of 1.5 billion consumers”, appeared in September to suggest that the U.S should invade or otherwise force regime change on Hungary, declaring the country’s democratically elected government a “threat to the rules-based international order”.

In an opinion piece carried by CNN, where he paid tribute to war and regime change enthusiast “the late, great, John McCain”, Verhofstadt called on the “the international community — and the United States in particular” to destroy conservative governments in Europe, insisting: “We need to stop [Orbán] — now”.


BRUSSELS (AP) – NATO has extended the mandate of its top civilian official, Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, for two years, making the former Norwegian premier one of the longest-serving heads of the military alliance.

Stoltenberg said Thursday he is “honored” by the decision made by the 29 allies and “I thank them for putting their trust in me.”

He said: “We face the biggest security challenges in a generation and I look forward to continue working with all allies to adapt and modernize NATO.”

Stoltenberg, who assumed office in 2014, will now hold the post until Sept. 30, 2022.

Only former Dutch foreign minister Joseph Luns, who spent 13 years in office from 1971, will have served in the post longer if Stoltenberg sees out his term.


On Saturday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “AM Joy,” House Intelligence Committee and House Judiciary Committee member Eric Swalwell (D-CA) stated that if Attorney General William Barr will not release the complete, unredacted Mueller report, “we’ll subpoena it.”

Host Joy Reid asked, “If William Barr refuses to release it in full and unredacted, will the Democratic leadership subpoena it? Will Adam Schiff subpoena it?”

Swalwell responded, “Yes. The president is outnumbered now, in that the voters gave us a balance of power over these abuses of power. They gave us that subpoena power this past November. So, we’ll subpoena it. But we’re also confident that, if we have to go to the courts, that, because of the judicial precedent that already exists through the Watergate litigation, that that’s also on our side, too.”

London (AFP) – With the UK parliament rejecting Britain’s EU divorce deal for a third time Friday, the country is faced with the prospect of breaking ties with its closest trading partner without a deal on April 12 — unless EU leaders agree on an alternative.

Here are the main ways Britain would be affected in case of a “no-deal” ending to the 46-year partnership.

– Business planning –

Around 80 percent of British companies judged themselves ready for a “no-deal” exit, according to a Bank of England survey published on March 21, up from 50 percent in an equivalent January survey.

However, it said many companies noted that the potential impact on tariffs, border frictions, exchange rate movements and recognition of certifications “were outside their control”.

In February, the government said just 40,000 of 240,000 businesses that trade only with EU nations had obtained the required customs clearance numbers.

– Trade deals –

Britain will default to “third country” status with the EU, with trade relations run on World Trade Organization rules.

While the EU’s average tariff rate for third countries is low –- around 1.5 percent — they are bigger in certain sectors: for cars, the rate is 10 percent.

Britain will also lose access to major markets covered by EU trade agreements, although it has managed to replicate some of these, including with Switzerland and Israel.

– Border delays –

The EU says it would immediately begin customs checks, food safety inspections and verification of EU standards at its border with Britain, leading to long delays at busy crossing points.

Britain has moved to open up new routes and increase links from other ports to decongest Dover.

The government says it does not expect shortages of food, although there could be a reduction in choice of perishable goods, but MPs have expressed concern about “panic buying”.

– Northern Ireland –

Britain says it would not immediately apply customs checks on the border with EU member Ireland, to avoid raising tensions in the once conflict-ridden province of Northern Ireland.

But the EU says it would insist on monitoring goods moving across what will become the bloc’s external frontier, although it would try to make these the least intrusive possible.

Britain has suggested it may have to reimpose direct rule over Northern Ireland to manage a “no deal” situation, as the devolved government in Belfast has been suspended since January 2017 in a row between the two power-sharing parties.

– EU citizens’ rights –

An estimated 3.5 million European citizens are living in Britain, and around one million Brits are settled elsewhere in the EU.

Britain and many other member states have already offered to protect their rights, although their long-term status would have been more clearly defined in May’s deal.

British citizens travelling to the EU will be limited to 90-day stays and would immediately be subject to tighter passport checks.

– Medicines –

The British government has asked drug companies to stockpile six weeks’ supply of an estimated 7,000 prescription or pharmacy-only drugs that come from the EU.

Ministers say the transportation of medicines will be prioritised and those with short shelf-lives, such as medical radioisotopes, could be flown in.

– Financial services –

Some stop-gap agreements have been reached on both sides including a one-year agreement to protect the derivatives market, which is based in London.

Traders buy these complex but vital financial instruments to insure themselves against sudden interest or currency exchange rate swings.

The EU derivatives market was notionally valued last year at 660 trillion euros ($750 trillion).

– Planes and trains –

The EU has agreed to allow flights from the UK into the other 27 member states to continue until March 2020, if London reciprocates, but airlines might not be able to make intra-EU connections.

Another time-limited deal will allow trucks to keep carrying goods in and out of Britain, provided London gives reciprocal treatment to EU operators.

The high-speed train link through the 50-kilometre (30-mile) Channel Tunnel running between Britain and France will be kept open for three months, as long as Britain adopts EU rail safety standards.

Miami (AFP) – Ashleigh Barty’s transformation is complete after the Australian defeated Czech seventh seed Karolina Pliskova 7-6 (7/1) 6-3 Saturday to win the biggest singles title of her career at the WTA Miami Open.

The 22-year-old Aussie quit tennis five years ago after finding the mental grind of the tour too much to bear, turning to professional cricket in a bid to find sporting happiness.

Barty, however, knew she had the tennis skills to compete at the very top and after returning in February 2016, has taken her career to an elite level, culminating in her first-ever WTA Premier Mandatory title to follow on from the US Open doubles crown she won last September.

Barty, a junior Wimbledon winner at age 15, will rise from 11th to number nine in the world rankings and become the first Australian woman since Sam Stosur in June 2013 to crack the top 10.

“It has been a phenomenal two weeks both in singles and doubles,” said Barty, who lost a women’s doubles semi-final alongside Victoria Azarenka.

Barty hit 15 aces and 41 winners compared to 22 from an out-of-sorts Pliskova.

“I had to keep it physical, make as many balls as possible and keep my running shoes on,” Barty said.

Barty’s victory means that for the first time ever there have been 14 different winners in 14 WTA events so far this season.

Pliskova, who will rise to fourth in the rankings despite a disappointing final, badly struggled with her serve and movement, off the pace mentally and physically after reaching the quarter-finals or better in her five prior tournaments this year.

“I am very tired but Ashleigh came up with the goods today,” Pliskova said.

The 27-year-old Czech came into the final with 31 aces, most in the women’s draw, but she won only 65% of points on her first serve compared to 86% from Barty.

When the Australian double faulted at 1-1 to hand Pliskova an early break, it wasn’t the start Barty sought and more errors in the following game allowed Pliskova to extend her lead.

Barty then began to settle down and crisply struck a forehand winner to breal Pliskova for the first time.

The Aussie started superbly in the tie-breaker, moving 5-1 ahead before Pliskova hit long to seal the set for Barty, who broke early in the second set to signal it would be her day.


EL PASO, Texas, March 30 (UPI) — At a crowded downtown intersection less than a mile from the U.S.-Mexico border, Democrat Beto O’Rourke brought his presidential campaign to his native El Paso, Texas, for the first time.

“Welcome to the beautiful, magical, safe and secure U.S.-Mexico border,” said U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-Texas, as she introduced candidate O’Rourke. “El Paso is the Ellis Island of the border and in Beto O’Rourke we are sending the nation our best.”

The border is at the center of ongoing immigration debate in the United States, Escobar said, praising O’Rourke — known as Beto, the Spanish nickname for Robert — as a “son of the border.”

“We are safe because we are a city of immigrants and asylum seekers,” O’Rourke said in a stump speech lasting 30 minutes. “El Paso represents America at its best.”

Since officially announcing his presidential bid on March 14, O’Rourke has driven almost 2,500 miles to campaign in 8 states: Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada.

But Saturday was the former congressman’s first campaign appearance in Texas. Standing above the enthusiastic El Paso crowd and dressed in a customary button-down blue shirt and gray dress pants, O’Rourke quoted the civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King and promised a campaign focused on respect and unity rather than division and fear.

“Rather than a campaign based on where you live, who you love, or who you voted for in the last elections, before anything else we are Americans first,” O’Rourke told the crowd of several thousand.

O’Rourke promised his campaign would unify Americans on immigration reform, climate change legislation, universal healthcare and equal pay for women. He vowed to defend women’s reproductive rights and to protect U.S. democracy. He did not mention gun control, an issue he has addressed at other rallies.

“Universal healthcare means everyone gets primary healthcare, mental healthcare — and universal care also means that every woman makes her own decisions about her own body,” O’Rourke said.

If he were the next president, O’Rourke said he would sign legislation to protect voting rights, provide families with paid leave and outlaw workplace discrimination. He said he would end the federal prohibition on cannabis and expunge arrest records for a substance now legal in many states. He promised to protect so-called Dreamers, child migrants brought to the United States by their parents under an Obama-era program and who are at risk of deportation. He also said he would confront the legacy of slavery in the United States.

“Let’s confront the true legacy of slavery, of segregation, suppression, of how people have been criminalized & kept down based on their race and ethnicity. Only that truth will allow us to begin to repair the damage done,” he said.

Near the end of his speech, he broke for several minutes into Spanish. It delighted the crowd, who chanted “Si se puede!” in response, meaning, “Yes we can!”

O’Rourke’s call for unity appealed to rallygoer Juan Olivas and his husband, Treo Valdés, both of El Paso.

“We are supporting Beto because he is a voice for change and he will make sure we are united and not divided as a country,” Olivas said. “He is conciliatory and he offers reason and clarity and a strong support for human rights.”

Olivia Guzman, 12, attended the rally with her father, Joel. She said it was important to attend the rally because “this is our future.”

“If Beto wins he could make things better,” Olivia said. “All the issues he is talking about are really important: climate change, gun control, health care, immigration. Beto can change what President Trump is doing.”

O’Rourke only mentioned the president twice in his speech. But he received some of his loudest applause when calling for immigration reform, an issue President Donald Trump made a hallmark of his 2016 campaign.

In his speech, the former 2018 U.S. Senate candidate drew attention to migrant parents and children being held by U.S. Border Patrol in a tent underneath the Paso del Norte bridge linking El Paso to Ciudad Juarez, Mexico.

O’Rourke visited the tent on Friday and posted his reaction on social media. “Kids, moms, and families trapped for days at a time in our name. Will continue pushing for answer so we can put an end to this,” he said.

But not everybody in downtown El Paso on Saturday agreed with O’Rourke’s pro-immigrant status. Before his campaign rally began, a smaller crowd of Trump supporters protested a few blocks away in favor of the president’s agenda.

“Finish the wall,” the protesters cried as they held up banners saying, “Trump-Pence 2020.”


March 30 (UPI) — Honda confirmed the 16th U.S. death related to the rupture of faulty Takata airbag inflators, including two in Ford cars.

The U.S. deaths have included 14 in Honda vehicles and two occurring in Ford vehicles.

The first new death confirmed since 2017 occurred in a 2002 Honda Civic in Arizona in 2018, the Japanese automaker said in a news release Friday.

“The driver killed in this crash, who was the current owner, purchased the vehicle less than three months prior to the incident,” Honda said in a statement. “There is no requirement that sellers, new owners or any other parties inform Honda of a change of ownership, and Honda was not made aware of the ownership change at the time of the crash. Thus, Honda was not able to send any recall notices to the new owner before the tragic event.”

Worldwide, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has reported at least 24 deaths and 300 injuries.

The recall is the largest in U.S. history, involving 19 vehicle manufacturers and approximately 46 million Takata air bag inflators in an estimated 34 million vehicles in the United States alone, the NHTSA said.

Long-term exposure to humidity can break down the propellant in the inflators, which can cause the propellant to burn too quickly and create too much pressure on the inflators, NHTSA data show.

The NHTSA added that “in extreme cases the inflator explodes, shooting shrapnel toward vehicle occupants.”

Automakers urge owners affected by the Takata recall to get their vehicles repaired at authorized dealers as soon as possible, especially older vehicles, which have a higher risk of an airbag inflator rupture.


March 30 (UPI) — Purina has voluntarily recalled some Muse wet cat food, citing complaints of rubber pieces found in cans.

Nestle Purina PetCare Company announced the voluntary recall Thursday.

The recall of Muse wet cat food applies to the Natural Chicken Recipe in Gravy in three-ounce cans.

“The product could contain rubber pieces that are translucent yellow with a blue backing, which may present a potential choking hazard,” the company said in a statement. “We became aware of the issue after receiving complaints from pet owners who observed the rubber pieces in the product.”

“We have made changes to our process so this should not happen in the future,” the company added.

Purina has yet to receive any reports of injury or illness, but said it is conducting the voluntary recall as a precaution.

“We recommend that you discard any of the affected product you may have, and we will replace it,” the company said.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration also posted the recall on its website.


March 30 (UPI) — A federal judge has struck down a pending California law that bans high-capacity gun magazines as unconstitutional.

In 2016, voters approved Proposition 63, which strengthened state gun laws by requiring anyone who owned such magazines to turn them in, remake them to comply with the law or send them out of state. A 2000 law had already made it illegal for Californians to buy or sell magazines that hold more than 10 cartridges.

But in a ruling Friday, San Diego-based U.S. District Judge Roger Benitez wrote the proposition “hits at the center of the Second Amendment and its burden is severe.”

“Individual liberty and freedom are not outmoded concepts,” he wrote in the 86-page decision.

Benitez had issued a statewide injunction against it two days before the legislation’s start date in July 2017.

The proposition was approved after two shooters killed 14 people and wounded 17 in a San Bernardino rampage.

The judge noted mass shootings are “tragic,” but more common crimes sometimes require maximum firepower because “unless a law-abiding individual has a firearm for his or her own defense, the police typically arrive after it is too late. The size limit [on magazines] directly impairs one’s ability to defend one’s self,” he wrote.

State Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement Friday obtained by the San Francisco Chronicle that “we are committed to defending California’s common sense gun laws — we are reviewing the decision and will evaluate next steps.”

The ruling can be appealed to the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which has upheld gun-control laws. The next level is the U.S. Supreme Court.

Chuck Michel, president of the California Rifle & Pistol Association, filed the suit along with several gun owners.

The National Rifle Association applauded the decision.

Chris W. Cox, the executive director of the NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action, said the ruling was “huge win for gun owners” and a “landmark recognition of what courts have too often treated as a disfavored right.”

“Judge Benitez took the Second Amendment seriously and came to the conclusion required by the Constitution,” Cox said. “The same should be true of any court analyzing a ban on a class of arms law-abiding Americans commonly possess for self-defense or other lawful purposes.”

The Giffords Law Center filed an amicus brief in opposition to the NRA suit.

Ari Freilich, an attorney with the Giffords Law Center, told the Chronicle the ruling was “not unexpected, given who the judge is.”

Benitz is an appointee of Republican President George W. Bush.

The judge didn’t rule on other aspects of the proposition, which includes background checks for ammunition purchases, reporting requirements for lost firearms and new legal procedures for confiscating guns from people prohibited from owning them.


RABAT, Morocco (AP) — The Latest on the Pope’s trip to Morocco (all times local):

7:55 p.m.

Students at a school for Muslim preachers have told Pope Francis and Morocco’s king that they will bring home the lessons of building bridges between religions and promoting a moderate model of Islam.

Nigerian student Hindu Usman told the leaders during Francis’ visit Saturday that she hopes to spread tolerance and peaceful coexistence between Christians, Muslims. She said her country needs advocates to help resolve conflict and misunderstandings.

She said: “Upon my graduation and return home, I will be able to argue and convince that religion is for peace and goodness … that women are equal with men in their rights.”

Although women are unable to become imams, women are trained in the Mohammed VI Institute and graduate with the title of female preachers so they can give lessons on the values of moderate Islam to female mosque-goers.

The institute receives students from all over Europe and Africa.

7:20 p.m.

Pope Francis is telling a group of migrants seeking protection in Morocco that they are “at the center of the church’s heart,” not on its margins, and deserve to welcomed, cared for and integrated into their new homes.

Francis denounced the “merchants of human flesh” who traffic in desperation and called for greater legal channels for migration during a visit to a Catholic charity caring for the migrants who have flocked to Morocco seeking passage to Europe.

And he said all migrants, regardless of their legal status, deserved protection, particularly the most vulnerable children and women. The pope told them “you are not the marginalized. You are at the center of the church’s heart.”

Morocco last year became the main destination for sub-Saharan African migrants seeking to reach Europe via Spain.

6 p.m.

Pope Francis and Moroccan King Mohammed VI are calling for Jerusalem to be preserved as a symbol of peaceful coexistence and for Muslims, Jews and Christians to be allowed to worship there freely.

The two leaders issued a joint appeal on Saturday as Francis arrived in the Moroccan capital Rabat for an overnight visit.

The appeal said it was important to preserve the Holy City “as the common patrimony of humanity and especially the followers of the three monotheistic religions, as a place of encounter and as a symbol of peaceful coexistence, where mutual respect and dialogue can be cultivated.”

Tensions erupted in late February over Israel’s closure of a building at a flashpoint Jerusalem holy site, revered by Jews as the Temple Mount and by Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary.

The walled compound, home to the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the golden Dome of the Rock, is the third-holiest site in Islam and the holiest site of Judaism.

5:15 p.m.

Morocco’s King Mohammed VI is calling for more religious dialogue between Muslims and Christians and says education is the answer to religious extremism.

Greeting Pope Francis on the pontiff’s first visit to Morocco on Saturday, the king said challenging times are facing the world’s religious community and require dialogue “for the sake of the future and that of the coming generations.”

Reading segments of his speech in Arabic, French, Spanish and English, the king said: “We need to tackle these new ills, which feed on treachery as much as on the instrumentalization of the divine message. What all terrorists have in common is not religion but rather ignorance of religion.”

Morocco has sought to become a voice of moderate Islam in the Muslim world.

5 p.m.

Pope Francis is urging Morocco to continue offering migrants welcome and protection, saying at the start of a visit to the North African kingdom that the global migration crisis cannot be resolved by building walls, spreading fear or denying aid.

Francis arrived Saturday in Rabat, the capital of Morocco, which last year became the main destination for sub-Saharan African migrants seeking to reach Europe.

In a speech at the Hassan Tour complex, where two of Morocco’s monarchs are buried, Francis told King Mohamed VI and government officials that he hoped Morocco would continue to be a model of humanity, welcome and protection for migrants seeking a better life.

He said: “The issue of migration will never be resolved by raising barriers, fomenting fear of others or denying assistance to those who legitimately aspire to a better life for themselves and their families.”

4:30 p.m.

Moroccan security agents have tackled a man who broke though security and ran toward King Mohammed VI as he and Pope Francis greeted crowds during an in-tandem motorcade parade in the Moroccan capital.

The man didn’t reach the king, who seemed not to notice the disturbance on Saturday. The man appeared to be waving an envelope as he tried to snake his way between the motorcade vehicles before being tackled. His fate was unknown.

The incident occurred as the king was escorting Francis to the Hassan Tower complex for a formal welcome ceremony.

Francis is in Morocco for a quick trip to boost Christian-Muslim ties and show solidarity with the country’s growing migrant community.

Pope Francis is praising Morocco’s efforts to promote an Islam that repudiates extremism as he opens a quick trip to the North African kingdom that has tried to distinguish itself as a beacon of religious tolerance and moderation in the Muslim world.

King Mohamed VI welcomed Francis on Saturday as the pope began a visit aimed at encouraging Christian-Muslim ties and showing solidarity with Morocco’s ever-growing migrant community.

In a speech to the king and Moroccan authorities at the Hassan Tower complex, Francis said it was “essential” for all believers to counter religious fanaticism and extremism with solidarity. He called religious extremism “an offense against religion and against God himself.”

Later Saturday Francis is heading to a migrant welcome center run by the Caritas Catholic charity.

Pope Francis has arrived in Morocco for a trip aimed at highlighting the North African nation’s tradition of Christian-Muslim ties, while also letting him show solidarity with migrants at Europe’s door and tend to a tiny Catholic flock.

Francis will address the first two items Saturday, and the third when he wraps up the visit with a Mass and a meeting with Moroccan clergy on Sunday.

Moroccan King Mohammed VI was on hand to greet Francis when he landed under a pouring rain in Rabat, the Moroccan capital, for a 27-hour visit.

The highlight of the trip is likely to be Francis’ visit Saturday to the Mohammed VI Institute, a school of learning for imams that epitomizes Morocco’s efforts to promote a moderate brand of Islam and export it via preachers to Africa, the Middle East and Europe.

Pope Francis’s weekend trip to Morocco aims to highlight the North African nation’s tradition of Christian-Muslim ties while also letting him show solidarity with migrants at Europe’s door and tend to a tiny Catholic flock on the peripheries.

Francis will address the first two items on the agenda Saturday when he begins his 27-hour visit to Rabat, the Moroccan capital. He’ll tend to the third when he wraps up the visit with a Mass and a meeting with Moroccan clergy on Sunday.

The highlight of the trip is likely to be Francis’ visit Saturday to the Mohammed VI Institute, a school of learning for imams that epitomizes Morocco’s efforts to promote a moderate brand of Islam and export it via preachers to Africa, the Middle East and Europe.

Morocco, a Sunni Muslim kingdom of 36 million, reformed its religious policies and education to limit the spread of fundamentalism in 2004, following terrorist bombings in Casablanca that killed 43 people.


BEIRA, Mozambique (AP) — Cholera cases among cyclone survivors in Mozambique have jumped to 271, authorities said, a figure that nearly doubled from the previous day.

The Portuguese news agency Lusa cited national health director Ussein Isse, who declared the outbreak of the acute diarrheal disease on Wednesday with just five cases.

So far no cholera deaths have been confirmed, the report said. Another Lusa report said the death toll in central Mozambique from the cyclone that hit on March 14 had inched up to 501. Authorities have warned the toll is highly preliminary as flood waters recede and reveal more bodies.

The cholera cases have been discovered in the port city of Beira, whose half-million residents and especially those in crowded, poor neighborhoods are at particular risk.

Children and other patients curled up on bare beds at a treatment center in Beira on Saturday, some with anxious parents by their side. They had intravenous drips to help replace fluids.

Doctors Without Borders has said it is seeing some 200 likely cholera cases per day in the city, where relief workers are hurrying to restore the damaged water system and bring in additional medical assistance.

The World Health Organization has said some 900,000 cholera vaccine doses are expected to arrive on Monday, with a vaccination campaign starting later in the week.

Cholera is spread by contaminated food and water and can kill within hours if not treated. The disease is a major concern for the hundreds of thousands of cyclone survivors in the southern African nation now living in squalid conditions in camps, schools or damaged homes. Some drink from contaminated wells or filthy, stagnant water.

As health responders stress the need for better disease surveillance, the United Nations’ deputy humanitarian coordinator in Mozambique, Sebastian Rhodes Stampa, has said all cases of diarrhea are being treated as though they are cholera.

Cholera is endemic to the region, and “it breaks out fast and it travels extremely fast,” he told reporters on Friday.

Doctors Without Borders has said other suspected cholera cases have been reported outside Beira in the badly hit areas of Buzi, Tica and Nhamathanda but the chance of spread in rural areas is smaller because people are more dispersed.

Mozambican officials have said Cyclone Idai destroyed more than 50 health centers in the region, complicating response efforts.

The cyclone also killed at least 259 people in Zimbabwe and 56 in Malawi.

The United Nations has said some 1.8 million people need urgent help across the sodden, largely rural region.

Shenzhen (China) (AFP) – Chinese telecom giant Huawei vowed on Friday to “shake off outside distractions” as it announced that its telecom infrastructure business contracted slightly in 2018 amid a global US campaign to blacklist the company over espionage fears.

Huawei said net profit rose to 59.3 billion yuan ($8.8 billion) last year, up 25 percent.

But its carrier business, which supplies telecom infrastructure to much of the world, posted a rare decline, suggesting that the US pressure could be having an impact.

The company’s carrier business was down 1.3 percent on the year, compared to growth of 2.5 percent in 2017 and annual increases typically in excess of 20 percent in years past.

Huawei is the leading manufacturer of equipment for next-generation 5G mobile networks that will bring near-instantaneous connectivity for smartphones, but faces pushback in some Western markets over fears Beijing could gain access to critical infrastructure.

“Security concerns are having an impact on Huawei, as more and more countries place restrictions on the firm’s network gear,” said Brock Silvers, managing director of Kaiyuan Capital.

“Moreover, the US-led global movement has only just begun and is unlikely to quickly recede even in the event of a trade war agreement.”

Huawei’s annual report, released at corporate headquarters in the southern city of Shenzhen, did not detail what caused the carrier business decline or make clear reference to the global pressure.

But the company vowed to press ahead.

“Moving forward, we will do everything we can to shake off outside distractions, improve management and make progress towards our strategic goals,” rotating chairman Guo Ping said.

Huawei also is grappling with the December arrest by Canada of chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou, daughter of company founder Ren Zhengfei, on US charges that she and Huawei circumvented sanctions against Iran.

Two affiliates also were charged this year with stealing trade secrets from telecom group T-Mobile in a separate case.

– ‘No risks’ –

Guo reiterated Huawei’s insistence that it poses no security risk and sought to play up the company’s trustworthiness.

“No government or any third party holds shares in our company or intervenes in our operations and decision-making,” he said.

He also hinted that Huawei’s market dominance made it a crucial player in the global 5G rollout that could not be sidelined.

“We are confident that the companies that choose to work with Huawei will be the most competitive in the 5G era,” he said.

“Countries that choose to work with Huawei will gain an advantage for the next wave of growth in the digital economy.”

He said Huawei signed more than 30 commercial contracts for 5G in 2018 and shipped more than 40,000 5G base stations to markets around the world.

Overall revenue grew 19.5 percent while sales in Huawei’s consumer business, consisting largely of smartphones, surged 45 percent.

Huawei hit back at Washington earlier this month by suing the United States over a law barring US government agencies from engaging with Huawei or with third parties that use the company’s products, which has crippled Huawei in that lucrative market.

Washington has long considered Huawei a potential threat due to the background of founder Ren, a former Chinese army engineer.

Those concerns have escalated as Huawei has risen to become the world leader in telecom networking equipment and one of the top smartphone manufacturers alongside Samsung and Apple.

Huawei has vowed to never allow security “backdoors” in its products which could be used for espionage or sabotage, and insists Washington has never produced evidence substantiating claims of security risks.

Huawei’s annual report mentioned the US legal troubles only in vague terms under the heading “Contingent Liabilities”.


Zagreb (AFP) – Around 300 people from around the Balkans joined Croatia’s first-ever transgender march Saturday to draw attention to the discrimination they face in the largely conservative region.

Blowing whistles and playing drums, the demonstrators walked through downtown Zagreb escorted by special police.

“Change your hearts not my parts” and “Trans lives matter” read banners carried by the marchers.

In a statement earlier, the march organisers warned that the region was facing a “rise of right-wing, fascist groups, which almost always focus their attacks on marginalised people” including women, migrants and trans persons.

The march was intended to send “clear messages of pride and defiance, a revolt against those who try to claim dominion over our bodies, minds and lives, as well as against all forms of oppression,” they said in a statement.

“Solidarity is key. We all need it,” Evan, a 30-year-old trans activist from the Slovenian capital Ljubljana, told AFP.

“It’s also very emotional experience because it’s all of the Balkans coming together.”

Croatia, a European Union state since 2013, has seen a gradual liberalisation of gay rights in recent years. Homosexual couples have been able to register as “life partners” since 2014.

The law granted them the same rights as heterosexual married couples on matters such as property, inheritance, tax, health and social insurance.

Despite these changes however, gay and transgender communities are still exposed to threats or forced underground in Croatia and other Balkan countries.


Johannesburg (AFP) – Super Rugby’s leading points scorer Handre Pollard slotted a 79th-minute penalty Saturday to secure a 19-16 away win for the Bulls over the Sharks in an error-riddled South African showdown.

The penalty was awarded after a scrum close to the Sharks’ 22-metre line in which the home side had the put-in only to be shoved backwards.

Springbok fly-half Pollard also kicked four penalties for a 14-point match total and 96 for the season, 32 more than second-place Hayden Parker from the Tokyo-based Sunwolves.

Jesse Kriel with a try was the other scorer for the Bulls as they put a 36-point thrashing by the Chiefs in Pretoria last weekend behind them after leading 6-3 at half-time.

The result confirmed the dominance of the Bulls over the Sharks with eight victories and a draw from the last nine matches between them in the southern hemisphere competition.

But the outcome in Durban spoilt a special day for Sharks and Springbok prop Tendai Mtawarira, who made a record-equalling 156th Super Rugby appearance for a South African.

The record was held by retired Bulls hooker Adriaan Strauss and Mtawarira, popularly known as ‘The Beast’, can break it next Friday when the Sharks play the Lions in Johannesburg.

It was also a sad day for veteran Bulls hooker Schalk Brits, who was sent off for the first time in a 17-year senior career spanning South African and English clubs.

He was red-carded, along with rival hooker Akker van der Merwe, after they exchanged punches following a maul 17 minutes into the second half.

While Pollard boasted a five-from-five goal-kicking record, Sharks fly-half Robert du Preez succeeded with only two of his five attempts.

Du Preez kicked two penalties and his younger brother, No. 8 Daniel, and centre Andre Esterhuizen scored a try each for the Durban outfit.

The game will be a candidate for the worst Super Rugby match of the season with endless stoppages owing to handling errors and foul play in hot, humid conditions.

The victory placed three-time champions the Bulls fifth in the combined standings, seven points behind leaders and title-holders the Crusaders.

Sharks are one place and one point below the Bulls, but two home defeats already this season against South African rivals could come back to haunt them.

“We could have won this match — we had sufficient scoring opportunities to do so,” admitted Sharks centre and official man-of-the-match Lukhanyo Am.


Paris (AFP) – Mario Balotelli scored two early first-half goals but Marseille were still pegged back in a 2-2 draw against Angers as the French giants’ hopes of making the Champions League suffered a setback on Saturday.

Balotelli, overlooked for Italian international duty in midweek, took his season’s Ligue 1 goal tally to seven.

But two second-half penalties gave Angers a share of the points which left Marseille in fourth spot and eight points off the Champions League spots.

Balotelli opened the scoring after just four minutes although Angers claimed the striker had fouled a defender in the build-up.

His second goal followed just after the quarter-hour mark with a smart finish past Ludovic Butelle in the Angers goal.

Marseille, however, could not hang on as Thomas Mangani converted two penalties in the 36th and 76th minutes.


Aleppo (Syria) (AFP) – Armenians in Syria’s war-torn Aleppo packed their Forty Martyrs Cathedral Saturday for the first mass in the centuries-old church since its restoration began more than a year ago.

Established in the 14th century, it is among the oldest active Armenian churches in Aleppo, a northern Syrian city battered by four years of fighting between rebels and government forces.

After rebels first overran the city in mid-2012, its Christian quarter, housing the church, became one of the city’s most notorious front lines.

In April 2015, parts of the church’s walls, its courtyards, and its entrance were damaged during shelling.

However, it has been gradually restored since Damascus reasserted its control over Syria’s second city in 2016.

State news agency SANA says the main entrance, the facade of the church, its bell tower and its courtyards have been renovated over the past year.

By Saturday, the church’s interior left no trace of the war.

Large chandeliers glittered under the arched stone ceiling as a procession of priests carried incense burners into the cathedral, flanked on both sides by crowds of worshippers.

People pressed up against the walls of the church and filled its wooden benches, their heads turned towards the alter.

Aram Keshishian, the Beirut-based patriarch of the Armenian church, delivered a sermon in Armenian.

After mass, he told reporters that Saturday’s ceremony sent a strong message.

It was a sign “that the Armenian community will continue to reconstruct Syria,” he said.

Syrian Armenian religious leader Harutyun Selimian said the ceremony sparked hopes for a better future for Syria’s Armenian community.

“Our future is bright and in this future we will rebuild a new Syria,” he told AFP.

Jirair Reisian, an Armenian member of the Syrian parliament, said it was a sign that Syria’s Armenian community “is here to stay.”

Christians made up 10 percent of Aleppo’s pre-war population.

Out of the 250,000 that lived in the city before the war, thousands have fled the city since the onset of the conflict in 2011.

Many of the Armenians among them fled to Armenia itself, while others headed to Lebanon.

Few have returned, according to demographic expert Fabrice Balanche.

The old quarter of Aleppo is home to several other churches, including those of the Melkite and Maronite sects.

They too were damaged by the four years of fighting in the former rebel stronghold.

Tens of thousands of Armenians fled to Syria and neighbouring Lebanon in the early 20th century after hundreds of thousands of their kin were massacred by Ottoman forces in 1915.

The war in Syria has killed more than 370,000 people since it started in 2011.


President Donald Trump exceeded his authority when he reversed bans on offshore drilling in vast parts of the Arctic Ocean and dozens of canyons in the Atlantic Ocean, a U.S. judge said in a ruling that restored the Obama-era restrictions.

Judge Sharon Gleason in a decision late Friday threw out Trump’s executive order that overturned the bans that comprised a key part of Obama’s environmental legacy.

Presidents have the power under a federal law to remove certain lands from development but cannot revoke those removals, Gleason said.

“The wording of President Obama’s 2015 and 2016 withdrawals indicates that he intended them to extend indefinitely, and therefore be revocable only by an act of Congress,” said Gleason, who was nominated to the bench by Obama.

A message left Saturday for the Department of Justice was not immediately returned.

The American Petroleum Institute, a defendant in the case, disagreed with the ruling.

“In addition to bringing supplies of affordable energy to consumers for decades to come, developing our abundant offshore resources can provide billions in government revenue, create thousands of jobs and will also strengthen our national security,” it said in a statement.

Eric Grafe, an attorney with Earthjustice, welcomed the ruling, saying it “shows that the president cannot just trample on the Constitution to do the bidding of his cronies in the fossil fuel industry at the expense of our oceans, wildlife and climate.”

Earthjustice represented numerous environmental groups that sued the Trump administration over the April 2017 executive order reversing the drilling bans. At issue in the case was the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act.

Acting Assistant U.S. Attorney General Jeffrey Wood said during a hearing before Gleason in November that environmental groups were misinterpreting the intent of the law written in 1953. He said it is meant to be flexible and sensible and not intended to bind one president with decisions made by another when determining offshore stewardship as needs and realities change over time.

In 2015, Obama halted exploration in coastal areas of the Beaufort and Chukchi seas and the Hanna Shoal, an important area for walrus. In late 2016, he withdrew most other potential Arctic Ocean lease areas — about 98 percent of the Arctic outer continental shelf.

The bans were intended to protect polar bears, walruses, ice seals and Alaska Native villages that depend on the animals.

In the Atlantic, Obama banned exploration in 5,937 square miles (15,377 square kilometers) of underwater canyon complexes, citing their importance for marine mammals, deep-water corals, valuable fish populations and migratory whales.


WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s decision to revive the fight over the Affordable Care Act has stirred a political and policy debate among Republicans on how best to approach the divisive issue heading into the 2020 election.

Failing to repeal and replace the ACA, otherwise known as Obamacare, is one of the biggest shortcomings of the president’s first term. It left Republicans with a broken campaign promise, dismal approval ratings and a narrative they haven’t been able to shake — that they don’t support protecting those with pre-existing medical conditions from high-cost care. In some races, it cost Republican seats last fall, flipping House control to Democrats.

For Trump, the reset he wants is clear. “The Republican Party will soon be known as the party of health care,” he said on Capitol Hill . “You watch!”

But among Republican senators, there’s reluctance to embrace Trump’s new priority. Usually tight-lipped Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who was given little advance notice of the president’s new push, spoke volumes when asked about it.

“I look forward to seeing what the president is proposing,” McConnell told Politico.

And in the House, it’s a mixed bag. Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy initially panned Trump’s move, questioning the timing that collided with Trump’s bounce from the end of special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election. But the GOP leader does see value in kick-starting a health care debate, said a person granted anonymity to discuss the situation. House Republicans continue to be asked about it back home and a new GOP health care bill could improve their standing with voters, the person said.

What’s unclear is whether a Trump-Care bill will emerge from the White House or Capitol Hill to replace the Affordable Care Act or if the president’s push for a policy outcome fades to little more than a topic for the campaign trail.

Trump discussed health care at length during a rally in Michigan Thursday and again during an appearance in Florida Friday.

“We are going to have a plan that’s so much better than Obamacare,” the president promised after touring an aging dike in South Florida.

For Trump, returning to health care shows his commitment to a 2016 campaign pledge and his desire to frame the 2020 debate on his terms.

Stung by the Democratic gains in November and sparked by another ACA legal challenge that could make its way to the Supreme Court, the president dug into the issue this past week, deciding to fight. He feels that it is an important battle to take on, said two people familiar with White House thinking who were not authorized to speak publicly.

The president has been actively engaged in conversations about health care, dialing up lawmakers in the House and Senate, and the White House is expected to lay out further details on his goals in the coming days.

“We are working very hard on that,” said Trump as he was heading out to the Michigan rally, singling out Republican senators John Barrasso, Rick Scott and Bill Cassidy among those involved.

“They are going to work together to come up with something that’s really spectacular,” the president said.

But in truth, there is no grand Republican plan on Capitol Hill to replace Obamacare.

The day after Trump dropped the new priority during a private Senate GOP lunch, a top ally, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., convened an evening meeting of senators to discuss options, according to those familiar with the talks.

Graham had helped spark the idea with Trump during a golf outing at Mar-a-Lago. The group he assembled back on Capitol Hill included two former governors well versed in health care policy — Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, whose Romney-care in Massachusetts was a precursor to Obamacare, and Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, a former health care executive.

But McConnell has made it clear he would rather see Republicans spend their time attacking the Democratic plans to expand existing health care programs, namely the Medicare for All plans embraced by some of the Democrats running to unseat Trump. He sees it as their best option for reversing public opinion heading toward 2020 when he, too, faces re-election. McConnell derides the high cost of a government-run system as “Medicare for None.”

The thinking among McConnell and other leading Republicans is that it’s best to avoid another messy legislative battle. Republicans are loath to repeat the undertaking that consumed much of 2017. At that time, Republicans could never agree on a new health care plan and the months-long exercise ended in failure when John McCain joined others in rejecting one last-ditch effort, dooming the years-long campaign to repeal and replace Obamacare.

They would rather simply wait out the White House with an expectation that no actual legislation emerges, according to those familiar with the GOP thinking.

House Republicans, though, face a different calculus. They lost dozens of seats last fall in part because Democrats successfully attacked them over the GOP proposals to replace Obamacare. Americans have warmed to the 2010 health care law and, in particular, its provision that prevents insurers from charging more to patients pre-existing conditions.

McCarthy wants the majority back, the person said. Even though he questioned Trump’s sudden shift to health care, it has promise. The day after Trump announced his health care push, the GOP leader convened the top House Republicans from various committees to dig into the issue.

“I’ll make this promise to you — and it’s a conversation I had with the president — the Republicans will make sure pre-existing conditions are protected,” McCarthy told reporters. “The president and I have talked numerous times. We talked quite often. But this is one of the conversations we have, greatly, that we support protecting pre-existing conditions.”

But Republicans lost their chance to revise Obamacare when they controlled both chambers in Congress. Now, any bill will need Democratic backing to clear the House with Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s majority.

At most, lawmakers envision a modest package of health care bills that could lower prescription drug prices and other reforms that have wide bipartisan support.

That may or may not be enough for Trump.

And if not, he can continue advocating for more on the campaign trail.

At the rally in Michigan, he vowed, “It’s going to be far better than Obamacare.”

PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Threatening drastic action against Mexico, President Donald Trump declared he is likely to shut down America’s southern border next week unless Mexican authorities immediately halt all illegal immigration. The president, who also cut U.S. aid to three Central American nations whose citizens are fleeing north, emphasized “I am not kidding around” about closing the border, even though such a severe move could hit the economies of both countries.

“It could mean all trade” with Mexico, Trump said when questioned on Friday by reporters in Florida. “We will close it for a long time.”

Though Trump has previously threatened to close the border and has not followed through, his administration moved to cut direct aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. The State Department said in a statement that it will suspend 2017 and 2018 payments to the trio of nations that have been home to some of the migrant caravans that have marched through Mexico to the U.S. border.

Trump has been promising for more than two years to build a long, impenetrable wall along the border to stop illegal immigration, though Congress has been reluctant to provide the money he needs. In the meantime, he has repeatedly threatened to close the border, but this time, with a new surge of migrants heading north , he gave a definite timetable.

A substantial closure could have an especially heavy impact on cross-border communities from San Diego to South Texas, as well as supermarkets that sell Mexican produce, factories that rely on imported parts, and other businesses across the U.S.

The U.S. and Mexico trade about $1.7 billion in goods daily, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which said closing the border would be “an unmitigated economic debacle” that would threaten 5 million American jobs.

Trump tweeted Friday morning, “If Mexico doesn’t immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States through our Southern Border, I will be CLOSING the Border, or large sections of the Border, next week.”

He didn’t qualify his threat with “or large sections,” stating: “There is a very good likelihood I’ll be closing the border next week, and that is just fine with me.”

He said several times that it would be “so easy” for Mexican authorities to stop immigrants passing through their country and trying to enter the U.S. illegally, “but they just take our money and ‘talk.'” The president, with support from conservative media, has made the large caravans symbols of the United States’ immigration problem.

A group of House Democrats visiting El Salvador denounced the administration’s decision to cut aid to the region.

“As we visit El Salvador evaluating the importance of U.S. assistance to Central America to address the root causes of family and child migration, we are extremely disappointed to learn that President Trump intends to cut off aid to the region,” said the statement from five lawmakers, including Rep. Eliot L. Engel of New York, who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee.. “The President’s approach is entirely counterproductive.”

Short of a widespread shutdown, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said the U.S. might close designated ports of entry to re-deploy staff to help process parents and children. Ports of entry are official crossing points that are used by residents and commercial vehicles. Many people who cross the border illegally ultimately request asylum under U.S. law, which does not require asylum seekers to enter at an official crossing.

“If we have to close ports to take care of all of the numbers who are coming, we will do that,” Nielsen said. “So it’s on the table, but what we’re doing is a very structured process based on operational needs.”

Trump’s latest declaration came after Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said his country was doing its part to fight migrant smuggling. Criminal networks charge thousands of dollars a person to move migrants through Mexico, increasingly in large groups toward remote sections of the border.

“We want to have a good relationship with the government of the United States,” Lopez Obrador said Friday. He added: “We are going to continue helping so that the migratory flow, those who pass through our country, do so according to the law, in an orderly way.”

Marcelo Ebrard, Mexico’s foreign relations secretary, tweeted that his country “doesn’t act based on threats” and is “the best neighbor” the U.S. could have.

Customs and Border Protection commissioner Kevin McAleenan said Wednesday that 750 border inspectors would be reassigned to deal with the growing number of migrant families.

In Florida, Trump was also asked about the two migrant children who died in U.S. custody in December. Is the administration equipped to handle sick children who are detained?

“I think that it has been very well stated that we have done a fantastic job,” he said, defending Border Patrol efforts to help the children.

Trump said that in one of the cases “the father gave the child no water for a long period of time,” although an autopsy released Friday made no mention of dehydration.

“It was a very tough situation and that trek up, that’s a long hard trek,” he said. “It’s a horrible situation. But Mexico could stop it.”

Democratic and Republican lawmakers have fought over Trump’s contention that there is a “crisis” at the border, particularly amid his push for a border wall. He claims a wall would solve immigration problems, though it wouldn’t keep out families who cross at official points so they can surrender and be detained.

The Department of Homeland Security wants the authority to detain families for longer and more quickly deport children from Central America who arrive at the border on their own. The department argues those policy changes would stop families from trying to enter the U.S.

Alejandra Mier y Teran, executive director of the Otay Mesa Chamber of Commerce in San Diego, said the mere threat of border closures sends the wrong message to businesses in Mexico and may eventually scare companies into turning to Asia for their supply chains.

“I think the impact would be absolutely devastating on so many fronts,” said Mier y Teran, whose members rely on the Otay Mesa crossing to bring televisions, medical devices and a wide range of products to the U.S. “In terms of a long-term effect, it’s basically shooting yourself in your foot. It’s sending out a message to other countries that, ‘Don’t come because our borders may not work at any time.’ That is extremely scary and dangerous.”

Merchant reported from Houston, Lucey from Washington. Associated Press writers Peter Orsi in Mexico City, Elliot Spagat in San Diego and Matthew Lee in Washington contributed to this report.


WASHINGTON (AP) — A Trump administration official says they are aiming to greatly expand the number of asylum seekers sent back over the southern border each day.

It is meant to address the swelling number of arriving Central Americans. It could be difficult to achieve; the program started Jan. 29 and has been slow to get going and has suffered scheduling glitches.

Right now, about 60 asylum seekers a day are returned at the San Ysidro, Calexico and El Paso ports of entry.

They return to the U.S. for court dates.

The official says the goal is to have as many as 300 people returned per day by the end of next week. The official had knowledge of the plans but was unauthorized to speak publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.


On Friday’s “PBS NewsHour,” New York Times columnist David Brooks stated that many people “got out ahead of the evidence” and falsely claimed that there was collusion with Russia, and that it’s false for President Trump to claim he’s exonerated.

Brooks said, “[A] lot of people got out ahead of the evidence and claimed there was collusion and claimed there — he was an agent, that he had betrayed the country. And they did their cause great harm. Because they allowed Donald Trump to say, see, they’re wrong. And they were wrong.”

He added, “For Donald Trump to claim that he’s therefore exonerated is the exact opposite of the truth.”

On Friday’s “PBS NewsHour,” New York Times columnist David Brooks said that it’s “something of a mystery” why President Trump thinks pivoting to health care is a good idea.

Brooks remarked that Republicans will become the party of health care, “After he’s the president of humility and modesty.”

He added that Republicans, “could come up with a plan, which would be a good thing to do. But why Donald Trump thinks this is the right move for him or for his party is something of a mystery. And it’s always an error, I think, with the president to try to divine his motives and his strategy. Because there’s usually no — nothing back there. It’s just things coming out.”

Washington (AFP) – Tiger Woods defeated Rory McIlroy 2&1 in a dramatic showdown Saturday, grabbing an early lead and never trailing to reach the quarter-finals of the WGC Match Play Championship.

In McIlroy’s first match-play battle with boyhood idol Woods, the Northern Ireland star couldn’t muster a birdie over his first 11 holes and endured a 16th-hole disaster to fall in the feature morning match before roaring crowds at Austin (Texas) Country Club.

“It was big for us inside the ropes too,” Woods said. “It was fun for us. We battled hard against each other. I was fortunate to come out on top.”

Woods, a 14-time major champion, booked an afternoon quarter-final against Denmark’s Lucas Bjerregaard, who ousted Sweden’s Henrik Stenson 3&2.

Wind and rain struck on the back nine but Woods weathered the storm to stay in contention for his fourth WGC Match Play crown and first since 2008.

“We had some interesting conditions,” Woods said. “The wind changed. I played pretty consistent the entire day. I didn’t give him any holes and Rory didnt make any putts. It was a tough day all around and I’m happy to advance.”

Woods sank a tense 7-foot par putt at 15 to keep a 1-up lead but was buried under a bunker lip off the tee at the par-5 16th and looked set to lose the hole.

But McIlroy was undone after a mammoth 395-yard tee shot. He found right rough, then with one foot in sand chipped over the green against a boundary marker. He rechipped only to find a bunker, then blasted to two feet and surrendered the hole.

Woods missed the green at the par-3 17th but holed a 13-foot par putt to halve the hole and win the match.

McIlroy, the 2015 champion, and Stenson, the 2007 winner, each went unbeaten in group play, which trimmed the field of 64 to 16 for weekend knockout matches, with a record eight Europeans reaching the last 16.

– Rory’s No. 1 bid foiled –

Former world number one Woods, two wins shy of Sam Snead’s all-time record of 82 US PGA wins, had not been in the event since 2013 and hadn’t made the last eight in 11 years.

But the 43-year-old American showed his skills in the format have not waned despite a winless Ryder Cup effort last year in France.

McIlroy, a four-time major winner who can complete a Career Grand Slam in two weeks by winnings the Masters, could have jumped to world number one by winning the title after a Players Championship win two weeks ago.

Woods took a 1-up edge with a birdie at the par-4 fifth hole, blasting his tee shot into greenside rough then chipping to four feet and making the putt.

At the par-5 sixth, Woods chipped from the fairway to three feet and sank his birdie putt for a 2-up edge.

McIlroy, who dropped only three holes in three group-stage matches, lipped out on a 3-foot par putt to lose the 10th hole and fall 3-down.

But his search for a weekend birdie ended at the par-5 12th as his approach landed two feet from the cup, and McIlroy added another from five feet at 13 to pull within 1-down, setting up the final drama.

– Molinari wins, Rose out –

Reigning British Open champion Francesco Molinari, Europe’s Ryder Cup hero in beating the US team last year in France, eliminated English 10th seed Paul Casey 5&4.

The seventh-seeded Italian will next face America’s Kevin Na, who upset English second seed Justin Rose 2-up, foiling his bid to claim the world number one spot.

Na squared the match from 2-down, saw Rose restore the lead, then birdied three holes in a row for a 1-up lead after 14. Rose had a shot at 15 blown into the grandstands by a wind gust and Na parred the hole to go 2-up.

Rose birdied the par-5 16th but Na birdied 18 for the win.

South Africa’s Louis Oosthuizen beat Australia’s seed Marc Leishman 2&1 to reach a last-eight date with Kevin Kisner of the United States.

Oosthuizen, the 2010 British Open winner, sank a 23-foot birdie putt to halve the par-3 17th for the victory.

Kisner, last year’s runner-up, birdied four of the first five holes in routing China’s Li Haotong 6&5.

US 23rd seed Matt Kuchar beat English 35th seed Tyrrell Hatton 4&3 to reach a quarter-final against Spanish 26th seed Sergio Garcia, who beat South African Branden Grace 1-up.


Washington (AFP) – Scientists in the US say they have discovered the fossilized remains of a mass of creatures that died minutes after a huge asteroid slammed into the Earth 66 million years ago, sealing the fate of the dinosaurs.

In a paper to be published Monday, a team of paleontologists headquartered at the University of Kansas say they found a “mother lode of exquisitely preserved animal and fish fossils” in what is now North Dakota.

The asteroid’s impact in what is now Mexico was the most cataclysmic event ever known to befall Earth, eradicating 75 percent of the planet’s animal and plant species, extinguishing the dinosaurs and paving the way for the rise of humans.

Researchers believe the impact set off fast-moving, seismic surges that triggered a sudden, massive torrent of water and debris from an arm of an inland sea known as the Western Interior Seaway.

At the Tanis site in North Dakota’s Hell Creek Formation, the surge left “a tangled mass of freshwater fish, terrestrial vertebrates, trees, branches, logs, marine ammonites and other marine creatures,” according to Robert DePalma, the report’s lead author.

Some of the fish fossils were found to have inhaled “ejecta” associated with the Chicxulub event, suggesting seismic surges reached North Dakota within “tens of minutes,” he said.

“The sedimentation happened so quickly everything is preserved in three dimensions — they’re not crushed,” said co-author David Burnham.

“It’s like an avalanche that collapses almost like a liquid, then sets like concrete. They were killed pretty suddenly because of the violence of that water. We have one fish that hit a tree and was broken in half.”

The fossils at Tanis include what were believed to be several newly identified fish species, and others that were “the best examples of their kind,” said DePalma, a graduate student and curator of the Palm Beach Museum of Natural History in Florida.

“We look at moment-by-moment records of one of the most notable impact events in Earth’s history. No other site has a record quite like that,” he said.

“And this particular event is tied directly to all of us — to every mammal on Earth, in fact. Because this is essentially where we inherited the planet. Nothing was the same after that impact. It became a planet of mammals rather than a planet of dinosaurs.”

The paper is to be published in the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences.


El Paso (United States) (AFP) – Beto O’Rourke, the youthful Democrat who seized national attention last fall with an unexpectedly strong Senate campaign in conservative Texas, formally launched his presidential candidacy Saturday in his hometown of El Paso, vowing to bring a unifying dynamic, progressive values and generational change to American politics.

“This is our moment of truth, and we cannot be found wanting,” he told an enthusiastic crowd of at least 1,000.

Speaking from a spot only blocks from the border with Mexico, he underscored some of his most vigorous differences with the man he hopes to succeed in the White House — Donald Trump — without ever naming the US president.

While Trump seeks to build a border wall and threatened just days ago to close the frontier if Mexico fails to stem the influx of undocumented immigrants, O’Rourke described America as “a country of immigrants and asylum seekers and refugees (who) are the very premise of our strength, of our success and, yes, our security.”

In an implicit rebuke to Trump, O’Rourke said that his hometown was safer because of its immigrants, not more dangerous.

If elected he said he would pursue comprehensive immigration reform, reunite immigrant families separated at the border and “bring millions more (undocumented immigrants) out of the shadows.”

Speaking energetically as he roamed about a stage with the sleeves of his Oxford shirt rolled, the 46-year-old listed his priorities: remaking an economy “that works too well for too few and not at all for too many”; moving toward “high-quality universal healthcare”; and seizing the nation’s “last best hope of averting a (climate) catastrophe.”

He called for the US to wind down its foreign wars, strengthen its alliances, and “end these love affairs with dictators and strongmen.”

His message clearly was geared not just to El Pasoans but to Democrats nationwide as the party gears up for an extended campaign to see who will challenge Trump in 2020.

O’Rourke pointed out that he helped boost voter turnout in Texas — particularly among the young — to some of its highest levels in years.

He had made his intention to run for the presidency known in mid-March, and in a single day raked in a huge $6.1 million in donations, giving himself instant relevance in the crowded Democratic field.

He since has been campaigning — usually before large crowds — in early-voting states including Iowa and New Hampshire.

And on Saturday, O’Rourke — who during his Senate campaign visited every one of Texas’s 254 counties — continued his peripatetic ways, heading from his El Paso kickoff to rallies in Houston and Austin, the state capital.

The 46-year-old former congressman and onetime punk rocker was born Robert O’Rourke but widely known as “Beto.” His nearly successful campaign in November against incumbent Senator Ted Cruz brought him national attention.

Some Democrats hope O’Rourke might even be able to turn reliably red Texas to Democratic blue, though first he would have to wade through the huge field of 16 Democrats now in the running — including a popular fellow Texan, Julian Castro.

Other Democratic rivals include senators Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar.

The Democratic frontrunner, former vice president Joe Biden, is not even officially in the race, but polls show him as the leading contender for the party’s nomination, with 29.2 percent support, according to the RealClearPolitics average of the six latest surveys.

Sanders is second at 21.8 percent, followed by Harris at 9.8 and O’Rourke at 9.2.

The newest rising star of the pack is Pete Buttigieg, 37, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana and a military veteran, who would be the youngest and the first openly gay president should he win.

O’Rourke is an unorthodox candidate, with a comparatively thin political resume and with a seeming allergy to being labeled a liberal. During his six years in Congress, O’Rourke was more politically cautious, joining the House’s centrist coalition.

But as the Democratic presidential field tilts leftward, he has hit on several progressive talking points.

In addition to supporting a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, he backs marijuana legalization and champions the Green New Deal, a sweeping climate change mitigation framework.

He called Saturday for paid family leave, equal pay for women and an end to for-profit prisons.

On his first major campaign tour, which took him to eight states including New Hampshire, South Carolina and Ohio, he met people in coffee shops, school gyms and taquerias, offering a unifying vision packed with optimism but short on policy specifics.


March 30 (UPI) — President Donald Trump has signed a permit that allows for construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline and a facility in Montana as work has been delayed because of a federal court order.

In the presidential decision Friday, the permit authorizes TransCanada Corp., subject to certain conditions, to “construct, connect, operate, and maintain pipeline facilities at the international boundary between the United States and Canada for the import of oil from Canada to the United States.”

Last November, U.S. District Court Judge Brian Morris invalidated an earlier permit in a lawsuit filed by three Native American tribes in Montana and South Dakota. The ruling is being appealed in the 9th Circuit.

“For the avoidance of doubt, I hereby revoke that March 23, 2017, permit,” Trump wrote in Friday’s order.

Trump, in an executive order, previously reversed former President Obama’s 2015 denial of the pipeline permit. The pipeline was first proposed more than 10 years ago under President George W. Bush.

TransCanada Corp. wants to build a 1,184-mile pipeline that would move 800,000 barrels of crude oil daily from Alberta, Canada, through the Central Plains to the Gulf Coast. A presidential permit is needed because the 36-inch pipe moves across state borders.

“President Trump has been clear that he wants to create jobs and advance U.S. energy security and the Keystone XL pipeline does both of those things,” Russ Girling, TransCanada’s president and chief executive officer, said in a statement. “We thank President Trump for his leadership and steadfast support to enable the advancement of this critical energy infrastructure project for North America.

“The magnitude of the work on this project has been extensive. The Keystone XL pipeline has been studied more than any other pipeline in history and the environmental reviews are clear — the project can be built and operated in an environmentally sustainable and responsible way.”

TransCanada has more than 57,500 miles of gas transmission networks across North America.

The XL Pipeline has been criticized for its possible environmental impact.

The pipeline route would cross the Milk River, west of Nashua, and the Missouri River — 57 miles upstream from the intake of the Assiniboine and Sioux Rural Water Supply System.

“The Keystone XL tar sands pipeline was a bad idea from Day One and it remains a terrible idea. If built, it would threaten our land, our drinking water, and our communities from Montana and Nebraska to the Gulf Coast,” Anthony Swift, director of the Canada project at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a statement.

“President Trump is once again showing his disdain for the rule of law. Last time the president tried to ram this permit through he lost in court. We are going to continue to fight this dangerous tar sands pipeline proposal.”

Last September, the Rosebud Sioux, Fort Belknap Indian Community and Gros Ventre tribes filed a lawsuit that said the Trump administration granted TransCanada the permit without a proper study of the impacts a massive pipeline project would have on the land.

Morris’ court order said the administration’s use of a 2014 environmental review to justify a presidential permit for construction violated the National Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act and the Administrative Procedure Act.

In the permit, Trump wrote the construction, connection, operation, and maintenance of the facilities, not including the route, must be “consistent with applicable law, as described in the permittee’s application for a Presidential permit filed on May 4, 2012, and resubmitted on January 26, 2017.”

Also, the facilities must be subject to inspection by the representatives of appropriate federal, state and local agencies. The permittee is responsible for acquiring any right-of-way grants or easements, permits and other authorizations that may become necessary or appropriate.


March 30 (UPI) — Black box data suggest a faulty sensor on a Boeing 737 Max 8 activated an automated system to cause the plane to nose-dive and crash in Ethiopia, killing all on board 20 days ago.

Data from the angle-of-attack sensor incorrectly activated the automated system that pushed the plane into an irreversible nose-dive on March 10, The New York Times reported, citing unnamed individuals briefed on the contents of the plane’s black box. The crash killed all 157 people aboard, including eight Americans. The Federal Aviation Administration ordered the grounding of all Boeing 737 Max 8 and Max 9 aircraft a few days later.

Black box recorder data indicated that the new automated anti-stall system on the Boeing 737 Max jet caused the nose-dive, people briefed on the probe told Bloomberg. One of two sensors near the plane’s nose would have had to malfunction or be damaged for this to occur.

The sensor’s role in engaging the automated system raised concern about whether it relied too much on a single device instead of using multiple data points to guide the plane’s trajectory.

The crash near Addis Ababa was the second crash involving the Boeing model in less than six months and bore similarities to another crash of the same model in October in Indonesia that killed 189 people.

In that crash, Indonesian Lion Air pilots weren’t able to shut off the anti-stall system, called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, as the jet crashed into the Java Sea.

After the Indonesia crash, airline officials said they alerted pilots of the potential of the augmentation system to push down the plane’s nose during a malfunction and highlighted a procedure to disable it by hitting switches in the cockpit if it occurred.

The reason the angle-of-attack sensor malfunctioned in the Ethiopia flight is not yet clear, people briefed on the probe said.

In the Lion Air crash, the sensor failed on an earlier flight and wasn’t repaired, initial findings show.

Garima Sethi, the wife of the Lion Air flight pilot, pushed for months for Boeing to ground the 737 Max 8, and believe the Ethiopia crash.

“We tried to do our part, but nobody heard us,” Sethi said.


March 30 (UPI) — The third and final season of the anthology series Easy is to begin streaming on Netflix on May 10.

The last nine episodes of the relationship dramedy will star Elizabeth Reaser, Michael Chernus, Jake Johnson, Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Marc Maron.

“Easy has been the most exciting and important project of my career. The anthology format allowed me to explore a range of stories and characters, but small moments of incidental overlap, or deep relationships between characters, connected the episodes enough that we were able to build a fictional community rooted in a real Chicago,” series creator Joe Swanberg said in a statement.

“The fact that I was able to collaborate with so many of my favorite actors took an already dreamy experience to the next level. I couldn’t be more proud of the new season and I can’t wait to share it.”


TULSA, Okla. (AP) — A Tulsa museum will soon open a new Bob Dylan exhibit that will showcase 12 pastel portraits the musician painted.

The Gilcrease Museum will display “Bob Dylan: Face Value and Beyond” from May 10 to Sept. 15, the Tulsa World reported.

The exhibit is filled with pieces from the Bob Dylan Archives, which has more than 100,000 items from his 60-year career. It’s the first major show from the archives since it was acquired by the George Kaiser Family Foundation and the University of Tulsa in 2016.

The paintings highlight Dylan’s multifaceted artistic capabilities, said Michael Chaiken, the archive’s curator.

“He’s best known for his music, but Dylan is also a writer of prose, a filmmaker, and someone who has been involved in the visual arts for decades,” Chaiken said. “This show is an opportunity to explore all those different avenues of Dylan’s creativity.”

The portraits were first shown in London in 2013. The only time they were on display in the U.S. was during a two-month exhibit in Ohio in 2016.

Unlike previous displays, the Gilcrease exhibit will give more context to Dylan’s portraits, Chaiken said.

“Here we’re able to highlight the fact that there is a precedent for those portraits,” he said. “Bob Dylan has been painting and drawing since at least the 1960s, although it’s only been in recent years that he’s put his work on display. So we have a lot of material to illustrate that, including drawings and sketchbooks that have never been shown before.”

The exhibit will also include handwritten song lyrics, a black leather jacket, an electric guitar and screen tests filmed by Andy Warhol.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Donald Glover, Beyonce and “Black Panther” will be honored and vie for awards at Saturday’s 50th NAACP Image Awards.

Anthony Anderson returns as host of the show devoted to works by entertainers and writers of color at the Dolby Theatre, the same venue where that hosts the Academy Awards. The ceremony airs live on TV One.

Glover, who won four Grammys this year, is nominated for his acting and directing on “Atlanta,” which is up for best comedy series. On the music side, his alter-ego Childish Gambino is nominated for top male performer and his song “This is America” is nominated for best video and song.

“Black Panther” is nominated for 14 awards including best motion picture along with “BlacKkKlansman,” ”Crazy Rich Asians,” ”If Beale Street Could Talk” and “The Hate U Give.”

Jussie Smollett is nominated for outstanding supporting actor in a drama series for his role in “Empire,” but his representative says he’s not planning to attend.

It’s been a tumultuous week for the actor-singer after a felony case against him was dropped in Chicago. The handling of the case, which accused Smollett of falsely reporting to police that he was assaulted by two men in downtown Chicago early Jan. 29, has drawn widespread condemnation.

Beyonce, LeBron James, Regina King, Chadwick Boseman and Ryan Coogler are nominated for entertainer of the year.

U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters will receive the NAACP Chairman’s Award for public service.

Left-wing Hollywood director Rob Reiner has thrown in with those who believe U.S. Attorney General William Barr is attempting to “gas light” the American people after releasing the summary of the Mueller report, which concluded that President Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign did not “collude” with Russia.

Reiner, who spent years telling his Twitter followers that the report by special counsel Robert Mueller would prove to be the noose that would hang president Trump, is now saying that the summary of Mueller’s 400-page report delivered by U.S. Attorney General William Barr is a false presentation of Mueller’s findings. Reiner also hinted to his followers that Barr’s summary meant to mislead America into believing that President Donald Trump is innocent of the charges the left has hurled at him for over two years.

“Autocracy 101: Continually lie and tell you not to believe what you see with your own eyes,” Reiner blathered. “Trump, with the protection of cult GOP, FOX, & AG Barr, is in full gas light mode. We’ve seen Collusion & Obstruction in plain sight. Reality is reality. Truth is truth. Trust Your Eyes.”

But what Rob Reiner ignored with his attack on the integrity of Barr’s report is that Robert Mueller has been involved with Barr’s efforts to write a summary and to redact the full report for public release. So, if Barr was lying about Mueller’s report, how could Mueller be silent about an attempted gaslighting?

More likely, Barr’s work is a reflection of Mueller’s full report.

Berlin (AFP) – Young Germans are making themselves heard with demonstrations over climate change on Friday, marking a passionate engagement with politics not seen since reunification in the fast-ageing nation.

Inspired by Swedish teen climate activist Greta Thunberg, 16, who began going on strike from school on Fridays, thousands of under 21s across Germany have been joining weekly marches rather than sitting in class.

Their sudden engagement has left politicians at a loss as to how to react, observers said, noting that it could yet spark a change in policymaking that has long been dominated by pensioner concerns.

More than 20,000 people joined Thunberg in Berlin on Friday, many bearing home-made posters with slogans like “Our house is on fire” or “You’re never too small to make a difference”.

“We want a future, is that too much to ask?” Thunberg said, speaking at the Brandenburg Gate.

Franziska Wessel, one of the organisers of the protests in Berlin, voted: “We’re going to continue skipping classes every Friday because we can’t keep going like that with the climate. We have to pull the emergency brakes.”

For law student Franziska Heinisch, 19, the Fridays demonstrations are “not a cute, puberty rebellion”.

“It is a serious fight for our future,” she wrote in a column in Zeit weekly.

Klaus Hurrelmann of the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin noted that such teen activism has not been seen in Europe’s biggest economy since reunification in 1990.

“It’s very unusual,” he told AFP.

– ‘Helpless and confused’ –

Youth involvement reached a trough during the 2008 financial crisis, but then slowly began to recover as online social networks provided a platform that allows for quick mobilisation.

Their engagement also comes during a sustained period of economic prosperity and low unemployment in Germany.

Analysts believe that Thunberg with her remarkable drive helped spark the change.

“Her stubbornness, her strikes, her preparedness on the climate topic is being copied. In short, Greta is a model,” Hurrelmann said.

The determination shown by the younger generation has left politicians “at once helpless and confused,” said the professor.

This is particularly the case for Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservative bloc.

Economy Minister Peter Altmaier has urged students not to skip school. “The demonstrations would not be less effective outside class hours,” he said.

But the chancellor herself has welcomed their fight — something that Blasel finds “ridiculous” as “the protests are directed against Angela Merkel and her government which has done nothing to stop the climate crisis.”

– Generation battle –

Beyond the climate issue, the return of youths to the streets is forcing political powers to reckon with them.

With seniors making up the biggest group of voters, critics have long accused political parties of pushing above all policies that favour pensioners.

One in five adults is now over 65, but the trend could be exacerbated as more baby boomers leave the labour market in droves.

“The youth lack a clear policy on what our society will look like in 20 or 30 years”, and are now taking matters into their own hands, said Horst Opaschowski, who leads a research institute on future trends in Hamburg.

Observers believe that the youth revolt is the result of a yawning generation gap.

“A vote of defiance as clear as has been expressed in the last weeks (with the Friday demonstrations) is unique and should shake up the parties,” noted Spiegel news magazine.

At the same time, if the youths and their concerns are taken seriously, that could be an opportunity, said Hurrelmann.

Lowering the voting age to 16 as suggested by the Social Democrats, junior partners in Merkel’s coalition, or imposing a quota for candidates under 30 at the next elections, could encourage young people to join political parties which are seeking rejuvenation, he said.


Cradle Mountain (Australia) (AFP) – A contagious cancer is threatening Tasmanian devils with extinction, but these unique carnivores — and their human helpers — are adapting at breakneck speed, giving new hope for their survival.

Evolutionary change is usually measured over millennia, but in the craggy mountains of northern Tasmania, it can be seen in real time.

Three decades after the first cases of a fatal transmissible cancer scythed through Tasmanian devil populations, experts are seeing dramatic changes in the 15 percent of creatures that have survived.

The cancer spreads via the bite of an infected individual, usually during mating or when they challenge each other jaw to jaw.

But scientists have reported that the famously feisty devils — now numbering 15,000-18,000 — are fighting back, with the first signs of an immune response reported.

The disease is still almost always fatal, and a second strain is being investigated, but antibodies have been detected in infected animals for the first time and more than two dozen have contracted the cancer and survived.

“We have seen animals that are not contracting the disease. We have seen animals that even if they contract the disease, they survive for much longer,” said Rodrigo Hamede at the University of Tasmania.

“We are also seeing a small number of animals that have managed to regress tumours — in other words to cure themselves of the cancer.”

Experts working with the marsupials every day also report significant behavioural changes taking place that have helped steady population numbers.

Chris Coupland is the senior keeper at “Devils @ Cradle”, a refuge that allows tourists to see the elusive animals up close, but which also keeps an insurance population — a kind of Ark, safe from the rising tide of disease.

“The rate of decline was serious and the risk of extinction was there,” he says while playing with two young, relatively tame devils he hand-raised. “It’s still there.”

Coupland reports a number of promising trends, particularly devils mating at a younger age and females being on heat more than once a year.

“For the first time we had multiple oestruses, and that’s becoming more common,” said Coupland, adding that it was probably due to a lower population density.

Coupland says they are also seeing the survivors become sexually active at an earlier age.

With fewer devils, food is more abundant and competition is reduced, allowing the animals to reach mating weight more quickly.

“These days they seem to be breeding at one (year old), whereas historically it was two.”

Together these trends are helping population numbers stabilise.

Humans are also doing their part, developing databases of devil DNA that allows a handful of centres to breed the animals with maximum genetic diversity.

“We have to be cautious of the concept of functional extinction of the animals,” said Coupland.

If devil numbers were to get closer to 10,000, then that is a real risk.

Devils are still listed as endangered on the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) red list, “right at the upper end of animal conservation classification,” he added.

The fate of devils on mainland Australia, where they were wiped out by dingoes, or the extinction of the island’s Thylacine or “Tasmanian tiger” offers a cautionary warning.

But Hamede says the startling rate of devils’ adaption to the disease is a reason for optimism and could provide clues about human cancer treatment.

Adaption happens “all the time with diseases,” he said. “But they happen on evolutionary timescales, they are not happening in six to eight generations (12-16 years). This is an incredibly fast evolution.”


Kathmandu (AFP) – For generations climbing has been firmly the realm of men among the legendary Sherpas of Nepal, tradition dictating women care for the home while their husbands conquer the Himalayan peaks.

But that convention is being challenged by two Sherpa women attempting to summit Everest and force a rethink about the role of widows in their conservative community, after their husbands died on the world’s highest mountain.

Furdiki Sherpa and Nima Doma Sherpa hail from the Himalayan people revered for their skill at high altitudes as climbing guides.

Neither woman ever dreamed of making an expedition to the roof of the world themselves. But that is exactly what they are preparing to do when the short spring climbing season gets underway in April.

“The men climb. We had other things to do. I was running a tea house and taking care of my family. I didn’t think about climbing the mountains,” Furdiki told AFP.

That changed in 2013 when she lost her husband to the mountain as he fixed ropes along the route that aid climbers to the summit.

Like many Sherpa women before her, Furdiki was suddenly alone without a breadwinner to help raise their three children, bearing the stigma of misfortune that can stalk widows in Nepal.

A year later, another tragedy brought her into contact with Nima Doma, whose husband was swept to his death with 15 other Nepali guides in a deadly Everest avalanche.

“After our husbands passed away, we spent months just crying at home over their memories. But we had to take care of our family and ourselves. It was not easy to do this as a widow,” said Nima Doma.

In need of work, the pair sought jobs as trekking guides in the capital Kathmandu, and often crossed paths as they lit lamps at a local Buddhist stupa for their deceased husbands.

“We started sharing our stories, our grief, and what we should do in life,” Furdiki said.

After helping guide some amateur treks the women embarked on serious mountaineering training and soon plans to summit Everest took shape.

In November, they successfully climbed Island Peak and Chulu Far East Peak, both difficult ascents over 6,000 metres (19,700 feet).

“They grew up in the mountains,” said Ang Tshering Lama, whose Angs Himalayan Adventure company is organising their ‘Two Widow Expedition’ to Everest.

“As climbers they are very strong and determined.”

– ‘Double challenge’-

Their Everest dream comes as attitudes toward women and climbing are slowly changing in the overwhelmingly male-dominated industry.

Last season 18 women reached the top of Everest — towering over the world at 8,848-metre (29,029-foot) — a record number, according to Nepal’s department of tourism.

Women trekking guides are more popular than ever but they are still vastly outnumbered on Everest — and Sherpa women even more so.

Close to 4,000 Sherpa men have ascended the peak, according to the reputable Himalayan Database, compared to just 34 women from the legendary ethnic group.

Professional climber Lhakpa Sherpa, 44, is the best known having topped Everest nine times, but she remains very much an anomaly.

“Women are rarely encouraged to take up climbing,” said Dawa Yangzum Sherpa, the only internationally certified female mountaineering guide in Nepal.

Sherpa society, like many ethnic groups in Nepal, is conservative and patriarchal. Wives and daughters are expected to keep the home fires burning while the men climb mountains.

But many die in the process. The Himalayan Database estimates that as many as one third of all Everest deaths have been Sherpas, leaving women to raise and run households despite the loss of the main breadwinner.

“It is difficult and confusing for them. They are usually dependent on their husbands and not educated. And suddenly they are faced with the responsibility of taking care of the family,” said Tsering Dolker Sherpa of the Juniper Fund, a non-profit that works with families of deceased mountain workers,

For women left to pick up the pieces, their grief and struggle is compounded by their newfound status as widows, one that carries stigma. In some parts, widows are considered bad luck and ostracised.

“Furdiki and Nima Doma are fighting a double challenge stepping into this industry– as women and as widows,” said Dawa Yangzum Sherpa, the female professional guide.

The pair said meeting other Sherpa widows who endured discrimination has strengthened their resolve to reach the summit.

“We want to climb Everest with a message for widows and single women. We are not less than anyone, we are capable of achieving anything,” Nima Doma said.


GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) — Tens of thousands of Palestinians rallied in the Gaza Strip on Saturday to mark the first anniversary of their mass protests along the Israeli border, as the territory’s Hamas leaders largely restrained the crowds ahead of a hoped-for cease-fire deal.

Demonstrators largely kept their distance from the border, though small crowds of activists approached the perimeter fence and threw stones and explosives toward Israeli troops on the other side. The forces responded with tear gas and opened fire, killing two Palestinians and wounding 64.

Hamas had pledged to keep the crowds a safe distance from the fence as Egyptian mediators were working to cement a deal that Hamas hopes will ease a crippling Israeli-Egyptian blockade of the crowded territory. Hamas officials say that Israel is offering a package of economic incentives in exchange for calm along the volatile border.

Khalil al-Hayya, a senior Hamas official, said the group had received “positive signs” from the Egyptians. He added that the Egyptian team was to return to Israel on Sunday to continue the talks. “We will continue our marches until all our goals are achieved,” he said.

Saturday’s protest comes at a sensitive time, with Israel and Hamas, bitter enemies that have fought three wars and dozens of smaller skirmishes, both having a strong interest in keeping things quiet.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is seeking his fourth consecutive term in April 9 elections, but is facing a serious challenge from a group of ex-army chiefs who have criticized what they say is his failed Gaza policy. With a lack of alternatives, Netanyahu has been forced at times to rely on Hamas to maintain stability along Israel’s volatile southern front.

In the final stretch of the campaign, Netanyahu needs to keep the Israel-Gaza frontier quiet, without seeming to make concessions to Hamas. Netanyahu took heavy criticism this week for what was seen as a soft response to renewed rocket fire out of Gaza.

Hamas, meanwhile, faces growing unrest in Gaza as a result of worsening conditions after more than a decade of an Israeli-Egyptian blockade. The two countries imposed the blockade in 2007 after Hamas, an Islamic militant group that seeks Israel’s destruction, seized control of Gaza from the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority.

The blockade has helped drive unemployment over 50 percent, led to chronic power outages and made it extremely difficult for Gazans to travel out of the territory.

Earlier this month, Hamas violently suppressed several days of public protests, staged under the slogan “We want to live,” over the dire conditions.

Speaking on the group’s Al-Aqsa TV station, Hamas’ top leader in Gaza, Yehya Sinwar, praised the protesters. “With this big turnout, our people say, ‘We want to live!”

His use of the protesters’ slogan appeared to be aimed at diverting the recent criticism of his group. Hamas blames the blockade and punitive measures by its West Bank-based Palestinian Authority for worsening the living conditions.

The fence protests, which began exactly a year ago, have been aimed in large part at breaking the Israeli-Egyptian blockade on Gaza, but haven’t delivered major improvements.

Saturday’s demonstrations were held at five rallying points along the border with Israel. Dozens of volunteers in fluorescent vests were deployed to restrain demonstrators, and cool rainy weather also appeared to affect enthusiasm.

But as the crowds swelled throughout the afternoon in response to Hamas’ calls for a large turnout, dozens of protesters approached the fence, unfurling Palestinian flags and throwing rocks and explosives toward Israeli soldiers. The Israeli forces responded with tear gas and live fire.

The Israeli military estimated 40,000 Palestinians were gathered at the marches.

“The rioters are hurling rocks and setting tires on fire. In addition, a number of grenades and explosive devices have been hurled at the Gaza Strip security fence,” it said in a statement.

In a statement, Prime Minister Netanyahu praised the army’s preparation and performance in maintaining “calm.”

Gaza’s Health Ministry said that a 17-year-old protester died immediately after being shot in the face in east Gaza City. In the evening, the ministry said another 17-year-old died hours after being shot in the chest in a different protest location.

While bloodshed was not avoided, it was far less than previous high-profile protests. Over 60 people were killed during intense protests on May 14, the day the U.S. moved its embassy to Jerusalem.

As Saturday’s protest was winding down, organizers vowed to continue the marches and said they would gather again as usual next Friday.

The military released video footage showing large crowds of protesters gathered near the fence and hurling objects.

In one scene, a group of activists went up to the fence and hurled stones at the other side. In another scene, a youth could be seen trying to pull apart barbed wire along the fence.

The army also said it caught two young Palestinian children who had tried to cross the border with a knife. The children were returned to Gaza through a border crossing.

Earlier on Saturday, Gaza health officials said Israeli troops shot and killed a 21-year-old Palestinian man near the perimeter fence, hours before the mass rally.

The army said about 200 Palestinians “rioted during the night along the fence” and that the army used riot dispersal means against them.

The marches near were initially organized by grassroots activists who were calling for a mass return to ancestral homes in what is now Israel.

Hamas quickly took the lead in the protests, using the gatherings to call for an easing of the blockade.

The border marches routinely ended in confrontations, with some of the Palestinian demonstrators burning tires, hurling fire bombs or setting off explosives and Israeli troops firing live rounds and tear gas.

According to a Gaza rights group and a count by The Associated Press, 196 Palestinians were killed in the demonstrations over the past year, including 41 minors, and thousands were wounded by live fire. An Israeli soldier was also killed in the context of the marches.

Israel says the army has been defending the border. The army accuses Hamas of using the large crowds as cover and encouraging demonstrators to hurl explosives, incendiary balloons and grenades across the border. But Israel has come under heavy international criticism for the large number of unarmed people who have been harmed.

Egypt has repeatedly tried to broker a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, stepping up efforts in recent days after a Gaza rocket struck a house in central Israel earlier this week, injuring seven Israelis and threatening renewed escalation.

RABAT, Morocco (AP) — The Latest on the Pope’s trip to Morocco (all times local):

6 p.m.

Pope Francis and Moroccan King Mohammed VI are calling for Jerusalem to be preserved as a symbol of peaceful coexistence and for Muslims, Jews and Christians to be allowed to worship there freely.

The two leaders issued a joint appeal on Saturday as Francis arrived in the Moroccan capital Rabat for an overnight visit.

The appeal said it was important to preserve the Holy City “as the common patrimony of humanity and especially the followers of the three monotheistic religions, as a place of encounter and as a symbol of peaceful coexistence, where mutual respect and dialogue can be cultivated.”

Tensions erupted in late February over Israel’s closure of a building at a flashpoint Jerusalem holy site, revered by Jews as the Temple Mount and by Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary.

The walled compound, home to the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the golden Dome of the Rock, is the third-holiest site in Islam and the holiest site of Judaism.

5:15 p.m.

Morocco’s King Mohammed VI is calling for more religious dialogue between Muslims and Christians and says education is the answer to religious extremism.

Greeting Pope Francis on the pontiff’s first visit to Morocco on Saturday, the king said challenging times are facing the world’s religious community and require dialogue “for the sake of the future and that of the coming generations.”

Reading segments of his speech in Arabic, French, Spanish and English, the king said: “We need to tackle these new ills, which feed on treachery as much as on the instrumentalization of the divine message. What all terrorists have in common is not religion but rather ignorance of religion.”

Morocco has sought to become a voice of moderate Islam in the Muslim world.

5 p.m.

Pope Francis is urging Morocco to continue offering migrants welcome and protection, saying at the start of a visit to the North African kingdom that the global migration crisis cannot be resolved by building walls, spreading fear or denying aid.

Francis arrived Saturday in Rabat, the capital of Morocco, which last year became the main destination for sub-Saharan African migrants seeking to reach Europe.

In a speech at the Hassan Tour complex, where two of Morocco’s monarchs are buried, Francis told King Mohamed VI and government officials that he hoped Morocco would continue to be a model of humanity, welcome and protection for migrants seeking a better life.

He said: “The issue of migration will never be resolved by raising barriers, fomenting fear of others or denying assistance to those who legitimately aspire to a better life for themselves and their families.”

4:30 p.m.

Moroccan security agents have tackled a man who broke though security and ran toward King Mohammed VI as he and Pope Francis greeted crowds during an in-tandem motorcade parade in the Moroccan capital.

The man didn’t reach the king, who seemed not to notice the disturbance on Saturday. The man appeared to be waving an envelope as he tried to snake his way between the motorcade vehicles before being tackled. His fate was unknown.

The incident occurred as the king was escorting Francis to the Hassan Tower complex for a formal welcome ceremony.

Francis is in Morocco for a quick trip to boost Christian-Muslim ties and show solidarity with the country’s growing migrant community.

___

3:40 p.m.

Pope Francis is praising Morocco’s efforts to promote an Islam that repudiates extremism as he opens a quick trip to the North African kingdom that has tried to distinguish itself as a beacon of religious tolerance and moderation in the Muslim world.

King Mohamed VI welcomed Francis on Saturday as the pope began a visit aimed at encouraging Christian-Muslim ties and showing solidarity with Morocco’s ever-growing migrant community.

In a speech to the king and Moroccan authorities at the Hassan Tower complex, Francis said it was “essential” for all believers to counter religious fanaticism and extremism with solidarity. He called religious extremism “an offense against religion and against God himself.”

Later Saturday Francis is heading to a migrant welcome center run by the Caritas Catholic charity.

Pope Francis has arrived in Morocco for a trip aimed at highlighting the North African nation’s tradition of Christian-Muslim ties, while also letting him show solidarity with migrants at Europe’s door and tend to a tiny Catholic flock.

Francis will address the first two items Saturday, and the third when he wraps up the visit with a Mass and a meeting with Moroccan clergy on Sunday.

Moroccan King Mohammed VI was on hand to greet Francis when he landed under a pouring rain in Rabat, the Moroccan capital, for a 27-hour visit.

The highlight of the trip is likely to be Francis’ visit Saturday to the Mohammed VI Institute, a school of learning for imams that epitomizes Morocco’s efforts to promote a moderate brand of Islam and export it via preachers to Africa, the Middle East and Europe.

Pope Francis’s weekend trip to Morocco aims to highlight the North African nation’s tradition of Christian-Muslim ties while also letting him show solidarity with migrants at Europe’s door and tend to a tiny Catholic flock on the peripheries.

Francis will address the first two items on the agenda Saturday when he begins his 27-hour visit to Rabat, the Moroccan capital. He’ll tend to the third when he wraps up the visit with a Mass and a meeting with Moroccan clergy on Sunday.

The highlight of the trip is likely to be Francis’ visit Saturday to the Mohammed VI Institute, a school of learning for imams that epitomizes Morocco’s efforts to promote a moderate brand of Islam and export it via preachers to Africa, the Middle East and Europe.

Morocco, a Sunni Muslim kingdom of 36 million, reformed its religious policies and education to limit the spread of fundamentalism in 2004, following terrorist bombings in Casablanca that killed 43 people.


New York City officials are forking over an additional $1.6 million to city public defenders to represent illegal aliens who are facing deportation, officials announced Thursday.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and New York City Council Speaker Corey Johnson agreed Thursday to provide the extra $1.6 million towards the New York Immigrant Family Unity Project (NYIFUP), a city government-funded program that supports lawyers defending illegal aliens going through deportation proceedings.

The $1.6 million funding allocation is on top of the $10 million the city already set aside for these lawyers. New York City’s public defenders, however, advocated for $6.6 million in additional funding to address the backlog of illegal alien deportation cases, the New York Daily News reported.

“This emergency funding will help us provide more attorneys to New Yorkers in need,” Johnson said, adding:

This is crucial right now as the ICE deportation machine has ramped up efforts to interfere with the necessary work NYIFUP is doing by pushing people through the system with zero regard for due process. I will continue to fight these un-American and horrific immigration policies.

Illegal aliens who face deportation proceedings do not have a right to a taxpayer-funded public defender in U.S. courts.

Non-profit legal organizations throughout the country often represent illegal aliens going through the deportation process, but de Blasio and other New York City officials used city taxpayer funds for public defenders representing illegal aliens.

“While the Trump Administration continues to demonize immigrants, we know that their contributions are part of what makes our city great,” said Mayor de Blasio. “We are proud to help provide desperately needed legal representation in the face of punitive federal policies.”

Other blue states, such as California, have established similar programs where taxpayer money is used for lawyers who defend illegal aliens in court. In 2017, former California Gov. Jerry Brown proposed using $15 million in taxpayer funds to defend illegal aliens in deportation proceedings.


Paris (AFP) – Saracens hammered Glasgow 56-27 and Munster claimed a tight 17-13 victory over Edinburgh on Saturday to secure a Champions Cup semi-final meeting between the two European heavyweights.

Despite Ali Price’s first minute try for Glasgow, the English side, champions in 2016 and 2017, claimed half a dozen unanswered tries in the space of an hour for a sixth European semi-final spot in seven seasons.

Wales full-back Liam Williams and England winger David Strettle both dotted down for two touchdowns each for Sarries who played without international fly-half Owen Farrell who pulled out of the match three hours before kick-off due to his wife going into labour.

“I’m very lucky I have a great team around me, the boys didn’t blink and didn’t show any nerves or worries around me,” Farrell’s replacement at stand-off Alex Goode told BT Sport.

“We’ve played them in the semi-finals before, we know what a great side they are, they have a lot of physicality, a lot of passion and they’ve played very well today to come through,” Goode added about the Irish province.

Ireland’s Keith Earls scored twice for 2006 and 2008 champions Munster either side of the break in the Scottish capital to secure a 14th last-four appearance as they look for their first title in nine years.

“It’s our third semi-final in a row and this was a big win for us. Just look at the history of European rugby, you don’t come away with away quarter-final wins,” said head coach Johann Van Graan.

His team’s win was only the 20th occasion in 90 matches that the away side had claimed a quarter-final victory on the road.

“Munster never seem to do it the easy way and we certainly didn’t do that today,” the South African added.

Saracens will host Munster at Coventry’s Ricoh Arena on the weekend of April 20/21.

Defending champions Leinster welcome Ulster in the third quarter-final later Saturday before an all-French affair between Racing92 and Toulouse on Sunday.


Empire actor Jussie Smollett didn’t win an NAACP Image Award this weekend, capping off a chaotic week where the star had felony charges against him dropped by Cook County prosecutors.

According to Deadline, Jussie Smollett, who was up for an Outstanding Supporting Actor award, was snubbed for Grey’s Anatomy actor Jesse Williams.

The controversial Empire actor, who recently saw hate hoax charges dropped against him in a decision that roiled politicians and the media, lost to fellow nominee Jesse Williams of Grey’s Anatomy in the Outstanding Supporting Actor category in the non-televised portion of the awards on Friday, according to ABC News.

Smollett reportedly did not attend the award ceremony Friday.

Anthony Anderson, the host of the NAACP Image Awards, previously said that he wished for Smollett to win.

“I hope he wins. I’m happy for him that the system worked for him in his favor because the system isn’t always fair, especially for people of color,” the Black-ish star said.

“It’s not my place or any other person’s place to judge him or what not, but I’m glad [that] he’s nominated…I hope he wins because I’d be interested to hear his speech.”

Smollett was charged last month with 16 felony counts after he allegedly staged a fake racist attack against himself. On Tuesday, all charges against him were dropped.

Following the charges being dropped, Smollett told the public that he was still going to “fight for the justice, equality, and betterment of marginalized people everywhere.”

President Trump sounded off on the situation this week, calling it “an embarrassment to our Nation.”

The NAACP Image Awards will air live on TV One, Saturday night from the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, CA.


President Donald Trump ripped into Chicago prosecutors for dropping 16 felony charges against Jussie Smollett after he allegedly staged a fake attack against himself, calling it a “terrible situation.”

“Despite all that we’ve been forced to endure every day, we are working, and fighting, and winning. Remember that. Because we are making America great again, and we’re making it great for all Americans, all Americans,” Trump said during a rally Thursday in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

“And it’s getting to be that time. Very important–MAGA country–you heard the other day? How about in Chicago?” he continued.

“He said, he said, he was attacked by ‘MAGA country.’ Ever hear that one? Maybe the only time I’ve ever agreed with the mayor of Chicago right there. That’s a terrible situation. That’s an embarrassment not only to Chicago, that is an embarrassment to our country, what took place there. Remember that.”

Jussie Smollett, star of the Fox show Empire, was arrested last month on 16 felony counts after he allegedly paid two Nigerian-American men to beat him in a fake racist attack.

The 36-year-old claimed that two Trump supporters attacked him, put a rope around his neck, poured a chemical on him, abused him with racist and homophobic slurs, and yelled “This is MAGA country!” in downtown Chicago in January.

Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel (D) expressed indignation at the charges being dropped, saying in a press conference this week, “This is a whitewash of justice.”

“Mr. Smollett is still saying that he is innocent, still running down the Chicago police department. How dare him? How dare him? After everybody saw––and I want to remind you, this is not the superintendent’s word against his. The grand jury, a sliver of the evidence, and they came to a conclusion as did the state attorney’s office,” Emanuel said.

“This is not the superintendent and the detectives’ department word against his. And even after this whitewash, there is still no sense of ownership of what he’s done. He says that, in fact, he is the wronged in this case. This is an unbelievable not just whitewash of justice. This is a person now who has not been let off scot-free with no sense of accountability of the moral and ethical wrong of his actions from top to bottom.”


Ratings for the FOX drama Empire crashed to an all-time low on Wednesday following the abrupt decision by the Cook County prosecutor to drop all charges against the show’s embattled star Jussie Smollett.

According to TVLine, Wednesday night’s episode of Empire dropped to 3.97 million viewers. This all-time low follows last week’s low performance of only 4 million total viewers.

The ratings for the Fox drama have been in a free fall since Smollett allegedly planned a hoax attack against himself. Two weeks ago, the show’s fifth season debut episode dropped 35 percent in the ratings compared to last year.

Jussie Smollett, the star of Empire, was charged with 16 felony counts last month after Chicago police came to believe that he orchestrated a hate crime attack against himself in January, paying two Nigerian-American men to pose as racist, homophobic Trump supporters, beat him, put a rope around his neck, and yell “MAGA country!”

The charges were dropped by prosecutors Tuesday, and Smollett will face no punishment as he already performed a whole 18 hours of community service with Jesse Jackson’s Rainbow PUSH Coalition.

However, despite Smollett escaping justice from Cook County prosecutors he is still being investigated by the FBI for mail fraud.

The 36-year-old is also likely to be fired from Empire, according to a new report.


Actor George Clooney is calling for a boycott of hotels in Brunei, as well as hotels owned by companies based in the country, over new laws making homosexuality and adultery crimes punishable by death.

“On this particular April 3rd, the nation of Brunei will begin stoning and whipping to death any of its citizens that are proved to be gay. Let that sink in. In the onslaught of news where we see the world backsliding into authoritarianism this stands alone,” Clooney said in a public statement, according to the Hill.

Brunei, situated on the island of Borneo off the coast of Vietnam, recently announced a turn toward a stricter observance of Sharia law, which includes stoning and amputations for violations. Homosexuality was already punishable by ten years in prison, but now that penalty has been increased in some cases.

Brunei is set to become the first Asian country to punish homosexuality with the death penalty, mirroring the same harsh penalties seen in many Arab countries.

As Breitbart News reported, “the sultanate disregarded five years of criticism from international human rights groups and quietly issued court orders to proceed with Stage Two on April 3. Gays will be whipped, imprisoned for much longer sentences, and could be executed by stoning, although Brunei has recently been lax about actually carrying out death sentences.”

Clooney went on to recognize the “spectacular hotels” run by Brunei-based Brunei Investment Agency and called for a boycott of the facilities over the new laws.

“But let’s be clear,” Clooney wrote, “every single time we stay at or take meetings at or dine at any of these nine hotels we are putting money directly into the pockets of men who choose to stone and whip to death their own citizens for being gay or accused of adultery.”

“Are we really going to help pay for these human rights violations? Are we really going to help fund the murder of innocent citizens?” Clooney asked.

Clooney concluded saying that supporters can help push the country to change its laws by putting pressure on its finances.

“I’ve learned over years of dealing with murderous regimes that you can’t shame them. But you can shame the banks, the financiers and the institutions that do business with them and choose to look the other way,” Clooney concluded.

A new report reveals that left-wing Hollywood stars like Amy Schumer are being flat-out rejected by New York City waitresses over a pending minimum wage increase the workers believe will hurt more than help.

In a New York Times article titled, “Amy Schumer, Amy Poehler and Other Stars Stand Up for Waitresses. The Response: No, Thanks.,” it’s revealed that stars are pushing for New York State’s minimum wage law to apply to service industry workers who rely on tips to make a living.

The group of female actresses-turned-activists, which also includes Sarah Jessica Parker and Michelle Williams, are pushing for this change as they believe it would reduce sexual harassment in the workplace.

But the Times piece reports that working women in New York would rather have the Hollywood elites “butt out.”

“The resounding message from servers in New York to these actresses in Hollywood is to just leave us alone,” said Maggie Raczynski, a bartender at an Outback Steakhouse in upstate New York. “These celebrities have literally no idea. I feel like they need to butt out.” … An aspiring young actress who has worked as a waitress in a Manhattan restaurant for the last three years said she worried that restaurants would raise menu prices and switch to a nontipping model if they had to pay servers $15 an hour. The actress, who just landed a role in an independent horror film but declined to be identified to avoid upsetting her employer, said she would not continue as a waitress without the chance to earn tips.

Indeed, when tips are factored in, many servers earn far more than the minimum wage of $11.10 in New York State, or $15 in New York City.

Other Hollywood stars have gotten in on the cause, including actresses Natalie Portman and Debra Messing, who recently signed a letter calling for minimum wage to apply to waiters and waitresses.

“A subminimum wage for a predominantly female workforce is linked to high rates of sexual harassment in the restaurant industry and prevents thousands of working women from achieving economic security,” their letter read in part.

A group of hundreds of servers across New York and other states responded by signing a letter from the Restaurant Workers of America which rebuffs the stars’ offer for “help.”

“To the celebrity women who recently criticized the full-service restaurant industry, from over 500

women and men who work in it: Thank you for your concern. But we don’t need your help, and we’re

not asking to be saved,” the letter states.

The letter also calls out Hollywood for their own sexual harassment problem.

“Bad behavior happens in every industry—Hollywood celebrities should know better than most that

sexual harassment happens everywhere. The people who are pushing for this change in the restaurant

industry are exploiting the isolated stories of people that have suffered injustices, and making it out

to be the industry’s or the tipping system’s fault. That is just not true.”

“We respect your profession, and now it’s time for you to respect ours,” the letter concludes.


Disgraced Empire star Jussie Smollett poses as a left-wing Social Justice Warrior (SJW) even as he throws two innocent black men under the wheels of the criminal justice system.

The Osundairo Brothers, Abel and Ola are not completely innocent. Their attorney has already admitted both were willing participants in Smollett’s obscene plan to stage a hate crime hoax. It was their job to perform the attack while wearing ski masks and red baseball caps so Smollett could blame the assault on white, racist, homophobic Trump supporters.

So, no, they are not completely innocent.

They are, however, innocent of a much more serious crime, a crime that could result in substantial prison time, and that is the crime of committing a hate crime and physical assault.

And although they are both innocent of that crime, Smollett is still accusing them of committing it.

In other words, as a means to save his own sorry ass and career, Smollett is willing to allow two innocent black men to stand accused of a crime he knows they did not commit.

By any civilized measure, Smollett is no better than the racist cops his fellow SJW’s rail against.

In his statement Tuesday, just after the corrupt Cook County State Attorney dropped all charges and sealed the record of the 16 felony counts pending against him, he immediately fed the Osundairo Brothers to the wolves:

BREAKING: Jussie Smollett speaks after all charges were dropped: "I have been truthful and consistent on every single level since day one. I would not be my mother's son if I was capable of one drop of what I have been accused of." https://t.co/B2ahaJAW4t pic.twitter.com/0bgEBJFN33 — ABC News (@ABC) March 26, 2019

I have been truthful and consistent on every single level since day one. I would not be my mother’s son if I was capable of one drop of what I’ve been accused of. This has been an incredibly difficult time and, honestly, one of the worst of my entire life. … Make no mistake, I will always continue to fight for the justice, inequality, and betterment of marginalized people everywhere.

As you can see, he wants the whole world to believe a couple of desperate wannabe actors, two black men, are guilty of hurling racist and homophobic slurs, beating him up, wrapping a noose around his neck, and pouring bleach on his black skin.

When Smollett says he has “been truthful and consistent on every single level since day one” that’s what he’s saying — that these two black Trump supporters deserve ten years in prison.

If that’s not outrageous enough for you, watch Smollett’s attorney say she has noooooo possible idea what the brothers’ motive could have been…

Jussie Smollett's attorney, Patricia Browne Holmes, today said the Nigerian brothers committed the hate crime against her client. Tonight she said she has "no idea" what their motive could have been. Insane how they're willing to use these two brothers as fall guys. pic.twitter.com/6Qf40Wxy6L — Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) March 27, 2019

During a Thursday interview, Smollett’s attorney accused the brothers of wearing whiteface to explain why Smollett told police his attackers were white:

When [Jussie] learned it was the [brothers who attacked him] once they were in custody, Glandian said, Smollett ‘found it hard to believe’ because he had told that he could make out one had ‘pale or white skin’ around his eyes beneath the ski mask he was wearing. It was not a lie, she insisted, adding that the reason for it could have been that the brothers were in ‘disguise’. ‘He did tell police that from what he saw, he thought it was white or pale skin, that’s what he initially said. ‘Obviously, you can disguise that. You can put make-up on,’ she said. She went on to point to a 2016 YouTube video of Abel Osundairo, the brother in question, where he is wearing white make-up to perform a Joker monologue as potential proof of her theory.

The famous and wealthy and politically connected Smollett stands before the world on behalf of justice! and inequality! and marginalized people! as he falsely accuses two innocent black guys of committing a crime he invented and orchestrated.

When it comes to being a TV star, black lives suddenly don’t matter all that much to this guy.

Jussie Smollett is a monster.

“He at this point again has been victimized much more by what’s happened afterwards than what happened that night.”

A partial transcript is as follows:

SAVANNAH GUTHRIE: According to the court records he — Smollett — was very clear with police on the night of the attack that his attackers were white. He said they had masks on and gloves, but he saw their eyes, that he saw the skin surrounding their eyes was white. Was that a false statement?

TINA GLANDIAN: So, just to be clear: He only saw one of the attackers. One of them he didn’t see. He saw one through a ski mask. Again, he could not see their body. Everything was covered, and he had a full ski mask on except the area around the eyes. He did tell police that he — from what we saw, he thought it was pale skin or white or pale skin, was I think what he said. And that was what he — and that’s why he initially did have a hard time.

GUTHRIE: Why did he say that? He could have said, “I don’t know.”

GLANDIAN: He could have.

GUTHRIE: But with the Osundairo brothers, what are the chances that was the case that he saw somebody with white skin?

GLANDIAN: Well, you know, I mean, I think there’s — obviously, you can disguise that. You can put makeup on. There is, interestingly enough, a video. You know, I think police had minimal investigation in this case, it took me only five minutes to Google. You know, I was looking up the brothers, and one of the videos that showed up actually was of the brothers in whiteface doing a joker monologue with white makeup on him. So, it’s not — it’s not implausible.


Actress Bette Midler attacked Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) over his staunch support for President Donald Trump’s agenda, describing Graham as a “Little Mermaid” with no spine.

Graham, who was a fierce critic of Donald Trump and refused to endorse him in the 2016 presidential election, said earlier this week he was grateful to the president for meeting with him over major policy objectives such as immigration and Syria.

“Lindsey Graham says: ‘President Trump has been good to me in the sense that he’s allowed me in his world,'” Midler said. “Is he kidding? I’d call him Little Mermaid, but Mermaids have spines!”

Midler has repeatedly attacked Graham. Last November, she complained about Graham’s supposedly inadequate response to Trump’s firing of Attorney General Jeff Session’s, after he previously declared that there would be “holy hell to pay” if Trump were to do so.

#LIndsey?? @LindseyGrahamSC ? Are you there?? Come on Lindsey, we're waiting to hear from you! Here, in 2017, you said there'd be holy hell to pay if Sessions were fired…Where's the holy hell, huh??

The 72-year-old actress remains one of Hollywood’s most fervent anti-Trump fanatics. Last year, she even fantasized about seeing Trump and his family hanged “good and high” should he be found guilty by FBI Special Counsel Robert Mueller of colluding with Russia during his election campaign.

Last Sunday, Mueller concluded that there was no evidence that Trump or his campaign associates were guilty of any wrongdoing, despite receiving “multiple offers” of assistance from Russian agents or intermediaries.

Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, whose office is under fire after dropping all charges against Empire actor Jussie Smollett, recently attended at a fundraiser hosted by Alex Soros, the son of progressive billionaire George Soros, who donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to a super PAC that supported her.

Foxx spoke at a fundraiser for the Justice and Public Safety PAC hosted at the New York apartment of Alex Soros on March 5th, roughly three weeks prior to Smollett being let off the hook for allegedly staging a racist and homophobic attack on himself, according to photos shared to social media.

Thank you to all who attended our #JusticeandPublicSafety PAC fundraiser! pic.twitter.com/jkiaLgdzGj — Alexander Soros, PhD (@AlexanderSoros) March 6, 2019

As Breitbart News reported Tuesday, state campaign records show that George Soros personally donated $333,000 to a PAC supporting Foxx, who was running against incumbent top prosecutor Anita Alvarez, prior to the March 15h, 2016 primary. The far-left hedge fund manager also contributed another $75,000 after Foxx won, bringing the total to $408,000.

Chicagoist.com reported in 2016:

But Kim Foxx has also found two other sources of cash, in the form of twin $300,000 donations to a Super PAC supporting her called Illinois Safety & Justice. The sole donors to the PAC are neoliberal superdonor and conservative-boogeyman George Soros and a “dark-money” group called Civic Participation Action Fund. A Super PAC is a fundraising group, created by the 2010 Supreme Court Citizens United decision, that can raise as much money as they want for any candidate or cause—as long as they don’t coordinate on any level with political campaigns, which have much smaller campaign limits.

Since the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2014, George Soros has backed progressive candidates in local prosecutorial races across the U.S. to the tune of millions of dollars.

Cook County prosecutors infuriated the Chicago Police Department and Mayor Rahm Emanuel this week when they abruptly dropped 16 felony counts that accused Smollett of making a false police report about being the target of a racist, anti-gay attack in downtown Chicago on January 29. Contrary to publicly announcing her recusal from the Smollett case, Cook County State’s Attorney Office spokesperson confirmed this week that Foxx did not “formally” recuse herself, doing so only in a “colloquial” manner. Foxx “recused” herself before Smollett was charged because she had discussed the case with a Smollett family member. The case was then handed to First Assistant State’s Attorney Joseph Magats.

On Wednesday, the ex-chief of staff for former first lady Michelle Obama admitted she approached Foxx regarding the case on behalf of the actor’s family. Tina Tchen released a statement saying she’s a friend of Smollett’s family and knows Foxx “from prior work together.” Tchen said her “sole activity” was to put the prosecutor in touch with “an alleged victim’s family.” Tchen said the Smollett family “had concerns about how the investigation was being characterized in public.”

Email and text messages that Foxx’s office provided to the Chicago Sun-Times show Tchen contacted Foxx to set up a telephone conversation with the Smollett relative. Foxx told the Sun-Times the relative expressed concerns over leaked information.

Investigators believe Smollett, who is black and gay, hired two brothers to stage the attack in and that Smollett hoped the attention would help advance his career. Police also allege that before the attack, Smollett sent a letter threatening himself to the Chicago television studio where Empire is filmed.

Smollett has repeatedly insisted the attack was real, saying two masked men shouted racial and homophobic slurs, wrapped a rope around his neck and poured a substance on him. He also told detectives that the attackers yelled that he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan, police said.

President Donald Trump tweeted Thursday that the FBI and Department of Justice will review the “outrageous” case of Jussie Smollett in Chicago, calling it an “embarrassment” to the country.

FBI & DOJ to review the outrageous Jussie Smollett case in Chicago. It is an embarrassment to our Nation! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 28, 2019

A city official said Thursday that Chicago is seeking $130,000 from Smollett to cover the costs of the investigation into his reported beating.

The Associated Press contributed to this report.


A group of elite Hollywood celebrities from Alec Baldwin to Sarah Silverman have signed a letter written by Alyssa Milano threatening to boycott the state of Georgia over a proposed law banning abortions after a heartbeat is detected.

The bill, H.B. 481, which has not yet been passed by the Georgia House, seeks to outlaw abortions that take place after about six weeks.

If the bill does pass, some of Hollywood’s biggest stars are joining forces to crush the state under a boycott campaign.

Deadline reports:

With “Hollywood” the industry so often stretching well beyond “Hollywood” the town – especially given that stretching increasingly reaches Georgia – about 50 actors including Amy Schumer, Amber Tamblyn, Alec Baldwin, Don Cheadle, Rosie O’Donnell, Patton Oswalt, Sarah Silverman, Essence Atkins, Uzo Aduba, Gabrielle Union, Christina Applegate, Ben Stiller, Sean Penn, David Cross, Mia Farrow, Colin Hanks and Bradley Whitford has signed a letter written by Alyssa Milano in opposition of the state’s so-called “heartbeat” anti-abortion bill. The letter was sent Thursday morning to Georgia House Speaker David Ralston and Georgia governor Brian Kemp, but has been circulating on social media all day.

The letter explicitly threatens Georgia lawmakers, reading, “We can’t imagine being elected officials who had to say to their constituents, ‘I enacted a law that was so evil, it chased billions of dollars out of our state’s economy.’ It’s not the most effective campaign slogan, but rest assured we’ll make it yours should it come to pass.”

“We want to stay in Georgia. We want to continue to support the wonderful people, businesses, and communities we have come to love in the Peach State,” the letter also states.

“But we will not do so silently, and we will do everything in our power to move our industry to a safer state for women if H.B. 481 becomes law.”

Alyssa Milano, the celebrity activist who spearheaded this effort, said in a social media post that Hollywood should “stop feeding” Georgia’s economy if they passed the heartbeat bill.

There are over 20 productions shooting in GA & the state just voted to strip women of their bodily autonomy. Hollywood!

The Writers Guild of America East (WGAE) and the Writers Guild of America West (WGAWest) also joined in on the effort, stating, “This draconian anti-choice law would discourage people in our industry from working in Georgia and could harm the state’s vibrant film and television industry.”

The boycott tactic has been used before against states that run afoul of Hollywood’s morality. In 2016, high-profile artists from Bruce Springsteen to Ringo Starr participated in a boycott effort against North Carolina to punish the state for passing a transgender “bathroom bill.”


CHICAGO (AP) — A city official says Chicago is seeking $130,000 from “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett to cover the costs of the investigation into his reported beating, which police say was staged.

Bill McCaffrey, a spokesman for the city government’s legal department, confirmed the amount Thursday, hours after Mayor Rahm Emanuel said the city would try to recoup the money it spent on the investigation.

Cook County prosecutors on Tuesday dropped all of the charges against Smollett, who was accused of lying to police about being the victim of a homophobic and racist attack in downtown Chicago on Jan. 29.

Emanuel and the police department blasted the decision to drop the charges, saying they stand by their belief that Smollett hired two friends to help him stage the attack because he was unhappy about his salary and wanted publicity.

Smollett has maintained throughout that he is innocent.


IL state Rep. Michael McAuliffe says he's introducing legislation to kill tax credits to productions that hire Jussie Smollett: “I feel…someone like Jussie Smollett or someone else that would commit the same kind of act should not benefit from this generous, robust tax credit" pic.twitter.com/L5QgLvpTye

A partial transcript is as follows:

BRIANNA KEILAR: Do you agree with the president that the FBI and the DOJ need to review the [Jussie Smollett] case?

MICHAEL MCAULIFFE: Well, that’s his prerogative as our chief officer, but I’m here to talk about the legislation that I plan on filing tomorrow.

BRIANNA KEILAR: Okay. In that legislation you have is to withhold state film tax credits from any production that employs Smollett. I certainly understand that you feel you have a lot of support. I know the area you represent, there are a lot of police officers there and I’m sure they are making their opinions known to you. I know you and they feel the legal system has failed to do its job, right? Is this the way to get around that? I mean, it’s a pretty unprecedented move that you’re making, so explain this to us and tell us why this is the proper route to take, in your opinion?

MICHAEL MCAULIFFE: Okay, let’s go through the story. Two months ago, in a cold winter night when mostly all Chicagoans were at home for many days watching on T.V., we saw how [Jussie] Smollett said that he was a victim. As it turns out through the police, the hard work of the men and women of the Chicago Police Department that get a very bad wrap, a lot because of the violence here in Chicago. This perpetrator, or [Jussie] Smollett, did a hoax. Pretended he was a victim, orchestrated this whole hoax. We lost many, many hours of man power, man time, overtime, on over cases police could be investigating like murders and shootings, and this went on for two months. Also, it made Chicago the laughing stock of the nation because not only was it a hoax crime, it was a hate crime.

The General Assembly gives a robust tax credit to any production company that plans on filming T.V. shows or movies. And I feel, and I feel a lot of Chicagoans feel, someone like [Jussie] Smollett or someone else that would commit the same kind of act should not benefit from this generous, robust tax credit.


Appearing Thursday morning on WGN Radio, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel revealed the Chicago Police Department will seek to recover the money spent on investigating the alleged hate hoax carried out by Empire actor Jussie Smollett.

“The police are right now finalizing the cost that was used, police resources to come to the understanding this was a hoax and not a real hate crime,” said Emanuel. “What we spent. The corporation counsel, once they have the finalized and feel good about the numbers, will then send a letter to Jussie Smollett and his attorneys, trying to recoup those costs for the city.”

The mayor said Smollett repaying the money spent would an admission of “guilt” and funds the Chicago taxpayers deserve to see returned to the city’s coffers.

“It is a small way of both acknowledging, one, guilt, two, that we spent these resources and the taxpayers deserve, at minimum — because I think there’s a whole other level of ethical costs, because he’s still walking around, ‘Hey, I’m innocent, everything I said from day one is true’ — that actually we’re going to get the resources back,” he said. “But come with those resources is, implicitly, if you pay it, that the city spent money to uncover what the grand jury discovered.”

Emanuel also asked that President Donald Trump “just sit this one out,” following a tweet in which the president stated he would direct the FBI to look into why Cook County prosecutors dropped all charges against Smollett.

Prosecutors have offered little explanation and infuriated Chicago’s police chief and mayor this week when they dropped 16 felony counts against Smollett related to making a false police report, yet still insisted the actor faked a racist, anti-gay attack on himself in January.

The two brothers who claim they worked with the actor to stage the January attack are lying, according to Smollett attorney Tina Glandian. She said Smollett, who is black and gay, had hired one brother as a personal trainer but had no idea who attacked him along a Chicago street until the brothers were later identified by police.

Police said investigators believe Smollett hired the brothers to stage the early-morning Jan. 29 attack, and that Smollett hoped to gain attention to help advance his career. Police also allege that before the attack, Smollett sent a letter threatening himself to the Chicago television studio where Empire is shot. The FBI, which is investigating that letter, has declined to comment.

Smollett has repeatedly insisted the attack was real, saying two masked men used racial and homophobic slurs, wrapped a rope around his neck and poured an “unknown substance” on him. Police said Smollett also told detectives the attackers yelled he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan.

Prosecutors initially charged Smollett with one felony count, in February. Then earlier this month, a grand jury indicted him on 15 more counts.

In a stunning reversal Tuesday, the Cook County state’s attorney’s office abruptly dropped all charges against Smollett, abandoning the criminal case only five weeks after the allegations were filed.

In return, prosecutors said, the actor agreed to let the city keep his $10,000 in bail. The dismissal drew a backlash and raised the question of why Smollett was not forced to admit any wrongdoing.

The Associated Press contributed to this report.


A press release from the National District Attorneys Association (NDAA) calls out Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx for her role in felony charges against Jussie Smollett being dropped this week.

Empire actor Jussie Smollett was charged last month with 16 felony counts after he allegedly staged a hate crime against himself, paying two Nigerian-American brothers to beat him in a hoax attack. On Tuesday, the charges were suddenly dropped by SA Kim Foxx, infuriating Chicago police.

The NDAA criticized Foxx for a variety of reasons.

First, when a chief prosecutor recuses him or herself, the recusal must apply to the entire office, not just the elected or appointed prosecutor. This is consistent with best practices for prosecutors’ offices around the country. Second, prosecutors should not take advice from politically connected friends of the accused. Each case should be approached with the goal of justice for victims while protecting the rights of the defendant. Third, when a prosecutor seeks to resolve a case through diversion or some other alternative to

prosecution, it should be done so with an acknowledgement of culpability on the part of the

defendant. A case with the consequential effects of Mr. Smollett’s should not be resolved without a finding of guilt or innocence.

“(T)he rich are treated differently, the politically connected receive favorable treatment, and Lady Justice sometimes peeks under her blindfold to see who stands before her,” the release reads in part.

Part of the reason the charges against Smollett were dropped was because of his community service, which apparently means 18 hours of volunteering with Jesse Jackson’s organization, the “Rainbow PUSH Coalition.” This community service took place before the charges were dropped.

Foxx also did not in fact “formally” recuse herself, despite the earlier announcement that she had done so. The recusal was “colloquial,” not legal.

The 36-year-old actor originally claimed that two men jumped in downtown Chicago in January at 2am, put a rope around his neck, poured a chemical on him, and called him racist and homophobic slurs. The “attackers” also allegedly yelled “This is MAGA country!”


PARIS (AP) – French yellow vest protesters are rallying to support an activist injured in a confrontation with police.

The demonstrators are undeterred by protest bans or repeated injuries in 20 weeks of demonstrations. So they’re marching again Saturday in Paris, Bordeaux and other cities to keep pressing President Emmanuel Macron to do more to help the working classes, redesign French politics – or step down altogether.

They’re also showing solidarity with Genevieve Legay, a 73-year-old anti-globalization activist who suffered a head injury in the southern city of Nice last weekend. The Nice prosecutor said a police officer pushed her down.

“We are all Genevieve!” read an online appeal for Saturday’s protests.

The main Paris protest will start to weave through the Left Bank and past the Eiffel Tower. Protests are banned around the Champs-Elysees, scene of recent rioting.

The ongoing border crisis forced Border Patrol officials to implement a massive catch and release program where most migrants illegally crossing the border are released shortly after being processed. The policy comes as Border Patrol officials estimate that more than 100,000 migrants will be apprehended in March.

Border Patrol officials in multiple sectors announced a policy this week to being releasing thousands of migrants on their own recognizance shortly after they are apprehended at the border. The move comes in response to the massive increase of illegal border crossings by migrant families from Central America.

“This demographic is challenging in that they cannot be immediately returned to their country of origin,” Del Rio Sector Border Patrol officials stated. “U.S. Border Patrol processing centers are not designed to house the current numbers of families and small children that we are encountering.”

During a press conference late this week, Yuma Sector Deputy Chief Patrol Agent Carl Landrum announced a similar policy for his Arizona sector. He blamed the dramatic surge in migrant families and minors that are overwhelming his sector’s agents and resources.

“Due to capacity issues at our stations and the ongoing humanitarian crisis nationwide, Border Patrol has begun identifying detainees for potential release in Yuma with a notice to appear for their immigration hearings,” Yuma Sector officials said in a written statement.

Landrum said his sector is on pace to apprehend 60,000 migrants this fiscal year. He explained that this is the highest level since 2007 when constructions crews built border barriers that greatly reduced illegal border crossings in the Yuma Sector, AZCentral reported. The deputy chief said his sector has the capacity to hold about 400 migrants at a time.

The migrants being released reportedly have family members living in the U.S. and have cleared medical screening and criminal background checks, officials reported.

The same policy has also been implemented in the Rio Grande Valley Sector in South Texas where the largest number of migrant families and minors cross on a daily basis. Earlier this week, agents in this sector apprehended nearly 1,700 migrants in a single day, Breitbart News reported.

Hidalgo County, Texas, Sheriff Eddie Guerra says human smugglers are exploiting the current laws and advertising with pamphlets in Central America. “In Central American countries they have pamphlets and flyers that tell them, ‘Just Come to America! You will be processed and released, given an opportunity!” the sheriff said in an interview with KGBT.

During a speech at the Texas-Mexico border near El Paso, U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin K. McAleenan said, “On Monday, we saw the highest total of apprehensions and encounters in over a decade, with 4,000 migrants either apprehended or encountered at Ports of Entry in a single day. That was Monday.”

“Yesterday, we broke the record again with 4,117,” the commissioner stated. “We are now on pace for over 100 thousand apprehensions and encounters with migrants in March, with 90 percent of those, 90 thousand people, crossing the border illegally between Ports of Entry. March will be the highest month since 2008. The arriving flows are made up primarily of Central American families and unaccompanied children.”

“We have lost the ability to know who or what is coming across the border,” Border Patrol Agent Hector Garza told Fox & Friends during an interview on Thursday morning. The agent spoke to Fox News in his capacity as Vice President of the National Border Patrol Council.

“We don’t know who or what is coming across because now our agents are having to process these people, transport them, feed them, care for them, and now we can’t even do our job of border security,” the veteran Border Patrol agent stated. “That’s unacceptable.”

“Out of those 100,000 that are going to be coming in during the month of March, 90 percent are being released into the community.”

In an interview with Conservative Review, National Border Patrol Council President Brandon Judd said, “We have never seen what we are dealing with today. It’s unprecedented and we’re in uncharted waters.


A caravan migrant from Honduras who complained about being given beans to eat during her journey through Mexico is now in a Texas jail facing one charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. The woman became the topic of a viral video during her journey. The woman’s sister is also facing similar charges and both have an immigration detainer placed on them preventing them from bonding out.

Jail records from Dallas County jail revealed that Mirian Zelaya and Mirna Zelaya are both being held in a detention center on a charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. While jail records do not reveal the details that led to the charge, the news outlet Mundo Hispanico revealed that the two women allegedly beat another woman who was providing them with housing.

Mirian or Miriam Zelaya is a member of the much-publicized migrant caravan that traveled from Central America to the U.S. border. She became a viral sensation in Mexico in 2018 after she was interviewed at a migrant shelter in Tijuana on TV by the German network DW. During the interview, she complained about being given a plate of beans for food. The woman said she and her daughter were tired from the journey and had been given pig food or “comida de chanchos.”

The video of the interview rapidly turned viral in Mexico, earning Zelaya the nickname #LadyFrijoles or Lady Beans. The backlash by caravan protesters rapidly spread throughout Mexico leading to news outlets finding her again. Zelaya issued a public apology for her comments. Soon after Zelaya entered the U.S and moved to Dallas where her sister Mirna was already living.

Saturday on MSNBC’s “AM Joy,” former Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson acknowledged the severity of the crisis on the U.S.-Mexico border with regards to illegal immigration.

Johnson argued against sending unaccompanied minors back to without due process, but added that what was underway now was much worse than anything he dealt with as Obama’s Homeland Security secretary.

“The number you’re showing — I lived with them month by month, day by day,” Johnson said. “We had a crisis in 2014. It’s nowhere near the numbers you’re seeing now. There are ways to respond to this. One thing I would not do, which is [what] the secretary’s letter to Congress proposes is amending a law called the [Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA)] in a way to make it easier and faster to send unaccompanied kids back to Central America. We might be at the doorstep of another separating families at the border crisis, Joy.”

“The idea of sending a 7-year-old back to Central America without due process is something that most Americans should have a serious objection to,” he continued. “There are other ways to deal with this situation right now. As Kevin McAleenan, the commissioner of [Customs and Border Protection (CBP)], pointed out, on Tuesday, there were 4,000 apprehensions — one day alone, 4,000. We are on pace this month for 100,000 apprehensions. The highest we saw on my watch was May 2014, 65,000. So this is a crisis. It is very definitely a crisis. There are ways to deal with this. There are answers. There are no easy answers. The one thing we should not do as Americans is simply send a 7-year-old, an 8-year-old unaccompanied child back to Central America without due process.”

A CBS News poll shows that only 37 percent of Americans believe special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into the Russia collusion hoax was justified, while a majority of 54 percent believe it was “politically motivated.”

In a country as divided as this one, 54 percent of Americans agreeing on anything political is pretty impressive, and as Townhall points out, there has been a massive sea change in public perception of the Mueller investigation.

Just a couple of months ago, in January 2019, this same poll showed that only 45 percent believed the investigation was “politically motivated,” while 50 percent said it was “justified.”

In other words, those who believe the investigation was “justified” plummeted by 13 points, while those who believe it was “politically motivated” jumped nine points.

That’s a 22-point stampede in the other direction.

Naturally, the far-left CBS News, which, along with the rest of the establishment media, spent two years spreading the hoax about President Trump’s colluding with the Russians to steal the 2016 presidential election, buried these inconvenient findings below the numbers that push their agenda about the public wanting to see the Mueller Report — you know, as though that isn’t already going to happen.

Other numbers inconvenient to the fake media include the fact that only 38 percent of Americans want the investigations into Russia to continue by Democrats in Congress.

Only ten percent believe the Mueller investigation, which cleared the president entirely, was conducted unfairly.

Only 23 percent claim the investigation did not clear Trump, while 34 percent believe it has, and 36 percent believe it is too soon to say.

The CBS poll lines up pretty well with a recent Rasmussen poll that shows 61 percent of respondents want all congressional investigations against Trump to stop.

Whether Democrats and their allies in the fake news media want to acknowledge it or not, there was a pre-Mueller Report world and a post-Mueller Report world, and in this post-Mueller Report world, Trump is a duly elected president, a legitimate president, and one who was unfairly hounded, smeared, and harassed for two long years by a politically motivated/media-driven witch hunt.

With the 2020 presidential campaign about a year away from launching in earnest, Trump’s enemies would be wise to remember Bill Clinton’s 60 percent approval ratings during the Monica Lewinsky scandal.

Whatever you might think of Clinton as a man or president, he continued the Reagan-Bush era of peace and prosperity, and voters did not want that impeded over a personal indiscretion, even if it involved perjury.

Trump’s record is even more impressive, for he has delivered America into the first era of peace and prosperity in 17 long years, since September 11, 2001, and voters are not going to stand for any more of these hoaxes and fishing expeditions.

Two years of this nonsense are enough.

Prime Minister Theresa May has yet to give up on her thrice-defeated Withdrawal Agreement with the European Union, according to reports, and is attempting to organise a fourth parliamentary vote on it next week.

The Withdrawal Agreement was crushed by a record 230 votes when it was put to a so-called “meaningful vote” in the House of Commons in January, and by an only marginally less devastating 149 votes on a second attempt some weeks later.

The most recent vote on the Withdrawal Agreement, this time without its accompanying Political Declaration and therefore technically not another “meaningful vote”, according to the relevant parliamentary arcana, took place on March 29th — the date when Mrs May had promised 108 times that Britain would finally leave the European Union.

If the deal had passed, a Brexit on the terms it laid out should have taken place on May 22nd — but it was defeated yet again, by 58 votes.

In normal circumstances, this would be considered a heavy, possibly resignation-worthy defeat for a sitting Government, but in the current climate it is being interpreted almost in a positive light, with a Downing Street spokesman noting optimistically: “We are at least going in the right direction.”

Prior to the 2017 snap election which followed the 2016 referendum on Brexit, the Prime Minister pledged that “no deal is better than a bad deal” and, legally, the United Kingdom has now defaulted to a clean break with the EU on No Deal terms on April 12th, per the terms of the short deadline extension she was granted by the European Council.

However, while over 80 percent of MPs were elected on Brexit manifestos, the vast majority of them are former Remainers, and they have expressed their opposition to a No Deal exit in any circumstances.

It is therefore expected that Mrs May will try to secure a much longer Brexit delay at an emergency summit of the European Council on April 10th if Meaningful Vote 4, or MV4, is a non-starter — with reports indicating she will seek to put Brexit off by nine months.

Fmr. Bank of England Boss Mervyn King: No Deal Brexit Is the Answer, Project Fear Is a Myth https://t.co/Z5gF3QpzNK — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 29, 2019

Some members of the Cabinet are urging Mrs May to come back to “no deal is better than a bad deal” and embrace a clean exit on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms.

“The Remainers clearly want a customs union as an alternative but there isn’t a majority for that in the party — it would destroy the [Tory] party,” one ministerial source told The Telegraph.

“We would end up with a Ramsay MacDonald-esque government where we would be completely at odds with our own party,” referring to the first-ever Labour prime minister — who ultimately ended up having to govern with on behalf of the Tories, after losing the support of his own backbenchers.

“It’s time to be bold, we need to embrace No Deal.”

Govt Whistleblower: UK Prepared for ‘No Deal’ Brexit, Scare Stories ‘Absolutely Untrue’ https://t.co/FHVSSJBnua — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 29, 2018

Historians and constitutional experts have noted that Mrs May could stop MPs from preventing No Deal by calling on Queen Elizabeth II to prorogue — i.e. temporarily suspend — the parliamentary session, and simply waiting for No Deal to take effect as scheduled per the terms of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.

This would require a perhaps unlikely degree of resolve on the part of the Tory leader, however, almost certainly requiring her to remove a number of Cabinet ministers — most of whom are, like herself, former Remain campaigners — and precipitating her removal from office once Parliament reconvened.

On the other hand, her political fate appears to be sealed anyway, so she would not be incurring any cost she is not set to pay to pay already.

Brexit campaign leader Nigel Farage has told Breitbart London’s James Delingpole that he is ready to keep fighting for Brexit, and despite the ongoing betrayal of the 2016 vote by the British political establishment he remains upbeat.

Comparing Brexit — the political and constitutional revolution required to untangle the United Kingdom from 40 years of integration with the increasingly centralised and autocratic European Union — to some of the other great political upheavals in British history, Mr Farage said he was ready to fight the next election.

PICS: Farage Tells Brexit Betrayal Protest ‘We Will Get Our Country Back, We Are Going to Win!’ https://t.co/HPiUgNxco7 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 29, 2019

With an even deeper Brexit betrayal looming, which is likely to see the nation kept in the European Union for months or years into the future, it is becoming more and more likely that Britain will be forced to contest the European Parliament elections in May.

Despite the disappointment of the March 29th Brexit day being cancelled by the Government even though the date was guaranteed by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons 108 times, Mr Farage said he was upbeat and ready to keep fighting.

He told Breitbart London’s James Delingpole at the Leave Means Leave pro-Brexit rally in Westminster that, “Nobody in this country has spent more time, given more effort energy and love to this cause, of us becoming an independent United Kingdom. I should be the most depressed person here, and yet I’m not. I’m ready to fight again.

“We’ve been betrayed by much of Parliament, a duplicitous Prime Minister.”

Mr Farage also likened Brexit to some of the great political battles of the 19th century, including the Great Reform Act of 1832, which abolished many rotten boroughs and extended the right to vote to more of the adult population, and the abolition of slavery.

Both were enormously controversial, long and difficult political processes which nevertheless eventually succeeded and fundamentally changed the British political and social landscape.

Former Nevada Assemblywoman Lucy Flores was not just a victim of Joe Biden, but of a complicit media who deliberately looked the other way for decades.

Serial Young Girl-Toucher (nickname stolen from Ace of Spades) Joe Biden denies the incident with Flores, but the whole world knows he has been caught countless times on video and in photographs behaving inappropriately not only with women, but with young girls — very young girls.

But because Biden is a Democrat, and most especially because he was vice president to Barack “The Precious” Obama, not only has he been allowed to continue his serial young girl-touching rampage, the media have actually encouraged this behavior. Here’s the tip of that iceberg:

NBC News: “Photo of famously friendly Biden goes viral”

Politico: “Joe Biden: Sex symbol?”

U.S. News: “Here’s Joe Biden Being Joe Biden With Ash Carter’s Wife”

CNN: Biden’s ‘Shoulder Squeeze’ Lights Up Internet

BuzzFeed: “Joe Biden Got A Little Handsy With The New Defense Secretary’s Wife – We’ve reached peak Biden.”

In fact, the cover-up of Biden’s behavior was so important to the media that New York Times reporter Nicole Perlroth called on Twitter to censor images of Biden’s numerous #MeToo moments.

“In the past 24 hours, a new alt-right fake news meme had emerged of Biden as predator. How will @twitter handle?” she screeched. And as proof of this alt-right conspiracy, Perlroth linked Richard Armande Mills, who was using images and video of Biden culled from a notoriously racist outlet known as C-SPAN.

The dirty little secret is that for decades the media’s reaction to Biden’s #MeToo-ery was this…

Har, har, har! How quaint! How cute! Joe being Joe and we love Uncle Joe because Democrat.

If you can keep your head from exploding, try to imagine the media’s reaction if Vice President Mike Pence did … this.

But the media were so desperate to protect the Obama administration, outlets like CNN and BuzzFeed didn’t just ignore all of this inappropriate behavior; they encouraged it, excused it, laughed it off, pretended it was charming, all part of awesome Joe’s swingin’ mythology.

And this is why Lucy Flores wasn’t protected — because in 2014, when, Flores alleged, Biden touched her inappropriately, she lived in a world created by the corporate media where it was not only okay for Biden to touch women; it actually boosted his cool factor.

Lucy Flores wasn’t protected because not one person in the media, not even one female person, had the moral courage to break from the herd, to say, “This isn’t right.”

Lucy Flores in her own words:

I was taking deep breaths and preparing myself to make my case to the crowd, I felt two hands on my shoulders. I froze. “Why is the vice-president of the United States touching me?” I felt him get closer to me from behind. He leaned further in and inhaled my hair. I was mortified. I thought to myself, “I didn’t wash my hair today and the vice-president of the United States is smelling it. And also, what in the actual fuck? Why is the vice-president of the United States smelling my hair?” He proceeded to plant a big slow kiss on the back of my head. My brain couldn’t process what was happening. I was embarrassed. I was shocked. I was confused. There is a Spanish saying, “tragame tierra,” it means, “earth, swallow me whole.” I couldn’t move and I couldn’t say anything. I wanted nothing more than to get Biden away from me. My name was called and I was never happier to get on stage in front of an audience.

Again, Biden denies this happened.

No one is comparing Joe Biden to Harvey Weinstein, but as you will see in the links and video below, Biden has a real problem. And if what she claims happened did indeed happen, I don’t blame Flores at all for being mortified. That’s not an overreaction on her part. If someone did that to my wife, he’d wake up on his ass.

And yes, it is an abuse of power on Biden’s part. If he were a stagehand or a lighting guy or a reporter at the Flores event, he never would have done such a thing, but because he was a vice president protected by the complicit media…

And here’s the saddest truth of all…

It would have been breathtakingly easy for the media to get Biden to stop this behavior — behavior you know they all talked about and tsk’d-tsk’d behind the scenes. One little news cycle would have saved heaven knows how many women from Uncle Joe’s Creepy Young Girl-Touching, but partisanship reigned, the media did nothing, and by doing nothing, became complicit in all of Biden’s #MeToo moments.

And, my God, look at them all.

Look at this…

Oh, sure, the media will go after Biden now, but only because it suits their far-left agenda, only because there is now political upside for their rancid identity politics crusade, and Biden’s an old, white guy.

On Saturday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s “Fox & Friends,” Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani stated if the entire Mueller report can be released legally, “put out all of it.”

Giuliani said, “As far as I’m concerned, if they can put it out legally, put out all of it.”

Giuliani further criticized the April 2 deadline set by Democrats in Congress to release the report, stating, “You cannot disclose grand jury material. It is a crime. Now, they can say April 2, but Bill Barr and Rod Rosenstein are not going to jail because they have an unrealistic deadline. So, they may have to go to court and get a court order.”

During Friday’s Democratic Weekly Address, Senator Tina Smith (D-MN) called on Congress to “bring all the ideas to the table and take action on climate. Taking decisive action is good for our health, good for our environment, and good for our economy.”

Transcript as Follows:

“Hi, I am Tina Smith, Senator from Minnesota.

Today, I want to talk with you about climate change.

But before that, I’d like to briefly address the recent news about the Special Counsel’s investigation. In this great country, the government is ultimately accountable to the public, so it is essential that the American people have the opportunity to read the entire Mueller report, and evaluate the investigation’s findings for themselves.

Our democratic principles demand transparency and accountability. Attorney General Barr must release the Mueller report in full.

Now, climate change is an urgent problem. And we Democrats are united in agreement that:

1) climate change is real;

2) it’s caused by human activity; and

3) Congress should take immediate and bold action to address this challenge.

These points should not be controversial. And the conclusion that climate change is an urgent problem is supported by an overwhelming weight of scientific evidence. Unfortunately, too many Republicans in Washington right now—and particularly our current President—refuse to accept these facts.

We can’t respond to this crisis until both parties acknowledge that we have a crisis.

Recently, Democrats asked for a bipartisan Special Committee on the Climate Crisis. When Republicans refused, we forged ahead by appointing ten Democratic members to Senate Democrats’ Special Committee on Climate Change. I’m very happy to be one of the Senators.

Our new committee will work together with colleagues in the House of Representatives. We will highlight how the climate crisis is harming the economic and national security interests of the United States, and we’ll set the stage for bold action on climate.

There was a time when Republican Senators were also leaders in calling for climate action.

In the early 2000s, Senator John McCain of Arizona pushed a strong bipartisan plan to bring greenhouse gas emissions under control in our country. As recently as 2011, there were other ambitious, bipartisan plans in the Senate to tackle climate change.

And then the Republican Party gave up on taking action. But the problem hasn’t gone away. Instead, it grows much worse.

The good news is that young people are leading the way on this issue, and we need to listen to them.

In the Senate, there are small signs of bipartisan progress. For example, there have been multiple bills to encourage carbon capture and storage technologies. One was signed into law just last year.

This helps, but we need bigger and bolder actions as well. I’m working on legislation to establish a national clean electricity standard, an approach that had bipartisan support in the Senate as recently as 2011.

In addition my Democratic colleagues are working on a range of actions, including renewable standards, cap and dividend proposals, and a carbon tax. Senators Tom Udall, Chris Van Hollen, Brian Schatz, and Sheldon Whitehouse lead those efforts. In addition, we should acknowledge that Senators Ed Markey and Jeff Merkley have long led bills to bring about comprehensive climate action. We need to get all the good ideas we can out on the table. And we need the Republicans to come with ideas of their own.

Just this week, Republican Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee proposed a ‘Manhattan Project for Clean Energy’, reviving an idea he pushed a decade ago, which would increase funding for energy research. This is promising.

So let’s bring all the ideas to the table and take action on climate. Taking decisive action is good for our health, good for our environment, and good for our economy. America can either follow or lead on climate change. Democrats think we should lead.”


Hollywood threatened Georgia with a boycott if the state passed a bill that limited abortions to the first six weeks. Peach State lawmakers passed the bill and left-wing celebrities are erupting.

As Breitbart News reported Friday, Hollywood has lined up to warn the state that they would take their business out of Georgia if the “Heartbeat bill,” H.B. 481, passed, a bill that would ban abortion after a heartbeat could be detected in a fetus.

In a letter written by actress-turned-activist Alyssa Milano, stars threaten to “do everything in our power to move our industry to a safer state for women if H.B. 481 becomes law.”

Ben Stiller, Amy Schumer, Rosie O’Donnell, Debra Messing, Alec Baldwin, Sarah Silverman all signed the letter.

After the Georgia House voted to pass H.B. 481 Friday, Milano simply said, “Fuck. This.”

“I guess we won’t be shooting movies and TV in Georgia anymore if this moves forward,” director Judd Apatow declared.

“If Georgia is going to stop pretending it cares about women’s rights by banning abortion, we should stop pretending we want to go there for work,” Chelsea Handler agreed.

Debra Messing also joined in on the boycott train.

Actor Don Cheadle, meanwhile, got into a social media spat with a troll.

Sons of Anarchy star Ron Perlman responded to Apatow’s post, saying, “When the current governor bottom dealt his way into ofice (sic), thus dick-whipping democracy itself, that was enough for me. But I guess everyone has their own boiling point.”

“I stand with staceyabrams naral and so many of my friends in opposition to HB481, a bill being considered right now in Georgia that would essentially ban abortion in the state,” Star Trek star George Takei said. “Georgia residents, please speak out, let your local representatives know.”

The bill still has to be signed by Gov. Brian Kemp (R-GA) to go into effect.


Kabul (AFP) – Taliban fighters on Saturday attacked a convoy carrying Afghanistan’s vice president Abdul Rashid Dostum, in an assault that left the former warlord unscathed but killed one of his bodyguards, an official told AFP.

Enayatullah Babur, Dostum’s former chief of staff, said the hour-long attack also left several others in the convoy wounded.

The attack occurred in the northern province of Balkh, where Dostum had held a rally earlier in the day.

On Twitter, a Taliban spokesman said the insurgent group had carried out the attack and claimed four of Dostum’s bodyguards had been killed.

Dostum, a powerful ethnic Uzbek leader, is notorious in Afghanistan for extreme barbarities and for repeatedly switching loyalties over 40 years of conflict.

Despite a catalogue of war crimes attached to his name and accusations of organising the rape and torture of a political rival, Dostum became Afghanistan’s first vice president in 2014.

At the rally in Balkh, Dostum had claimed he could clear northern Afghanistan of the Taliban within six months — if only the government would let him.

In delayed elections now slated for September, President Ashraf Ghani has chosen to run with Amrullah Saleh, an ethnic Tajik, instead of Dostum.

Dostum has survived several other attempts on his life, including one claimed by the Islamic State group last July in Kabul that killed 23 people including AFP driver Mohammad Akhtar.


Brasília (AFP) – Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro arrives in Israel Sunday, where he will walk a diplomatic tightrope as he seeks to shore up ties with his right-wing counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu while keeping key Arab trade partners onside.

Bolsonaro’s controversial pledge to move Brazil’s embassy to Jerusalem is expected to be high on the agenda during the three-day visit as Netanyahu uses the occasion to boost his standing ahead of April 9 elections.

The Brazilian ex-army captain’s trip comes after his recent visits to the United States and Chile, as part of efforts to build ties with conservative governments around the world.

Neither Brazil nor Israel has released details of the visit, but Bolsonaro is expected to focus on correcting their lopsided trade relationship by boosting Brazilian exports, mainly soybeans and meat.

He is also expected to seek greater access to Israeli defense technology.

In 2018, Brazil’s exports to Israel were worth $321 million dollars, while imports, including fertilizers and chemical products, stood at $1.17 billion, official data shows.

But the issue of relocating Brazil’s embassy will likely dominate the visit, testing the tough-talking Bolsonaro’s diplomatic skills.

Months after promising the shift, which sparked an angry response from Palestinian leaders, Bolsonaro has yet to announce a timetable.

Speaking to reporters Thursday, Bolsonaro suggested he was in no hurry to make a decision.

“Trump took nine months to decide, to give his final word, so that the embassy was transferred,” Bolsonaro said.

“Perhaps now we will open a commercial office in Jerusalem.”

– Risky move –

While moving the embassy would please Bolsonaro’s evangelical Christian support base, it would run the risk of provoking commercial retaliation from Arab states, some of which are major importers of Brazilian meat.

The issue has “a very important symbolic weight,” said Paulo Kramer, a professor at the University of Brasilia.

“If he doesn’t announce it on the trip, it will frustrate his voters’ expectations and upset evangelical groups,” federal lawmaker Marcos Pereira, who is also president of a parliamentary Brazil-Israel friendship group, told AFP.

The decision to move the embassy is highly sensitive because Israel claims all of Jerusalem as its capital, while Palestinians view east Jerusalem as the capital of their future state.

Virtually all countries agree that Jerusalem’s status can only be defined through wider Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations.

So far, only the United States and Guatemala have broken with that consensus by opening embassies in Jerusalem. Paraguay backtracked on a decision last year to move its embassy. Israel and the US have spoken with Honduras about its embassy going to Jerusalem.

“Moving the embassy of any country… is a violation of international law and an attack on the Palestinian people,” the Palestinian envoy to Brazil, Ibrahim Alzeben, told AFP this week.

For Netanyahu, who faces a strong challenge from former military chief Benny Gantz in next month’s election, Bolsonaro’s visit will help him demonstrate that “he has friends around the world,” Raphael Eldad, Israeli ambassador to Brazil from 2011 to 2014, told AFP.

“In the international context, Israel cannot ignore friends.”


On Friday’s broadcast of HBO’s “Real Time,” host Bill Maher stated that Attorney General William Barr is a “stooge” who is engaging in behavior similar to “a high-tech coup.”

Maher said, “[Y]ou know, high-tech lynching. Remember that phrase? This is like a high-tech coup. I know Barr is an esteemed person, William Barr. He’s a stooge. This is what Third World countries do. The dictator appoints somebody who exonerates him. That’s what happened here.”

He later added, “I think the whole point of what Barr did was to give Trump a month-long lead to get out there and do the end zone dance, put the bullshit out, I’m completely exonerated. Because then, when we come up with the other stuff, it’s a month later, and then we’re like undoing something.”

On Friday’s broadcast of HBO’s “Real Time,” host Bill Maher stated that if the Trump campaign’s actions don’t amount to collusion, “Then the law is wrong.”

Former U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said, “The thing that Bob Mueller found, is that, based on the criminal statutes, he could not prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, presumably, that there was a conspiracy before the fact, an agreement, a meeting of the minds, about doing those bad things.”

Bharara added that the Trump camp did things that were wrong, but that a prosecutor’s job is “narrow.”

Maher responded, “Then the law is wrong. If all that doesn’t add up to collusion, then the law is f*cked up.”

Friday on MSNBC’s “All In,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) commented on the Republican blowback to her so-called Green New Deal proposal.

After playing several video clips of Republicans linking her proposal to socialism and criticizing the cost, host Chris Hayes asked if she expected the “24-hour AOC and GND” obsession on conservative media.

Ocasio-Cortez said, “Well, I mean, it is next level. I didn’t expect them to make total fools of themselves.”

She added, “Frankly, I expected a little more nuance and a little more concerned trolling.”

Democrats, facing conservative resistance to New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s “Green New Deal,” are now pivoting toward other environmental legislation.

Ocasio-Cortez had an ambitious goal: 100% renewable energy by 2030, and a wave of “green” jobs to replace the ones lost in the abandonment of more traditional sources of power. But after heated debate with the other side of the aisle, many liberal politicians are pulling back from the freshman congresswoman’s radical vision.

On Tuesday, the Senate voted against crucial Green New Deal legislation. According to The Hill, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell “set up the vote to test the Democratic Party’s unity over climate change.” Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey introduced the Green New Deal to the Senate in February, and sees this failure as a call for action from Congress.

“We’re now in the process where the hearings have started on the House side,” Markey said. “Committee after committee have had the first hearings that haven’t been held for eight years. And ideas and legislation will start emanating from committee after committee looking specifically at what has to happen.”

But even Ocasio-Cortez and the advocacy groups who lent their weight to the Green New Deal have started to back down. Josh Nelson, co-director of progressive group Credo Action, has adjusted expectations:

Right now, our ask for members of the House and Senate is to co-sponsor the Green New Deal. With a climate change denier in the White House, we don’t anticipate this or any other legislation we support being signed into law in the next 21 months.

The Sunrise Movement — a youth-oriented advocacy initiative best known for their sit-in at Nancy Pelosi’s office demanding action on climate change — is also taking a big step away. Co-founder Varshini Prakash told reporters on Tuesday that the Green New Deal was “never created with the intention of passing.”

“Ocasio-Cortez’s office is working on legislation in coming weeks and months,” Sunrise Communications Director Stephen O’Hanlon told The Hill. “It won’t just be a resolution, it would be a bill that we’d want to pass through Congress that have the principles of the Green New Deal.”

The only one left giving full-throated support to the seemingly doomed environmental legislation is President Donald Trump, of all people. “I want them to keep going forward with it because I want to campaign against it,” he said, calling it “easy to beat.”

Job Creators Network President Alfredo Ortiz called out Democrats to Breitbart News radio listeners Friday morning for trying to push the multi-trillion Green New Deal through piecemeal.

Host Alex Marlow played a clip of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ranting about the Green New Deal this week. “People are dying, they are dying,” she said in the course of the diatribe against dissenters.

Cortez’s speech used South Bronx children suffering from asthma and children in Flint, Michigan, along with claims that their illnesses resulted from climate change. She called climate change a “national crisis,” comparing it to the Great Depression and WWII.

“The cost of pursuing the Green New Deal will be far less than the cost of not passing it,” Cortez claimed.

Ortiz called Cortez passionate. He said his heart goes out to the kids in Flint, the kids in south Bronx, but it doesn’t have to do with climate change, it has to do with government.

Ortiz reminded listeners that one cost estimate for the Green New Deal was $93 trillion. “It’s no wonder that not a single Senator, not a single Democrat Senator, not even the sponsor himself, voted for the Green- they just voted present.”

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has revealed that Democrats will break up portions of the Green New Deal to consider individually.

“They’re famous for doing this,” Ortiz said. “This is what the Democrats do. They love incrementalizing their way to what they want…we need to call that out.”

“Somebody needs to call b.s. on these people,” said Ortiz, who then pointed to Cortez’s critical influence in killing a deal to bring a second Amazon headquarters to New York. Amazon estimated it would hire 40,000 and Ortiz added that this could have brought in a ripple effect totaling 120,000 new jobs for a “blighted area.”

JCN has run several billboards in New York aimed at Rep. Cortez and the part she played in keeping Amazon and resulting jobs and revenue out of New York.

During a town hall on MSNBC on Friday, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) stated that the Green New Deal isn’t just about climate, but is also about the economy and social and racial justice. She added that the U.S. has “confronted this type of stagnation and this type of systemic threat” before during the Great Depression, World War II, and the Cold War by mobilizing the economy.

Host Chris Hayes asked, “[T]he first big issue you’re doing is the Green New Deal. So, why this issue, front and center, first thing? What connects you to this?”

Ocasio-Cortez began by answering, “So, this issue is not just about our climate. First and foremost, we need to save ourselves, period.”

She continued, “But, how I access this issue is that I started looking at all of our problems. We have runaway income inequality. We are at one of our most unequal points, economically speaking, in American history. We are dealing with a crisis of how our economy is even made up. Our economy is increasingly financialized, which means we are making profits off of interest, off of leasing your phone, off of doing all of these things, but we aren’t producing and we aren’t innovating in the way that we need to as an economy. And I also was looking at our issues of social justice, social and racial justice, of which we are — which have a nexus here in the Bronx, and what I started thinking about, to myself, was, listen, we’re looking at all of these issues, Medicare for all, a living wage, tuition-free public colleges and universities, and there’s this false idea that we need to put them all in a line and say, do this or do that. … And then I started to realize that these are not different problems. These are all part of the same problem.”

Ocasio-Cortez added, “In the past, we’ve confronted this type of stagnation and this type of systemic threat as a country. First of all, we’ve been here before. We’ve been here before with the Great Depression. We’ve been here before with World War II, even the Cold War. And the answer has been an ambitious and directed mobilization of the American economy to direct — and solve our problem, our biggest problem. And historically speaking, we have mobilized our entire economy around war, but I thought to myself, it doesn’t have to be that way, especially when our greatest existential threat is climate change.”

Sydney (AFP) – The Sydney Opera House and the Harbour Bridge were plunged into darkness for an hour Saturday to raise awareness about climate change and its impact on the planet’s vanishing biodiversity.

The 13th edition of Earth Hour, organised by the green group WWF, will see millions of people across 180 countries turn off their lights at 8:30 pm local time to highlight energy use and the need for conservation.

“We are the first generation to know we are destroying the world. And we could be the last that can do anything about it,” the charity said.

“We have the solutions, we just need our voices to be heard.”

WWF-Australia CEO Dermot O’Gorman told AFP that “Earth hour still is the world’s largest grassroots movement for people to take action on climate change”.

“It’s about individuals taking personal action but joining with hundreds of millions of people around the world to show that not only do we need urgent action on climate change but we need to be protecting our planet,” he added.

Dozens of companies around the world have said they will join in this year’s switch-off.

The event comes after some of the most dire warnings yet on the state of Earth’s natural habitat and species.

WWF’s own “Living Planet” report in October said that 60 percent of all animals with a backbone — fish, birds, amphibians, reptiles and mammals — had been wiped out by human activity since 1970.

Another dataset confirmed the depth of an unfolding mass extinction event, only the sixth in the last half-billion years.

Paris’s Eiffel Tower, New York’s Empire State Building, Dubai’s Burj Khalifa and the Acropolis in Athens are among the 24 global landmarks that will take part in Earth Hour.

Last year’s event was observed in more than 7,000 towns and cities in 187 countries, according to organisers.

While the lights-off event is a symbolic gesture, Earth Hour has led successful campaigns over the past decade to ban plastics in the Galapagos Islands and plant 17 million trees in Kazakhstan.

The Hague (AFP) – Teaching cows to use the toilet is not the easiest task, but a Dutch inventor is banking on a new bovine urinal to help cut emissions that cause environmental damage.

Tests have started on a farm in the Netherlands on the device which collects some of the 15 to 20 litres of urine that the average cow produces a day.

That produces huge amounts of ammonia in a country like the Netherlands, which is the world’s second biggest agricultural exporter after the United States.

“We are tackling the problem at the source,” Henk Hanskamp, the Dutch inventor and businessman behind the “Cow Toilet”, told AFP Friday.

“A cow is never going to be completely clean but you can teach them to go to the toilet.”

The way the toilet works is “udderly” ingenious.

The urinal is in a box placed behind the cow, while in front is a feeding trough. Once the animal finishes eating a robot arm stimulates a nerve near the udders, which then makes it want to urinate.

The cow toilets are currently being tested on a farm near the eastern Dutch town of Doetinchem and seven of its 58 cows have already learned how to use them without the need for stimulation.

“The cows have got used to it,” Hanskamp said. “They recognise the box, lift their tail, and pee.”

“The stables have become cleaner and the ground is drier. Less damp ground is better for the health of the cows’ hooves,” Jan Velema, a vet who took part in the tests, was quoted as saying by De Volkskrant newspaper.

The Netherlands is already introducing stricter rules on emissions of ammonia, which can cause atmospheric pollution and irritate the eyes in humans.

The chemical can also be implicated in the creation of environmentally damaging algae blooms when it mixes with water.

Hanskamp, whose company develops agricultural machinery, says it could “reduce by at least half the amount of ammonia produced” were the cow to urinate on open ground.

The company aims to have them on the market by 2020, he said.

Jon Snow, star anchor for publicly-owned Channel 4 News, has drawn criticism for appearing to racialise a protest in support of Brexit yesterday, claiming he had “never seen so many white people in one place”.

Snow, himself a white, upper-middle-class son of a Church of England bishop, made the controversial observation while closing out his on-the-ground coverage of a long day of protest against the Government, Members of Parliament, and the European Council coming together to delay Brexit, which was originally scheduled for 11 p.m. on March 29th, but has now been pushed to at least April or May, and may yet be postponed beyond 2019 or cancelled altogether.

The British people voted to Leave the European Union in June 2016, despite Remainers heavily outspending Leavers and receiving direct assistance from the Government of the day under David Cameron, almost three years ago.

“There are crowds rallying outside Downing Street. We’ve just got these pictures in which were taken nearby,” the presenter narrated, as Channel 4 cut to footage of protesters outside the gates which seal off the cul-de-sac where the official residences of the Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer are located from the public.

“Police are now wearing riot gear. Police dogs are patrolling. The mood has changed.

“We cannot confirm whether any arrests have been made.

“It has been the most extraordinary day. A day which has seen — I’ve never seen so many white people in one place!” he exclaimed, seemingly horrified.

“It’s an extraordinary story — there are people everywhere, there are crowds everywhere.”

I have never seen so many PATRIOTS in one place. No one tell Jon Snow… pic.twitter.com/6DcrqfPptw — Amandeep SinghBhogal (@AmandeepBhogal) March 30, 2019

Snow’s comments were criticised by many members of the public, including Conservative Party activist and first-generation immigrant Amandeep Singh Bhogal, who posted pictures from a Brexit rally in Parliament Square captioned, “I have never seen so many PATRIOTS in one place.”

“Regardless of whether you voted Leave or Remain can we all agree @jonsnowC4 was wrong to bring people’s skin colour into the Brexit debate,” another observer added.

“It’s utterly irrelevant. People of all racial backgrounds voted for Brexit and Remain.”

I remember Jon Snow visiting a village fete here in Wiltshire, and expressing how surprised and appalled he was how few black faces there were. It revealed a lack of awareness of the ethnic composition of districts outside London. Wiltshire is 96.7% white whereas London is 59.8%. — Guy Walters (@guywalters) March 30, 2019

Others questioned how likely it really was that Snow had “never seen so many white people in one place” before, considering he was born in 1947 when Britain’s visible ethnic minority population numbered only a few thousands.

He also spent much of his youth in boarding schools, one run by his bishop father, which were dominated by England’s predominantly white elite class.

The broadcaster, married to a Zimbabwe-born health professional more than 25 years his junior, has been in trouble for appearing to be partisan before, reportedly joining in chants of “Fuck the Tories” at the open-air annual music festival in Glastonbury, Somerset, in 2017, where hard-left Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn gave a speech.

Channel 4 claimed they had reprimanded their anchor, telling the Huffington Post that he was “spoken to and reminded of his responsibilities around due impartiality”.

Jon Snow, star anchor for publicly-owned Channel 4 News, has drawn criticism for appearing to racialise a protest in support of Brexit yesterday, claiming he had “never seen so many white people in one place”.

Snow, himself a white, upper-middle-class son of a Church of England bishop, made the controversial observation while closing out his on-the-ground coverage of a long day of protest against the Government, Members of Parliament, and the European Council coming together to delay Brexit, which was originally scheduled for 11 p.m. on March 29th, but has now been pushed to at least April or May, and may yet be postponed beyond 2019 or cancelled altogether.

The British people voted to Leave the European Union in June 2016, despite Remainers heavily outspending Leavers and receiving direct assistance from the Government of the day under David Cameron, almost three years ago.

“There are crowds rallying outside Downing Street. We’ve just got these pictures in which were taken nearby,” the presenter narrated, as Channel 4 cut to footage of protesters outside the gates which seal off the cul-de-sac where the official residences of the Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer are located from the public.

“Police are now wearing riot gear. Police dogs are patrolling. The mood has changed.

“We cannot confirm whether any arrests have been made.

“It has been the most extraordinary day. A day which has seen — I’ve never seen so many white people in one place!” he exclaimed, seemingly horrified.

“It’s an extraordinary story — there are people everywhere, there are crowds everywhere.”

Snow’s comments were criticised by many members of the public, including Conservative Party activist and first-generation immigrant Amandeep Singh Bhogal, who posted pictures from a Brexit rally in Parliament Square captioned, “I have never seen so many PATRIOTS in one place.”

“Regardless of whether you voted Leave or Remain can we all agree @jonsnowC4 was wrong to bring people’s skin colour into the Brexit debate,” another observer added.

“It’s utterly irrelevant. People of all racial backgrounds voted for Brexit and Remain.”

I remember Jon Snow visiting a village fete here in Wiltshire, and expressing how surprised and appalled he was how few black faces there were. It revealed a lack of awareness of the ethnic composition of districts outside London. Wiltshire is 96.7% white whereas London is 59.8%. — Guy Walters (@guywalters) March 30, 2019

Others questioned how likely it really was that Snow had “never seen so many white people in one place” before, considering he was born in 1947 when Britain’s visible ethnic minority population numbered only a few thousands.

He also spent much of his youth in boarding schools, one run by his bishop father, which were dominated by England’s predominantly white elite class.

I imagine @jonsnowC4 probably saw quite a lot of white people at the boarding school he attended and at his dad’s church too #WhiteSaturday pic.twitter.com/aGEnAOTpQW — Mike Graham 🍾 (@Iromg) March 30, 2019

The broadcaster, married to a Zimbabwe-born health professional more than 25 years his junior, has been in trouble for appearing to be partisan before, reportedly joining in chants of “Fuck the Tories” at the open-air annual music festival in Glastonbury, Somerset, in 2017, where hard-left Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn gave a speech.

Channel 4 claimed they had reprimanded their anchor, telling the Huffington Post that he was “spoken to and reminded of his responsibilities around due impartiality”.

PARIS (AP) – French yellow vest protesters are rallying to support an activist injured in a confrontation with police.

The demonstrators are undeterred by protest bans or repeated injuries in 20 weeks of demonstrations. So they’re marching again Saturday in Paris, Bordeaux and other cities to keep pressing President Emmanuel Macron to do more to help the working classes, redesign French politics – or step down altogether.

They’re also showing solidarity with Genevieve Legay, a 73-year-old anti-globalization activist who suffered a head injury in the southern city of Nice last weekend. The Nice prosecutor said a police officer pushed her down.

“We are all Genevieve!” read an online appeal for Saturday’s protests.

The main Paris protest will start to weave through the Left Bank and past the Eiffel Tower. Protests are banned around the Champs-Elysees, scene of recent rioting.

Italy’s populist Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini has called for the “chemical castration” of three men who allegedly filmed themselves raping a 19-year-old American tourist in Catania.

The three Italian men, Roberto Mirabella, 20, Salvatore Castrogiovanni, 19, and Agatino Spampinato, also 19, were arrested on March 21st for the gang rape attack, said to have occurred on March 15th, Il Giornale reports.

According to investigators, the three men met up with the American teen at a bar and offered her a drink. They allegedly suggested moving to another bar and once outside forced her into a car.

After driving to a secluded area, the three men are accused of preventing the teen from calling the police and taking turns sexually assaulting her and filming the ordeal on their mobile phones.

Salvini, who also serves as Minister of the Interior, was direct in his condemnation of the attack and the alleged attacker,s saying, “For the raping worms of Catania, who have raped a tourist, no discount: a certainty of punishment and chemical castration!”

Earlier this week, Minister for Public Administration Giulia Bongiorno submitted an amendment to a bill to make the use of chemical castration for rapists an option for the courts.

“We have submitted an amendment to the Chamber to insert the possibility of subordinating the suspension of the sentence to a therapeutic or pharmacological inhibitory treatment of the libido,” she said.

“The League party has been supporting this measure for some time; indeed it is one of the reasons, along with ‘legitimate defence’, that has brought me closer to them,” she added, referring to the populist party’s push for stronger self-defence laws.

Salvini recently passed a law on the legitimate use of force against home invaders, who will now be allowed to use force against those attempting to break into their homes.

The populist party leader has previously gone on record stating he would like to see Italy’s gun laws liberalised and previously even offered to pay the legal costs of people prosecuted for defending their homes.

The Danish government has agreed this week to refuse to allow children born to Danish Islamic State fighters overseas to claim citizenship and a passport.

The policy comes after the government brokered a deal with the populist Danish People’s Party (DF), ending the previous policy which allowed the children of Islamic State fighters from Denmark the ability to claim citizenship, broadcaster DR reports.

The measure was backed by foreign minister Inger Støjberg, who is well-known for her tough stance against mass migration, who said, “They are born of parents who have turned their backs on Denmark and therefore they should not belong to Denmark.”

Støjberg has become well-known for her tough migration policies which have included rejecting European Union migrant quotas after arguing that not enough migrants contribute to Danish society, and arguing that migrants should “adjust to Danish values.”

Danish-Born Islamic State Fighter Stripped of Citizenship https://t.co/HJOXYgR7N0 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 15, 2017

Christian Langballe, a spokesman for the DF, welcomed the proposal, saying the party had pushed for such a measure for an extended period of time.

“They are born down there, they have never known Denmark, they have no connection with Denmark, and we must remember that it is the parents who have chosen to go down in the war zone to fight for the Islamic State,” Langballe said.

It will also now be possible for the Danish government to strip the citizenship of Islamic State members who are dual nationals without going through the court system.

“We don’t want them back home.,” Langballe said and added, “We have seen returning Syrian warriors, for example, returning to France. Here they committed this terrible terrorist attack on, among other things, the Bataclan venue and murdered 129 people.”

The danger of returning fighters has also become an issue in neighbouring Sweden where it has been alleged that some have begun attempting to recruit young people in underground mosques in the city of Malmö.

Støjberg agreed, saying that if the fighters have another citizenship then she saw no reason for them to ever return to Denmark. “They are undesirable in Denmark,” she said.

BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) – Voters in Slovakia are selecting a new head of state in a runoff that could give the country its first female president.

Zuzana Caputova, an environmental activist, is up against European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic in the vote for the largely ceremonial post in the nation of 5.4 million.

Caputova won the first round two week ago with 40.6 percent of the vote while Sefcovic was a distant second with 18.7 percent.

Caputova attracts voters appalled by corruption and mainstream politics. Sefcovic is a career diplomat who is supported by the leftist Smer-Social Democracy party, a major force in Slovak politics.

The winner will become the country’s fifth head of state since Slovakia gained independence in 1993 after Czechoslovakia split in two.

Incumbent Andrej Kiska did not stand for a second term.

On Friday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “MTP Daily,” House Judiciary Committee member Jamie Raskin (D-MD) commented on Attorney General William Barr’s letter about the release of the Mueller report by saying, “it’s somewhat inscrutable, but disturbing what the attorney general has written here.”

Raskin said, “In this one, he says that the president has the opportunity to exercise executive privilege over some parts of it, but the president has deferred to him instead. So, he’s not going to pre-clear the report with the president. But does that mean that Attorney General Barr is going to be excising parts of the report, asserting the executive privilege for the president? Again, it’s somewhat inscrutable, but disturbing what the attorney general has written here.”

Attorney General William Barr told congressional leaders he plans to release a redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller’s nearly 400-page report on alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in the 2016 presidential election by mid-April.

“Everyone will soon be able to read it on their own,” Barr wrote in a letter to Republican and Democrat leaders in the House and Senate on Friday.

The Justice Department head also stated he is prepared to testify before both the Senate and House Judiciary committees regarding Mueller’s findings on May 1st-2nd. Barr told lawmakers while President Trump could assert executive privilege on certain materials, the president intends to “defer to me” on such matters. He also said the Justice Department has no plans to provide the Mueller report to the White House.

The development comes after the Justice Department announced Sunday that Mueller’s investigation did not find evidence that the Trump campaign “conspired or coordinated” with Russia in the last election. Barr said that Mueller did not “exonerate” the president of obstructing justice, noting that his summary “sets out evidence on both sides of the question.”

Meanwhile, top House Democrats have made repeated calls for the entire report to be made public. Appearing Wednesday on SiriusXM Progress channel’s Make It Plain, House Speaker Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said it was “a little bit arrogant” of Barr to believe Democrats would accept only seeing his four-page summary of Mueller‘s report.

“We just haven’t even seen the Mueller report, and we don’t expect to accept just the attorney general’s interpretation of it. A little bit arrogant of him to think that that would be the case,” Pelosi said. “We have to get the report. They, to their peril, will keep that report.”

Despite Mueller’s findings, numerous Democrats such as House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) refuse to concede the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin. In an interview with the Washington Post Wednesday, the California Democrat said he believes “Undoubtedly there is collusion.”

“We will continue to investigate the counterintelligence issues. That is, is the president or people around him compromised in any way by a hostile foreign power? … It doesn’t appear that was any part of Mueller’s report,” he told the Post.

House Intelligence Committee Republicans on Thursday called on Schiff to step down as chairman from the powerful panel, citing his consistent promotion of the “demonstrably false” Trump-Russia collision narrative.

Thursday on the Senate floor, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said Attorney General William Barr delaying the release of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report had “the odor of political expediency” to help President Donald Trump.

Partial transcript as follows:

SCHUMER: Yesterday, for the second time this week, Leader McConnell blocked our request made by the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Dianne Feinstein, to make public the full report authored by special counsel Mueller. I want to thank Senator Feinstein for making the request and for standing up for transparency. As Senator Feinstein said, a four-page summary from a political appointee is hardly a sufficient substitute for special counsel Mueller’s two-year investigation.

There are reports this morning that the Mueller report is over 300 pages. All we have gotten is four-page summary by someone appointed by the administration, who before he took office felt the president could never, almost never, be called for obstruction of justice, one of the main parts of the Mueller investigation. For Mr. Barr to quickly issue a four-page report in his attempt to try and exonerate President Trump and now to delay the release of an over 300-page report written by Mueller, so the American people and we senators and congressmen can see what was written, has too much of the odor of political expediency to help the man who appointed him, President Trump.

The American people have a right to know the full scope of the facts behind Russia’s interference in our election. The American people have a right to make their own conclusions about actions taken by this administration. The American people deserve to have full confidence in the integrity of our system and the impartiality of the rule of law, and only the full release of the report can affirm that. What I’m saying here shouldn’t be controversial. In the House, it passed 420-0 to make the resolution—the resolution to make the full report public. Voted for by such partisan defenders of the president like Representative Jordan and Representative Meadows. And transparency, we all know, is all the more important because the attorney general has made no secret of his antipathy toward this investigation and appears intent on holding the report secret for as long as possible. I guess his hope is let the dust settle and then no one will pay attention. Well, he’s wrong about that. He’s prolonging this thing. Remember, this attorney general made clear that he was hostile to the special counsel and opposed to Mueller’s inquiry into obstruction of justice, and then he opines about it two days later without showing anybody any backing? That is so wrong.

According to press reports on his phone call yesterday with Mr. Nadler, Mr. Barr would not even commit to releasing the whole report at any time. He wouldn’t commit to a date. He wasn’t even willing to disclose how many pages are in the counsel’s report, as if that were some kind of state secret. Since that conversation, there are reports it is over 300 pages. If it is, it’s just disgraceful for Mr. Barr, who was able to read through it and summarize it in 48 hours to say now he can’t release it because he is busy culling it. The administration, the attorney general must end the stalling and the secrecy. It’s not going to be a happy opening chapter for the attorney general when history looks back upon what he has done. We should make the report public now.

Friday on MSNBC’s “Deadline,” network host Al Sharpton said an impeachment process against former president Richard Nixon was in part for obstruction of justice, so President Donald Trump could still be in trouble.

Sharpton said, “You have to ask the question, why did everybody lie if there was nothing to lie about? Whether he was a useful idiot or whether he was greedy trying to get a deal in Moscow for the Trump organization — because remember he never thought he would win for president—and whether they were maneuvering him, I think Putin—Trump and I both come from New York.”

“There’s a game in Times Square, they beat you out of your money, Three-Card Monty, Putin could have been been playing him, you know he wants a hotel, I’ll do this, do that, and then they had to obstruct justice because they got out too far,” he continued. “They woke up not on Fifth Avenue. They were in the White House. That’s why I want to know where obstruction. Obstruction does not mean you colluded. Obstruction means you obstructed. Nixon may never have known about the break-in and who would pay for it, but when he participated in the cover-up, that’s when the Republicans said he had to go. So I don’t care if he was a conspirator in the beginning, an idiot in the middle or someone that obstructed at the end, we need to know.”

Students at Dickinson College are taking issue with signs around campus that encourage students to take the stairs instead of elevators to improve their health. The students reportedly consider the signs “fat shaming,” as they promote the “dangerous narrative” that weight loss as “a positive thing.”

According to a report from the Dickinson College student newspaper, students were offended this month by a series of signs around campus that encourage students to avoid elevators. “Why not take the stairs if you are physically able?” the signs read. “Exercise and strengthen your heart and muscles.”

One student said that the signs made her feel guilty. She said that taking the stairs often caused her to feel dizzy. “I began to feel guilty every time that I took the elevator,” the student said. “I started realizing that I shouldn’t put my body through pain or stress when there is an elevator I could use,” she said.

Another student said that the signs were “fat shaming.” “These signs were effectively fat shaming as they promoted weight loss as a positive thing,” the student said. “It had a negative impact on campus to have a series of signs that glorified a dangerous narrative that feeds into eating disorders.”

Marni Jones, the dean and director of access and disability services at Dickinson College, said that the sign could be offensive to students who are forced to use elevators.

“Even with the qualifier “if you are physically able,” seeing a sign like this can feel shaming to those who have no choice but to use the elevator,” Jones said in a comment to the student newspaper. “I showed a picture of one of the posters to a student with a mobility impairment, who has difficulty using steps after having had four hip surgeries, to see what she thought about it, and she was visibly dejected upon reading it, saying, ‘That’s really unfair. You don’t know what other people are going through.’”

Australian Researchers have produced a study that has led them to believe the word “cyclists” should be banned, because it “dehumanizes” people who ride bikes.

Researchers at Queensland University of Technology and Monash University claim to have found a link between the word “cyclists” and a tendency for motorists to “dehumanize” bikers, according to the Daily Mail.

Queensland University Professor Narelle Haworth claimed the study found 55 percent of non-cyclists surveyed in Victoria, NSW, and Queensland felt that cyclists were “not completely human.”

With those results in hand, Haworth is advocating for an end to the use of the word “cyclists.”

Haworth, who is also Director of the Centre for Accident Research and Road Safety in Queensland, insisted that the elimination of the word would help bike rider safety.

“If we used the term people on bikes, instead of cyclists, we’re giving a term that is more human-like and less like a species,” Haworth told Daily Mail.

“We need to spread the idea that those people [cyclists] could be any of us. There is need to grow a culture of mutual respect for people on bikes,” Hayworth added.

The study also reportedly found that one in ten drivers would purposefully block bike riders and admitted to cutting off bikers in the past. Others admitted to yelling at bikers and even throwing things at them.

The professor insisted that eliminating the word would take some of the sting out of the negativity between bike riders and motorists.

Jakarta (AFP) – A pair of bare-breasted mermaid statues have been given the family values treatment at an Indonesian amusement park where officials slipped golden tube tops over their chests.

While the nude statues have been on display for years at Jakarta’s Ancol Dreamland, a recent policy aimed at respecting “Eastern values” has seen the mermaids get an official cover-up.

The statues were initially just covered with gold fabric, but they’ve now also been moved to a more secluded area after visitors kept pulling the coverings down, park sources told AFP.

Ancol Dreamland spokeswoman Rika Lestari insisted no outside agitators were behind the cover-up.

“There was no pressure from any group,” she said. “Ancol is trying to become an amusement park and vacation spot for families.”

That didn’t stop the park’s move from being widely mocked.

“Thanks Ancol. Now, no one will commit adultery of the eyes from looking at the mermaids’ breasts,” comedian Soleh Solihun wrote on Twitter.

Earlier, Lestari told the Indonesian newspaper Kompas: “We’re Eastern people, we have Eastern culture, so what was inappropriate we made it more appropriate.

“It’s just a matter of perception, because what we’ve done was the best for us. It’s a good thing, so why not.”

Indonesia is the world’s biggest Muslim majority country and relatively conservative social values are prevalent.

Former Nevada Assemblywoman Lucy Flores, now a Social Justice Activist, revealed that Vice President Joe Biden was “creepy” with her during a campaign event.

She said in an essay for The Cut that the incident occurred during her campaign for lieutenant governor in Nevada in 2014, when Biden came to the state to help the campaign.

But before the campaign rally, he touched her in a way that she felt was inappropriate:

I was taking deep breaths and preparing myself to make my case to the crowd, I felt two hands on my shoulders. I froze. “Why is the vice-president of the United States touching me?” I felt him get closer to me from behind. He leaned further in and inhaled my hair. I was mortified. I thought to myself, “I didn’t wash my hair today and the vice-president of the United States is smelling it. And also, what in the actual fuck? Why is the vice-president of the United States smelling my hair?” He proceeded to plant a big slow kiss on the back of my head. My brain couldn’t process what was happening. I was embarrassed. I was shocked. I was confused. There is a Spanish saying, “tragame tierra,” it means, “earth, swallow me whole.” I couldn’t move and I couldn’t say anything. I wanted nothing more than to get Biden away from me. My name was called and I was never happier to get on stage in front of an audience.

Flores said that pictures of Biden touching other women inappropriately made it more difficult to keep silent, referring to Biden nuzzling the neck of Secretary of Defense Secretary Ash Carter’s wife, kissing Sen. Chuck Grassley’s wife on the lips, whispering in women’s ears, and snuggling women on the campaign trail.

“I may have been able to give Biden the benefit of the doubt. Had there not been multiple articles written over the years about the exact same thing — calling his creepy behavior an ‘open secret’ — perhaps it would feel less offensive,” she wrote. “And yet despite the steady stream of pictures and the occasional article, Biden retained his title of America’s Favorite Uncle.”

Biden has earned some negative attention for his past behavior, including mockery from Jon Stewart in a 2015 Daily Show segment.

“Apparently, the Senate rite of passage is you’re not really sworn in until ‘Delaware Joe’ has felt up one member of your immediate family,” Stewart joked.

Flores said that she felt that it was important for her to speak out, as Biden was considering a run for president in 2020.

Following the release of the “no collusion” Mueller report, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has led the charge to focus on saving the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare as the government-run health care program faces an uncertain future.

Democrats have introduced legislation that would reduce health insurance premiums, protect people with pre-existing conditions, and place restrictions on some types of insurance.

The move has gained support from a lot of Democrats, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (R-NY), the New York Times reported.

But Ocasio-Cortez’s former mentor disagrees. When asked by reporters about it, presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) had a one-word response: “No.”

The Times reported:

“No,” he said again, when pressed. “The incremental reform that I support is phasing in ‘Medicare for all.’” Mr. Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont, is not one to compromise on his long-held policy positions, especially his signature stance on health care, though he has, in fact, supported non-“Medicare for all” legislation in the past, including backing a 2017 bill to allow people to buy into state Medicaid plans. Mr. Sanders’s unflinching position is a reminder to voters that he is unabashedly left-wing and unlikely to worry about working within the confines of the existing system anytime soon. It also reflects a schism within the Democratic Party over the best way to recapture power in Washington: Should Democrats project big, bold policy ideas that could fundamentally alter the political structure but face long odds in a hyperpartisan Congress? Or should they present incremental measures that are more likely to appeal to the center and could succeed sooner?

The Times speculated about the other Democrats hoping to occupy the White House, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who wants to do both.

Other candidates, like Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), former Congressman Beto O-Rourke (D-TX) and even former Vice President Joe Biden — if he finally does get in the race — are taking a more bi-partisan approach, according to the Times.

“It is a debate that has raged within the party since before the midterm elections last year, with some strategists suggesting that bold, disruptive ideas like the ones championed by Mr. Sanders electrify voters and spur them to the polls,” the Times reported.

“Whoever is president next just can’t make incremental change,” Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser to the progressive political organizing group MoveOn.org, who worked on President Barack Obama’s 2008 and 2012 campaigns, said in the Times report. “We just have to be bold, and we have to take chances — people are hurting. We need to move forward in a big way.”

Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) said recently that the U.S. health care system is “broken” and also called for “Medicare for all.” But he also expressed support for “practical things,” like lowering drug prices — an issue popular on both sides of the aisle.

“The path to the White House and to majorities has to be in a pragmatic, progressive area,” Jim Kessler, executive vice president for policy at Third Way, a leftist think tank, said in the Times report. “If you go too far left, Donald Trump gets re-elected, and Republicans control both houses of Congress.”

Robert Francis ‘Beto’ O’Rourke will cross Texas with three rallies to officially kick off his 2020 presidential campaign Saturday.

The failed 2018 Senate candidate will start with a 10:00 a.m. rally in El Paso, Texas, O’Rourke’s hometown. The event will be live-streamed to O’Rourke’s Facebook page. The event will take place at the intersection of El Paso St. and Overland Ave.

Texas Southern University will host O’Rourke’s second rally of the day in Houston at 5:00 p.m. local time.

O’Rourke’s third and final stop of the day will be at 9th and Congress in Austin, Texas, from 9:00-11:00 p.m. local time.

The Texas events require attendees to RSVP to get tickets.

O’Rourke has been traveling around the country campaigning since announcing his candidacy on March 14.

The Texas Democrat politician raked in massive record fundraising totals during his 2018 Senate run and came within striking distance of his opponent, incumbent Republican Senator Ted Cruz.

Democrats have long sought to capture a presidential election win in the red state. O’Rourke has trailed Democrat frontrunners in the growing list of 2020 presidential candidates. CNN posted results of a Quinnipiac poll released Thursday showing O’Rourke at 12 percent behind former Vice President Joe Biden’s 29 percent and Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 19 percent.

The freshman class in the House have brought “firsts” to Capitol Hill, including a change of rules to allow Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) to wear a hijab on the House floor and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez introducing the controversial Green New Deal resolution that has put socialism in the spotlight.

When Jennifer Wexton (D-VA) was sworn in in January, she was the first to hang a transgender flag outside of her office in the Longworth Office Building.

“When I was sworn in less than three months ago I was the only member of Congress to hang a transgender flag outside of my office,” Wexton said on Thursday at a press conference announcing the passage in the House of a resolution to oppose President Donald Trump’s order that members of the U.S. military must serve according to their biological sex at birth.

“It attracted some attention,” Wexton said. “But I would suggest that all of you go over to any of the office buildings across the street after this press conference and you will see scores of the same flag hanging outside of members’ offices proudly.”

“And I hung the flag not just because this community is under attack from the current administration but because the transgender community are my family and my friends,” said Wexton, who has told reporters she is an aunt to a transgender child.

“And guess what? They’re your family and your friends too,” Wexton said, adding that she believes Trump’s decision is based not on facts but “bigotry” and “hate.”

Media and social media has revealed that other lawmakers are following suit by hanging transgender flags, some in support of the transgenders in the military resolution and also to mark International Transgender Day of Visibility on Sunday.

I got a message from a mom of a transgender teen in #CA25. She saw my colleagues hanging flags in honor of #TransVisibilityWeek and asked me to do the same — I was proud to say ours is already up.

“I got a message from a mom of a transgender teen in #CA25. She saw my colleagues hanging flags in honor of #TransVisibilityWeek and asked me to do the same — I was proud to say ours is already up,” announced Rep. Katie Hill (D-CA), who ran as a bisexual candidate and is married to a man.

“The halls of Congress are decked out to show our trans community #WontBeErased!” Hill tweeted.

Ben Rhodes, a former national security aide to President Barack Obama, told the New York Times this week that the “donor class” had prevented Obama from taking more anti-Israel steps than the administration had wanted to take.

Rhodes spoke to author Nathan Thrall for a feature article titled, “How the Battle Over Israel and Anti-Semitism Is Fracturing American Politics.” The headline describes “politics,” but Thrall focused on policy debates within the Democratic Party, which has seen the rise of an assertive anti-Israel constituency in recent years. That constituency has included overtly and unabashedly antisemitic critics, largely but not exclusively from the Muslim community.

Thrall writes about the “boycott, divestment, sanctions” (BDS) movement, which seeks to isolate Israel as apartheid South Africa was once isolated — a comparison that BDS critics find not only factually wrong, but also offensive.

Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), whose recent antisemitic remarks sparked turmoil within the House Democratic caucus, supports BDS (though Omar suggested otherwise to voters in her Minnesota’ district during the 2018 election).

One of Omar’s most notorious remarks was, “It’s all about the Benjamins,” followed by a claim that the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) bribes members of Congress to support Israel. (AIPAC does not endorse or donate to candidates.) Thrall notes that Jewish donors do figure disproportionately among the Democratic Party’s largest donors — though he allows that few of them “prioritize pro-Israel policies above all other issues.”

Enter Rhodes — one of the architects of the Iran nuclear deal, which was vehemently opposed by Israel and by pro-Israel Americans. He blamed Jewish donors for the Obama administration’s supposed restraint towards Israel:

According to Ben Rhodes, a former deputy national-security adviser and one of Obama’s closest confidants, several members of the Obama administration wanted to adopt a more assertive policy toward Israel but felt that their hands were tied. “The Washington view of Israel-Palestine is still shaped by the donor class,” Rhodes, who does not support B.D.S., told me, when I met with him at the Obama Foundation in October. “The donor class is profoundly to the right of where the activists are, and frankly, where the majority of the Jewish community is.”

Rhodes’s claims were echoed by “[a]nother former member of the Obama White House,” who told Thrall that the Obama administration had prevailed upon the United Nations Security Council to delay a vote against Israeli settlements in Judea and Samaria (the West Bank) to after the 2016 election. (The resolution also declared Israel’s presence in eastern Jerusalem — including the Jewish Quarter of the Old City, inhabited by Jews for millennia — to be illegal.)

But these claims are contradicted by the fact that after the Obama administration abstained, allowing such an anti-Israel resolution to pass for the first time, Jewish donors (and voters) hardly bolted from the Democratic Party.

Thrall noted: “The fear of losing Jewish donors as the party moves left on Israel may well be overstated.” He also observed that many Jewish donors to the Democratic Party have left-wing views on Israel. Yet the antisemitic canard that Jews use money to control U.S. foreign policy persists within the Democratic Party at the highest levels, and is used by insiders like Rhodes as an excuse — a scapegoat — to deflect criticism of insufficiently radical policy stances.

Notably, Rhodes was appointed by President Obama to the board of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council in the closing days of his administration. It was a controversial appointment, given Rhodes’s role as the “Iran deal salesman,” and Iran’s leading role in promoting Holocaust denial worldwide as an official ideology.

The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California ruled Friday that California’s ban on ammunition magazines holding more than ten rounds violates the Second Amendment.

On June 29, 2017, Breitbart News reported that U.S. District Judge Roger Benitez blocked the implementation of California’s “high-capacity” magazine ban two days before it was to go into effect. He noted that the ban could not survive the test of District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), noting: “When the simple test of Heller is applied … the statute is adjudged an unconstitutional abridgment.”

On July 17, 2018, a three-judge panel from the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld Benitez’s ruling, voting 2-to-1 against the ban and sending the case back to Benitez.

On March 29, 2019, Benitez again ruled against the ban, issuing an order barring California Attorney General Xavier Becerra from enforcing the ban.

Benitez again relied upon Heller, noting that “millions of ammunition magazines able to hold more than 10 rounds are in common use by law-abiding responsible citizens for lawful uses like self-defense. This is enough to decide that a magazine able to hold more than 10 rounds passes the Heller test.“

The case is Duncan v. Becerra, No. 2:17-cv-56-81 in the U.S. District Court for Southern California.

The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California ruled Friday that California’s ban on ammunition magazines holding more than ten rounds violates the Second Amendment.

On June 29, 2017, Breitbart News reported that U.S. District Judge Roger Benitez blocked the implementation of California’s “high-capacity” magazine ban two days before it was to go into effect. He noted that the ban could not survive the test of District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), noting: “When the simple test of Heller is applied … the statute is adjudged an unconstitutional abridgment.”

On July 17, 2018, a three-judge panel from the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld Benitez’s ruling, voting 2-to-1 against the ban and sending the case back to Benitez.

On March 29, 2019, Benitez again ruled against the ban, issuing an order barring California Attorney General Xavier Becerra from enforcing the ban.

President Donald Trump announced Friday that Small Business Administrator Linda McMahon was leaving his cabinet and taking a position on his 2020 political action committee.

Trump announced the news during a short press conference on Friday at his club at Mar-a-Lago with McMahon and thanked her for her service to the country.

“This is an outstanding woman who has done an outstanding job,” Trump said. “And Linda I want to thank you very much.”

He hinted that he would appoint someone to replace McMahon “soon” and that it would be someone that was well known by the administration that would “fit beautifully” with his cabinet.

“Our country is doing really well, we’re the hottest country in the world economically and it’s going to stay that way for a long time to come,” Trump said.

President Trump must use his executive powers to take action on the soaring levels of illegal and unchecked immigration to the United States rather than delivering “empty threats,” columnist Michelle Malkin says.

In an exclusive interview with SiriusXM Patriot’s Breitbart News Daily, Malkin said Trump’s threats to close the U.S.-Mexico border to stop illegal immigration must be backed up with action, not just rhetoric.

Malkin said:

I don’t want to hear empty threats anymore about how he’s going to do what he should have done many, many, many months ago. The fact that you have a massive number now of … strangers bringing in children, tells you that the very magnet that he says he understands is causing this. The failure to just go ahead executively and fix the asylum system, proves him right on that and yet he’s not doing what he can do as president with his executive authority. [Emphasis added]

“What are you waiting for,” Malkin asked Trump. “Do it.”

Malkin said Trump should have the military at the southern border, asking rhetorically “Does he believe his own rhetoric or not?”

More blame for the levels of illegal immigration the country is currently experiencing should be placed with elected Republicans, Malkin said, who failed to take any action on immigration while controlling the House and Senate for the first two years of Trump’s term.

“Faux pro-borders Republicans … deserve a heck of a lot more scrutiny and condemnation for putting us in the situation that we’re in,” Malkin said.

Trump, Malkin said, must be vigilant in changing immigration policy and statute:

Here’s my fear, is that you know the conventional establishment talking point this week on immigration — even as these hordes of people are coming in unprecedented numbers — is ‘Oh, we got a few billion from the Pentagon for the fencing.’ And it just lulls the base into this false sense of hope that something is being done when we could have Congresspeople in Washington, themselves, putting pressure on Trump to exercise his inherent executive authority to actually do more than just put a few more dozen miles of physical barriers. And I’m not saying that we don’t need [a wall] but what needs to happen is that the policies need to change. [Emphasis added]

As Breitbart News has chronicled, the U.S. is set to admit anywhere between one to 1.5 million illegal aliens this year. The Trump administration’s most recent expansion of the Catch and Release policy has resulted in the release of about 24,000 border crossers and illegal aliens in just two weeks. Simultaneously, experts project that at the current rate of illegal immigration, up to 500,000 illegal aliens could successfully cross into the country this year, undetected by Border Patrol.

Republican voters rank deporting illegal aliens and ending illegal immigration as their top priority to ensure a better quality of life for themselves and their middle class families, the latest Pew Research Center survey revealed.

Former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach says President Trump’s delivery of wage hikes through stricter immigration enforcement in the interior of the United States has been a “massive accomplishment” for America’s blue-collar and working-class communities.

During a debate for IntelligenceSquared, Kobach touted Trump’s “Hire American” economy, which has delivered increased blue-collar and working-class wages by between 3.4 percent and four percent in the last 12 months.

“By reducing illegal immigration, you drive up wages, especially in unskilled labor categories,” Kobach said. “Therefore, [blue-collar workers] have seen those wage gains, and [Trump] has delivered.”

Kobach said:

In terms of wages, in the last 12 months, we’ve seen a 3.4 percent increase in nominal wages. That’s extraordinary, the largest wage gains in the last 12 years. It is a massive achievement for the working, blue-collar voter, and that’s why blue-collar voters in exit polls voted 66 percent for Donald Trump in the last election. He’s the only one that can pull it off again. [Emphasis added] [The wage gains are] a direct result of his positions and his policies on his signature campaign issue, which of course is immigration. President Trump has done what no other presidential candidate has done in recent years, made that a centerpiece issue and has governed with that as a centerpiece issue. He has recognized that illegal immigration really does affect all of us. Every state is a border state now. [Emphasis added]

Those wage hikes for America’s working and lower middle class and a populist-nationalist agenda are what must continue for Trump to capture states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan — as he did in 2016 — in the upcoming 2020 presidential election.

“I don’t know if any Republican can do what Trump did in those blue-collar states [of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin] and break through the Rust Belt,” Kobach said. “The party, after Trump, we may be toast if we don’t find somebody who has his special sauce who can connect with voters in those three states.”

Wage hikes for blue-collar and working-class Americans, though, are increasingly threatened by the record levels of illegal immigration coming across the U.S.-Mexico border, as well as the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) mass release of border crossers and illegal aliens into the interior of the country in recent months.

In just two weeks, 24,000 border crossers and illegal aliens have been released into interior of the U.S. https://t.co/u6gIClDF2t — John Binder 👽 (@JxhnBinder) March 26, 2019

Unfettered illegal immigration — along with the country’s mass legal immigration policy, where more than 1.2 million mostly unskilled foreign nationals are added to the population every year to compete against Americans for jobs — has kept Americans’ wages stagnant and low for decades.

Every one percent increase in the immigrant composition of American workers’ occupations reduces their weekly wages by about 0.5 percent, researcher Steven Camarotta has found. This means the average native-born American worker today has his weekly wages reduced by perhaps 8.5 percent because of current legal immigration levels — not factoring in the wage depression caused by illegal immigration.

In a state like Florida, where immigrants make up about 25.4 percent of the labor force, American workers have their weekly wages reduced by perhaps more than 12.5 percent. In California, where immigrants make up 34 percent of the labor force, American workers’ weekly wages are reduced by potentially 17 percent.

Likewise, every one percent increase in the immigrant composition of low-skilled U.S. occupations reduces wages by about 0.8 percent. Should 15 percent of low-skilled jobs be held by foreign-born workers, it would reduce the wages of native-born American workers by perhaps 12 percent.

In 2017, foreign-born residents made up more than 17 percent of the total U.S. workforce, comprising about 27.4 million foreign workers who compete against American workers for jobs. In occupations that have been relieved by stricter immigration enforcement, like dairy farming, U.S. wages have risen and so have working conditions as employers seek to attract talent in a tight labor market.

DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen will allow the importation of 30,000 extra foreign laborers for landscapers, resorts, and other businesses despite President Donald Trump’s “Hire American” promise that has helped raise blue-collar wages by four percent in 2018.

The decision will allow companies to import 96,000 H-2B laborers in 2019, up from the 66,000 allowed by the law.

NEW – DHS Sec Kirstjen Nielsen is asking for immediate action from Congress to address a “dire situation” at the border including a request for new authority to send unaccompanied minors back to their home countries. “Now we face a system-wide meltdown,” she wrote in a letter. pic.twitter.com/NMocGkaXVS — Katherine Faulders (@KFaulders) March 28, 2019

DHS spokeswoman Andrea Palermo explained Nielsen’s decision:

The Secretary continues to urge lawmakers to pursue a long-term legislative fix that both meets employers’ temporary needs while fulfilling the President’s Buy American and Hire American Executive Order to spur higher wages and employment rates for workers in the United States and to protect their economic interests.

Nielsen also said Congress should decide how many workers should be imported even though Congress allows companies to import at least one million visa workers each year — including at least 66,000 H-2B laborers — just as four million young Americans enter the job market.

Palermo said:

But the truth is that Congress is in the best position to know the appropriate number of H-2B visas that American businesses should be allocated without harming U.S. workers. Therefore, Congress – not DHS – should be responsible for determining whether the annual numerical limitations for H-2B workers set by Congress need to be modified, and by how much, and for setting parameters to ensure that enough workers are available to meet employers’ temporary needs throughout the year.

Many Democratic and GOP legislators want to provide employers with more workers, but they also know the H-2B program is unpopular. Since 2016, the legislators have repeatedly passed the buck to DHS by allowing the DHS secretary to authorize extra visas. This trick ensures that lobbyists and legislators apply closed-d00r pressure to get extra visas from the DHS secretary while also shielding the legislators from public opposition.

In 2018, Congress also voted to block Trump’s pro-American immigration reforms.

In February 2019, Congress quietly allowed Nielsen to provide up to 69,320 extra visas in a section added to the 2019 budget drafted by a small group of GOP and Democratic legislators. She approved 30,000 of the 69,320 — so loosening pressure on seasonal companies to find alternatives for the 2020 season.

Nielsen’s compromise reduces the opposition she faces in Congress as she tries to manage the sprawling DHS agency amid a migration wave from Central America.

H-2B workers can stay up to three years, depending on approval from the Department of Labor, so the resident population of H-2B workers may be far larger than the apparent 2019 limit of 96,000.

Company owners — especially the labor brokers who lease H-2Bs to many resorts and farms — want far more H-2Bs than Congress dare approve. For example, a landscaper in New Jersey called for one million H-2Bs:

#H2B what i just went through this morning. Well i will just say. We are not working today. Americans and Americanized no shows after 3days. 30k, we need the 69k.

There should be 1mil. Opened to stop illegal crossing. — Dennis Kaminski (@DennisKaminski8) March 29, 2019

Nielsen’s expansion of the program was slammed by pro-American groups.

“While Congress shoulders much of the blame for inexplicably authorizing an H-2B visa increase in the first place, the decision to actually go through with one was squarely in the hands of the Trump administration,” said a statement from Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform. The statement continued:

[W]hen given the opportunity to stand with the American worker, President Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen capitulated to the self-serving demands of business lobbyists and authorized 30,000 additional visas. While the economy is certainly roaring, it does not need a vast infusion of guest workers. This decision to allow tens of thousands more foreign workers to flood the labor market this year will not only suppress blue-collar wage growth but also take away opportunities from Americans trying to get back into the labor force. It begs the question – does anyone in this administration, including the president himself, still care about American workers who have been hit hard by mass immigration? Every word out of the president’s mouth lately seems to be that we need more foreign workers, yet one of this administration’s very first initiatives was to “Buy American, Hire American.” How ironic. An improving economy with thousands of new jobs can tighten the labor market, increase wages, and put Americans back to work. We’ve waited a long time for the stars to align, yet this opportunity is being squandered by influential business interests and negative forces within the administration, addicted to cheap foreign labor. This cycle of growth and subsequent flooding of the labor market has to stop. It is antithetical to the goal, promised to us by the Trump administration, of putting Americans first.

Numbers USA also slammed the gift to business:

DHS announces it will make 30,000 *more* H-2B guest workers available. Is this what @realDonaldTrump means by putting American workers first?

https://t.co/QEY3funQUi — NumbersUSA (@NumbersUSA) March 29, 2019

The infusion of new labor will allow companies to complete more seasonal contracts for landscaping, resort, foresty, stabling horses, and other work such as the supply of crabmeat from the Chesapeake Bay. The crabmeat business is important for the H-2B industry, partly because it is used to persuade crab-eating, D.C.-based, white-collar journalists that the H-2B program is vital for business.

Companies say they often pay good wages to their imported H-2B workers, often around $15 per hour. But that price is below the wages sought by Americans for the seasonal work which leaves them jobless in the off-season. The lower wages paid to H-2Bs also allows companies to pay lower wages to their American supervisors.

Many legislators, such as North Carolina GOP Sen. Thom Tillis, loudly or quietly, support the program partly because many companies have built their business around the promise of government-supplied labor.

But the DHS allocates H-2B workers via a process of lobbying, lawyers, and lotteries — not by market prices.

For example, many competing companies sign contracts for seasonal work and then ask the government for a suitable number of H-2B laborers. When Company A gets more H-2B laborers than Company B, it gets to complete more season work and establish a commercial advantage over Company B and other nearby companies who get fewer H-2Bs.

This flawed process forces many companies to lobby for a share of the H-2B foreign workers instead of painfully changing, curbing, and automating their business practices to match the cost of hiring Americans for seasonal work. This competitive chase for H-2B workers also ensures many companies quickly become dependent on the program — and can plausibly claim that they will go out of business unless they keep getting H-2B workers.

This allocation process also does little to deter corruption and poor treatment of H-2B workers or the rejection of Americans who lose jobs in rural communities to imported H-2Bs.

The companies, especially the landscaping industry, have repeatedly blocked reform proposals, including calls for the H-2B visas to be allocated to the companies that offer to pay the highest salaries. That reform would penalize companies that try to import cheap H-2B instead of hiring Americans at the market rate for seasonal work.

The H-2A program is just one of many visa programs that are used to suppress Americans’ salaries and wages while aiding CEOs and investors.

For example, the government awarded visas for 242,762 H-2A farm laborers in 2018, up from 200,049 visas in 2017 and 165,741 visas in 2016. That is a 45 percent rise in three years — although it is offset by a claimed reduction in illegal immigrant farm workers.

But there are far more white-collar visa workers in the United States, ensuring a greater impact on white-collar wages. In 2018, there were are at least 1.5 million white-collar visa workers in the United States, including roughly one million graduates with H-1Bs visas, roughly 400,000 OPT and CPT white-collar workers, 100,000 H4EAD workers, perhaps 100,000 workers with TN visas, at least 200,000 people with L-1 visas, plus additional populations with 0-1, E-3, J-1, or B-1 visas.

The is a huge population that is roughly twice as many workers as the 800,000 Americans who graduate with skilled technical degrees from universities each year

Also, the 1.5 million estimate does not include visa workers who have stayed beyond their visa terms and use faked work permits to keep white-collar jobs.

The army of white-collar visa workers may have helped to keep salary growth for white-collar Americans at just two percent in 2018.

Many polls show the public opposes guest workers as a threat to their salaries and jobs. An August 2017 poll reported that 68 percent of Americans oppose companies’ use of white-collar H-1Bs visas to outsource U.S.-based jobs that could be held by American graduates. More than one million foreign college graduates now hold visa jobs in the United States.

But the DHS allocates H-2B workers via a process of lobbying, lawyers, and lotteries — not by market prices.

For example, many competing companies sign contracts for seasonal work and then ask the government for a suitable number of H-2B laborers. When Company A gets more H-2B laborers than Company B, it gets to complete more season work and establish a commercial advantage over Company B and other nearby companies who get fewer H-2Bs.

This flawed process forces many companies to lobby for a share of the H-2B foreign workers instead of painfully changing, curbing, and automating their business practices to match the cost of hiring Americans for seasonal work. This competitive chase for H-2B workers also ensures many companies quickly become dependent on the program — and can plausibly claim that they will go out of business unless they keep getting H-2B workers.

This allocation process also does little to deter corruption and poor treatment of H-2B workers or the rejection of Americans who lose jobs in rural communities to imported H-2Bs.

The companies, especially the landscaping industry, have repeatedly blocked reform proposals, including calls for the H-2B visas to be allocated to the companies that offer to pay the highest salaries. That reform would penalize companies that try to import cheap H-2B instead of hiring Americans at the market rate for seasonal work.

The H-2A program is just one of many visa programs that are used to suppress Americans’ salaries and wages while aiding CEOs and investors.

For example, the government awarded visas for 242,762 H-2A farm laborers in 2018, up from 200,049 visas in 2017 and 165,741 visas in 2016. That is a 45 percent rise in three years — although it is offset by a claimed reduction in illegal immigrant farm workers.

But there are far more white-collar visa workers in the United States, ensuring a greater impact on white-collar wages. In 2018, there were are at least 1.5 million white-collar visa workers in the United States, including roughly one million graduates with H-1Bs visas, roughly 400,000 OPT and CPT white-collar workers, 100,000 H4EAD workers, perhaps 100,000 workers with TN visas, at least 200,000 people with L-1 visas, plus additional populations with 0-1, E-3, J-1, or B-1 visas.

The is a huge population that is roughly twice as many workers as the 800,000 Americans who graduate with skilled technical degrees from universities each year

Also, the 1.5 million estimate does not include visa workers who have stayed beyond their visa terms and use faked work permits to keep white-collar jobs.

The army of white-collar visa workers may have helped to keep salary growth for white-collar Americans at just two percent in 2018.

Many polls show the public opposes guest workers as a threat to their salaries and jobs. An August 2017 poll reported that 68 percent of Americans oppose companies’ use of white-collar H-1Bs visas to outsource U.S.-based jobs that could be held by American graduates. More than one million foreign college graduates now hold visa jobs in the United States.


Today is a day that will go down in history of one of Britain’s finest hours: Brexit Day.

Well that was the plan, at any rate.

March 29th was a date which quickened the pulses of every Brexiteer. It was the one we’d marked in our diaries for all the amazing parties we planned to throw to celebrate our newfound independence from the European superstate; the moment when — to borrow the phrase of Brexiteer Dan Hannan — we finally managed to unshackle ourselves from the corpse.

That’s because under the terms voted for by parliament, March 29th was officially the date when the June 2016 referendum vote would be honoured and Britain would formally leave the European Union.

But guess what…

We’re not leaving, after all.

God knows what’s going to happen next. I certainly don’t. Anyone who pretends he does is deluded.

What I can tell you is this: the people who voted for Brexit aren’t going to go away and they haven’t changed their mind. On the contrary, I believe people’s appetite for Brexit is stronger than it has ever been.

One of the things that pleasantly surprised me at today’s Brexit rally outside the Houses of Parliament in London was the number of people I’d met who had originally voted Remain but were now ardent Brexiteers.

Some had originally bought into the Project Fear myths of the Establishment-driven Remain campaign; others had simply gone along with Remain thinking that a rift with the EU would be too disruptive. Now they’d just had enough of the European Union and wanted out.

The other thing that pleasantly surprised me about the rally was the overwhelming sense of optimism. It helped, no doubt, that the weather was lovely – arranged, of course, by God who is an ardent Brexiteer and despises the European Union which is why he populated its upper ranks with slithy creatures like Jean-Claude Juncker and Guy Verhofstadt and the sinister Martin Selmayr.

‘Betrayal’, ‘May’s Deal Is Not Brexit At All’: Brexiteers React to the Day Britain Should Have Left the EU https://t.co/SX2df71aHn — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 29, 2019

Everyone there was blithely confident that Brexit is going to happen one day regardless of what the political class might attempt to do to prevent it.

You could call this naivety. And from the perspective of the political class – and most of the commentators and think tankers who hang out with the political class like victims of Stockholm syndrome – I’m sure that it is.

After all, most experts have been telling us that accepting Theresa May’s glitter-dipped turd of a Withdrawal Agreement was the last chance of getting even a semblance of Brexit – and that from now on all we can hope for is ever more watered down versions thereof.

The error of this official Westminster-sanctioned point of view, it seems to me, is that we’re already in terrain where the old rules no longer apply.

Rather, we’re in the realm of chaos where no one knows anything and where anything could happen, including the radical transformation of Britain’s political system in a way that has not been seen in generations, or indeed in centuries.

Britain doesn’t have a written constitution but it does have longstanding parliamentary traditions which have been celebrated and respected across the world as that of a mature and wise and just democracy.

BREAKING: May's loses Brexit 'deal' vote 286-344 https://t.co/JLvmeuKJoZ — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 29, 2019

But if the demos no longer believe that that democracy is doing the job it is supposed to, if they’ve completely lost their faith in the system’s ability to represent their interests justly, then surely all bets are off.

Britain doesn’t really do revolutions. We’re not like the French. But that doesn’t mean there haven’t been occasions in our history when we’ve said “enough is enough” and challenged what we see as the arbitrary power of an overweening and unchecked state. Magna Carta; the Civil War…

I don’t think we’re heading for extreme violence or anything like that. But I do think very much that the impulse that led 17.4 million people to vote for Brexit is going to get stronger and stronger – and that if the political class doesn’t want to have a very miserable time then it really needs to recognise this fact sooner rather than later.

If I were an insurgent politician like Nigel Farage, I’d feel very happy right now. These are very interesting times and they’re going to get a lot more interesting still.

President Trump’s National Security Advisor John Bolton has offered some words of assurances to the British people on the day the UK was supposed to leave the European Union, saying the United States is eager to do a bilateral trade deal and the UK remains at “top of the queue.”

“People who worry about the UK ‘crashing out’ of the European Union — that’s the phrase they use — they’re going to ‘crash’ right into the United States,” Mr Bolton told Sky News’s Cordelia Lynch from the White House on Friday.

“We’re standing here waiting to make a trade deal with a United Kingdom independent of the European Union,” Mr Bolton continued, in an optimistic note.

“I don’t want to get into the specifics of what’s been going on in the House of Commons, but I can say unequivocally President Trump is eager for the will of the British people to be carried out and he is even more eager to do a trade deal,” he said.

At the time of the historic 2016 vote, and since, President Donald Trump has been a supporter of Brexit and the prospect of a strong U.S.-UK bilateral trade deal.

Prime Minister Theresa May lost her third vote on her EU-approved Withdrawal Agreement from the bloc, today, on the day the country was scheduled to leave the European Union.

Remainer forces within the House of Commons that want to stay as closely aligned to the EU as possible continue to press for May’s deal, but with an added Customs Union — where the UK would maintain the same tariffs and trade policies as the EU — which would threaten a UK-U.S. bilateral deal.

“The President wants to deal with a Britain that can change some of the rules on trade we think disfavours the United States when it’s in connection with the European Union,” Mr Bolton said on the issue of the obstructive Customs Union.

“Honestly, from the U.S. point of view — and for that matter, the UK point of view — I don’t understand why you would want to get out of the EU and not be able to set your own rules.

“That’s what independence means and that’s what the President wants to do. He think that the EU rules discriminate against American trade, and he wants a free, fare, and reciprocal trade with Great Britain.”

“But it really is quite important for the President for the people of Britain to know that this is the top of the priority. This is not the Obama administration where Britain would go ‘to the back of the queue’ — which, of course, is not an American phrase. Britain will be at the top of the queue for us.”

Asked whether he agreed with Nigel Farage whether today was a “day of shame,” the diplomat said, “I think Britain had a referendum, the Leave vote won in what everybody agrees was a free and fair election; doesn’t the will of the British people get to be carried out?”

According to U.S. defense officials quoted by the Washington Free Beacon on Wednesday, China is developing a long-range cruise missile that can be hidden inside shipping containers and launched from civilian freighters, a type of ship China happens to own in abundance.

The missile is described as the land-attack version of a high-end anti-ship missile called the YJ-18C. This Chinese anti-ship missile is, in turn, a variation of a Russian system that could be disguised as a shipping container.

As the Free Beacon pointed out, the idea of turning cargo ships into missile launch platforms is not new, but it is especially worrisome in China’s case given its aggressive posture, the huge number of container ships it has access to, and its enthusiasm for buying up civilian port facilities as part of the Belt and Road trade and infrastructure initiative. Weapons disguised as shipping containers could be launched from civilian ports at military facilities, and could remain undiscovered for a very long time in storage.

“China operates or is building deep water ports in several strategic locations, including Bahamas, Panama, and Jamaica that could be used covertly to deploy ships carrying the YJ-18C,” the Free Beacon noted.

Analysts also feared China might pass its shipping-container missiles along to rogue-state clients such as North Korea and Iran.

Several of the experts quoted by the Free Beacon mentioned the possibility that the relatively short-range container-launched cruise missiles could be fitted with electromagnetic pulse (EMP) warheads, giving them the ability to disrupt electronic equipment and electric power within a few hundred miles of civilian ports and shipping lanes.

China and its all-weather ally Pakistan are reportedly furious with the United States for pushing a draft resolution this week to outlaw the Pakistani leader of an anti-India, U.S.-designated terrorist group directly to the United Nations Security Council, bypassing established procedures.

Voice of America (VOA) reports:

Washington circulated the resolution to the 15-member council on Wednesday with the support of France and Britain to designate Masood Azhar, the head of Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), a global terrorist. The move came two weeks after Beijing blocked a similar U.S.-sponsored resolution at the U.N. anti-terrorism “1267 sanctions committee”, which China insists is the authorized U.N. body to deal by consensus with the listing issues.

Responding to the recent U.S. move, Geng Shuang, a spokesman for China’s foreign ministry, reportedly urged the United States to “act cautiously” and avoid “forcefully” pushing the draft resolution.

“This is not in line with [the] resolution of the issue through dialogue and negotiations. This has reduced the authority of the committee as a main anti-terrorism body of the UNSC, and this is not conducive to the solidarity and only complicates the issue,” Geng added.

Pakistan also rebuked America’s new effort to label the JeM chief a global terrorist once and for all.

Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Faisal recently told reporters:

Such efforts to circumvent the established machinery for this purpose will only weaken the 1267 regime. …Any action outside the committee will undermine the integrity of the sanctions regime and must be avoided. Pakistan remains committed to [fulfilling] its obligations under the U.N. sanctions committee.

Beijing and Islamabad have repeatedly blocked U.S.-led efforts, backed by Pakistan’s regional rival India, to declare the JeM chief a global terrorist.

China prevented the U.N. committee from sanctioning the JeM chief in 2016, 2017, and again this year.

JeM claimed responsibility for the deadly February 14 attack in the Indian-held portion of the disputed Muslim-majority Kashmir region, which drove nuclear-armed India and Pakistan to the brink of another war.

However, Islamabad has asked New Delhi to provide more evidence on the group’s involvement in the suicide assault, which left over 40 Indian forces dead, marking one of the deadliest attacks in the region.

“India on Thursday expressed disappointment over Pakistan’s response to its dossier on Jaish-e-Mohammed’s involvement in the dastardly Pulwama attack [in Indian-held Kashmir], saying Islamabad continues to be in ‘denial’ on the issue of cross border terrorism, the Press Trust of Indian (PTI) notes.

India and Pakistan have already fought two major wars and a minor conflict over Kashmir, home to competing claims for territory by Beijing, its ally Islamabad, and mutual rival New Delhi.

On numerous occasions, U.S., Indian, and Afghan officials have accused Pakistan of harboring terrorist groups like JeM, an assertion that Islamabad and Beijing continue to deny.

China and Pakistan are closed military and financial allies. While Pakistan refuses to condemn the reported mistreatment of Muslims in China’s Xinjiang province, Beijing has repeatedly defended Islamabad against accusations of serving as a sanctuary for terrorists.

According to the U.S. government, China faces a terrorist threat from jihadis training and operating in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region, which houses the highest concentration of terrorist groups in the world.

China’s Muslim-majority Xinjiang province borders Pakistan-held Kashmir.

Beijing tends to stay in the shadows of Kashmir-linked military disputes between Pakistan and India, usually backing Islamabad’s position.

Pakistan has ceded control of some of its Kashmir territories to China. Meanwhile, India contests China’s claims to land that sits on the portion of Kashmir it controls.

Beijing urged restraint by India and Pakistan during the recent tensions in Kashmir that resulted in reciprocal air operations by both countries, including a brief dogfight.

“The tensions [in Kashmir] cooled down due to diplomatic interventions by major powers such as the United States, China, Russia, and regional allies, particularly Saudi Arabia,” VOA notes.

Early this month, the U.S. military credited Pakistan with taking action against terrorist groups operating on its soil in recent weeks.

“But India, and even some critics at home, remain skeptical of Pakistan’s counter-terrorism efforts, saying some of the groups, including JeM, allegedly are backed by the country’s military and previous pledges to dismantle these organizations did not produce the desired results,” VOA points out.

Referring to evidence India recently provided to Pakistan highlighting JeM’s involvement in the deadly Kashmir attack, Raveesh Kumar, a spokesperson for New Delhi’s external affairs ministry, said this week, according to PTI.

Harold Thomas Martin III entered a guilty plea at U.S. District Court in Baltimore on Thursday, admitting his role in what could be the worst breach of classified data in U.S. history.

The severity of the breach is measured in terms of how much information Martin looted from the systems he had access to. Fortunately, he does not appear to have done anything with the data he took. His defense lawyers characterized him as a data hoarder, a victim of compulsive mental illness who piled up classified files and sensitive documents the way other hoarders accumulate newspapers or clothes.

After Martin was arrested in 2016, there was speculation he might have been a “whistleblower” in the Edward Snowden mode who lost his nerve, or he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder after his deployment in Operation Desert Storm. Suspicions have been raised that he worked with or inspired the “Shadow Brokers,” an infamous hacker group that exposed some of the powerful software tools the National Security Agency (NSA) used for penetrating foreign computer systems.

As is perhaps inevitable with any case touching upon the shadowy world of cyber espionage, there are many theories about his alarming behavior and the curiously low-key processing of his case – which began with a huge FBI raid compared by eyewitnesses to a military invasion but has received little media attention since.

Martin wound up sitting on about 50 terabytes of data that never should have left the offices he took it from, a hoard prosecutors described as “breathtaking” in scope but rather sloppy in execution, as some of the pilfered material was reportedly stuffed into his car and an unlocked shed in his backyard. The NSA document he pled guilty to stealing is evidently one of the items he left in his car.

Martin stole about 300 times as much information as Snowden, including top-shelf secret spy software and information that could have compromised American agents on dangerous assignments. His data-hoarding career spanned two decades of work for government contractors, including the same one that employed Snowden, Booz Allen Hamilton.

Martin was originally charged with 20 counts of espionage but admitted to one count of “willful retention of national defense information,” for which the 54-year-old could serve up to nine years in prison. The two and a half years he has already been in custody will reportedly be credited against his sentence.


The Georgia House gave its final approval Friday to legislation that will ban abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected.

The bill passed 92–78, with 91 needed for approval, and it now heads to Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, who said he will sign it into law.

Georgia values life. We stand up for the innocent and speak for those who cannot speak for themselves. The legislature’s bold action reaffirms our priorities and who we are as a state. I thank these lawmakers for their leadership and applaud their undeniable courage. #gapol — Brian Kemp (@BrianKempGA) March 29, 2019

“Georgia values life,” Kemp tweeted after the vote. “We stand up for the innocent and speak for those who cannot speak for themselves.”

“The legislature’s bold action reaffirms our priorities and who we are as a state,” he added. “I thank these lawmakers for their leadership and applaud their undeniable courage.”

Kemp said the “efforts to protect life do not end here,” as he promoted an easing of “the adoption process,” a search for “loving homes for those in foster care,” and protection for “the aging & vulnerable.”

Our efforts to protect life do not end here. We must work to ease the adoption process, find loving homes for those in foster care, protect the aging & vulnerable. Together, we will ensure that all Georgians are safe & have the opportunity to live, grow, learn, & prosper. #gapol — Brian Kemp (@BrianKempGA) March 29, 2019

State Rep. Ed Setzler, who sponsored House Bill 481, said the legislation is something that “commonsense Georgians” should be proud of, reported the Atlanta-Journal Constitution.

“This bill recognizes the fundamental life of the child in the womb is worthy of legal protection and balances that basic right to life with the very different situations women find themselves in in pregnancies,” he said.

In an exclusive comment to Breitbart News, Concerned Women for America (CWA) of Georgia representative Jane Robbins said the legislation is “the most historic pro-life legislation passed in Georgia since Roe v. Wade.”

“The legislators faced withering pressure from pro-abortion forces, including the predictable outrage from Hollywood, but by and large they held firm to their principles,” she added. “CWA is very grateful to all the Georgia leaders who helped get this bill over the finish line.”

Democrat State Rep. Vernon Jones said the approval of the bill could cause Republicans to lose power in the State House.

“If your members vote for this bill in 2020, your party loses,” Jones said. “There’s going to be a new speaker of the House here. If there’s a new speaker, many in your party will lose power, all of you will lose your chairmanships. If you all lose based on this bill, this body is going to change over.”

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Georgia has already announced it will bring a lawsuit to challenge the legislation.

“If Governor Kemp signs this abortion ban bill into law, the ACLU has one message: We will see you in court,” said Andrea Young, executive director.

Planned Parenthood also condemned the legislation, tweeting, “To the politicians in Georgia and everywhere who are after our rights, we see through your lies.”

In addition to pro-life lawmakers’ ability to withstand protests by the “Handmaids” abortion-rights supporters, most recently, a group of Hollywood writers and elite celebrities, spearheaded by actress Alyssa Milano, threatened to boycott the state if the “heartbeat” abortion ban passed:

In a letter, signed by celebrities such as Alec Baldwin and Sarah Silverman, the actors threatened Georgia lawmakers:

We can’t imagine being elected officials who had to say to their constituents, “I enacted a law that was so evil, it chased billions of dollars out of our state’s economy.” It’s not the most effective campaign slogan, but rest assured we’ll make it yours should it come to pass.

The celebrities threatened to move their film and television industry to “a safer state for women if H.B. 481 becomes law.”


The Georgia House gave its final approval Friday to legislation that will ban abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected.

The bill passed 92–78, with 91 needed for approval, and it now heads to Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, who said he will sign it into law.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said Thursday he plans to investigate whether the San Antonio City Council violated the First Amendment when it banned Chick-fil-A from participating as a vendor at the city’s airport because of the restaurant’s support for Christian values:

The City of San Antonio’s decision to exclude Chick-fil-A based on the religious beliefs associated with the company and its owners is the opposite of tolerance. It’s discriminatory, and not only out of step with Texas values, but inconsistent with the Constitution and Texas law. pic.twitter.com/iOk7G9Eltv — Ken Paxton (@KenPaxtonTX) March 28, 2019

Gov. Greg Abbott tweeted the Chick-fil-A ban “has the stench of religious discrimination”:

Texas Sen. Ted Cruz also tweeted about the ban, “The Texas attorney general says it’s ‘discriminatory’”:

Roberto Treviño, San Antonio District 1 City Councilman, moved last week to ban the privately held, family-owned business from its list of airport vendors. Six council members approved the motion to ban Chick-fil-A, while four voted against it.

“With this decision, the City Council reaffirmed the work our city has done to become a champion of equality and inclusion,” Treviño said, according to NBC News 4. “San Antonio is a city full of compassion, and we do not have room in our public facilities for a business with a legacy of anti-LGBTQ behavior.”

However, Texas Rep. Chip Roy tweeted a letter he sent to the San Antonio City Council in which he reacted to Treviño’s comment:

Targeting individuals, organizations, or corporations for carrying out their deeply held religious beliefs in accord with our laws and consistent with many Americans’ similarly held religious beliefs is hardly making San Antonio a champion of ‘equality and inclusion.’”

“The Constitution’s protection of religious liberty is somehow even better than Chick-fil-A’s chicken,” Paxton wrote in a letter to San Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg and the rest of the council, reported Chron.com. “Unfortunately, I have serious concerns that both are under assault at the San Antonio airport.”

Chron.com continued:

Paxton also on Thursday asked Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao to look into whether the city broke any federal law or regulation as a recipient of federal grant funds. In a letter to Chao, Paxton said the city’s action could violate the free exercise clause of the First Amendment. He added that it also could violate federal statutes and regulations that prohibit discrimination on the basis of creed. “Ironically, the city’s efforts to be ‘inclusive’ resulted in the exclusion of Chick-fil-A based on its religious beliefs,” Paxton wrote to Chao.

The news report noted as well that Councilman Greg Brockhouse, who is running for mayor against Nirenberg, responded to Paxton’s announcement about his investigation by calling on the City Council to reconsider its decision.

“This investigation is the result of the City Council’s horrible decision to punish Chick-fil-A for their constitutionally protected rights to freedom of religion,” Brockhouse said. “The City Council must immediately reconvene on this item … to consider revoking this vote moving forward with Chick-fil-A as part of the contract.”

Breitbart News reported on Treviño’s motion to ban Chick-fil-A:

Chick-fil-A was initially set to be one of the airport’s restaurant offerings, but the councilman’s motion came on the heels of a report by extremist organization Think Progress that highlighted the $1.8 million in donations to Christian groups that Chick-fil-A reported to its shareholders. “Everyone has a place here, and everyone should feel welcome when they walk through our airport,” Treviño added. “I look forward to the announcement of a suitable replacement.”

Chick-fil-A states on its website that the company continues to uphold the biblical principles that guided the founding of its business by S. Truett Cathy. The company has given financial support to Christian youth organizations and charitable groups, such as the Salvation Army.

Chick-fil-A continues:

While some have questioned the motives behind our donations, we want to take a moment to reiterate the mission and focus of the Chick-fil-A Foundation, which has always been and always will be to donate to programs that support a diverse array of youth and educational programs nationwide. The 140,000 people who serve customers on a daily basis represent and embrace all people, regardless of race, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation or gender identity.

According to the restaurant’s website, in 2018, Chick-fil-A was presented with a Glassdoor Employees’ Choice Award for being among the top 100 best places to work. Additionally, Chick-fil-A was included in Glassdoor’s Top 100 CEOs.

Also, in 2018, Chick-fil-A was recognized for customer experience in the Temkin Experience Ratings survey, and was named “Best Franchise Brand” by Airport Revenue News.

Chick-fil-A was included as well in 2018 in Forbes’ list of best employers and as a National Society of High School Scholars top employer.

Friday on “Fox & Friends,” House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) responded to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi calling House Republicans “scaredy-cats” for wanting Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) to resign from his position as House Intelligence chairman because he pushed the Russia collusion narrative.

“I think a lot of Pelosi’s poodles out there [are] running scared of the facts, but they’re still trying to chase down witch hunts,” Scalise said. “If that’s what they want to be — the party of just constant harassment of the president, of his family, of allowing babies who were born to be killed when they are outside of the womb. That’s what they’ve become. It’s radical.”

Scalise said Democrats have been “peddling” the “lie” of collusion for two years and will not stop trying to undermine President Donald Trump’s presidency.

“They will never admit they were wrong,” he advised. “They just move on and make some other baseless accusation.”

Members of the Kardashian and Jenner family are thanking the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency for arresting an illegal alien who has twice broken into Kendall Jenner’s home.

“We are extremely appreciative of the hard work by the Los Angeles Police Department and ICE, whose swift response and professionalism led to this man’s apprehension. His actions have not only had a severe impact on Kendall’s life but the entire family’s sense of security, causing us to fear for Kendall’s safety as well as our own,” the family said in a statement to the press.

“Knowing this individual is in custody gives us peace of mind,” the joint message from the Kardashian and Jenner families concluded.

The statement came on the heels of the arrest of John Ford, 38, a Canadian who was convicted twice of breaking into 23-year-old model Kendall Jenner’s Los Angeles home.

ICE apprehended him in a hotel parking lot in Albuquerque, New Mexico, several days ago. Ford was apprehended twice before at Jenner’s home in the Mulholland Estates gated community of Los Angeles. In October of last year, he was caught sneaking around by Jenner’s pool.

Ford was convicted on charges of misdemeanor trespassing.

Jack P. Staton, special agent in charge of El Paso office of ICE’s Homeland Security Operations, said in a statement that Ford’s arrest may have “prevented a violent crime.”

“Our special agents acted quickly on this tip to ensure that this obsessive behavior didn’t escalate to become a tragedy,” Staton said.

“Following his arrest,” ICE reported, “Ford was processed and served with a notice to appear (NTA) before a federal immigration judge; he remains in ICE custody in El Paso, Texas, awaiting disposition of his immigration case.”

President Donald Trump is threatening to close parts of the U.S.-Mexican border as record numbers of migrants surge through the legal loopholes created by Congress and judges.

“CONGRESS MUST CHANGE OUR WEAK IMMIGRATION LAWS NOW … If Mexico doesn’t immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States throug [sic] our Southern Border, I will be CLOSING….. ….the Border, or large sections of the Border, next week,” he said in a series of three tweets Friday morning.

The DEMOCRATS have given us the weakest immigration laws anywhere in the World. Mexico has the strongest, & they make more than $100 Billion a year on the U.S. Therefore, CONGRESS MUST CHANGE OUR WEAK IMMIGRATION LAWS NOW, & Mexico must stop illegals from entering the U.S…. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2019

….through their country and our Southern Border. Mexico has for many years made a fortune off of the U.S., far greater than Border Costs. If Mexico doesn’t immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States throug our Southern Border, I will be CLOSING….. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2019

….the Border, or large sections of the Border, next week. This would be so easy for Mexico to do, but they just take our money and “talk.” Besides, we lose so much money with them, especially when you add in drug trafficking etc.), that the Border closing would be a good thing! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2019

Border officials are ramping up their estimates for the number of migrants who will grab the opportunity created by Congress. Predictions for 2019 have climbed from 900,000 to 1.2 million during the last few weeks.

Others experts suggest the 2019 number may be far larger. A February report from Jim Clifton, the chairman, and CEO at Gallup said:

Forty-two million seekers of citizenship or asylum are watching to determine exactly when and how is the best time to make the move. This suggests that open borders could potentially attract 42 million Latin Americans. A full 5 million who are planning to move in the next 12 months say they are moving to the U.S.

Pro-migration activists pretend migrants are helpless recipients of progressive charity. But migrants are rational & will go to US if Dems & biz force open the border. So Gallup warns that 5 million people are calculating the gains & risks for a 2019 move: https://t.co/nGUr3Q0dXk — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) February 10, 2019

Pro-migration Democrats deny the migrant wave and say it is smaller than the surges seen under President George W. Bush. But the numbers under Bush were high because individual migrants were overcounted as they made repeated attempts to sneak through the border. The current count excludes overcounts because each migrant is counted once before they are released into the United States to move into blue-collar jobs, neighborhoods, and schools.

The growing wave of migrants from Central America is being welcomed as a “humanitarian crisis” by most Democrats leaders because it provides them with a new bloc of ‘dreamer’ illegals who may become voters in the 2030s. The surge is also welcomed because it gives elite progressives an opportunity to simultaneously display favoritism to subordinate outsiders and disdain towards the mass of ordinary Americans who demand respect, civic solidarity, and higher wages.

Business interests welcome the migration because it provides a new block of cheap workers, consumers, and renters, and also because it helps distract Washington from Trump’s “Hire American” policy and his “Four Pillars” immigration reforms. The “Hire American” policy opposed by business groups because it is giving Trump’s voters important pay raises before the 2020 elections.

Business interests will rally to block Trump’s threat to shutter the border until Mexico helps stop the mass migration, which is being aided by new bus lines which ferry migrants up to the U.S. border.

Trump’s statement comes as border official are trying to warn Congress of the problems.

For example, DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said in a Thursday letter to all members of Congress that, “We face a system-wide meltdown … We are witnessing the real-time dissolution of the immigration system.”

She added, “I will be working with the Office of Management and Budget to provide you additional details in the near future, but the situation is so dire we want to make notification to you now that we will require additional resources … to ensure immediate safety and care of individuals in our custody.”

On Monday, border commissioner Kevin McAleenan provided reporters with some details about the Central Americans’ rush into Americans’ society, jobs, and schools. The March inflow alone will include roughly 15,000 parents and 40,000 children in “family units” who will ask for asylum — and then will be released — plus roughly 35,000 single adults who will try to evade border officers, he said.

McAleenan pinned the blame on Congress and the judges who have jointly cut legal holes in the border fences by allowing migrants to stream into U.S. cities, jobs, and schools if they merely ask for asylum, saying:

The increase in family units is a direct response to the vulnerabilities in our legal frameworks where migrants and smugglers know that they will be released and be allowed to stay in the U.S. indefinitely pending immigration proceedings that could be many years out. This is due to court orders that undermine the integrity of our immigration system. There is no questioning [about] why this is happening.

DHS Nielsen: "We are witnessing the real-time dissolution of the immigration system.” GOP: 'Yeah, but donors need more labor, consumers & renters.' Dems: 'Whatevs, we're getting 2032 voters.' Media; 'We're sharing feels with grateful migrants.' Voters: TBD https://t.co/aJuus1JFhj — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) March 29, 2019

Each year, roughly four million young Americans join the workforce after high school or university. The federal government then imports roughly 1.1 million legal immigrants, refreshes a resident population of roughly 1.5 million white-collar guest workers and roughly 500,000 blue-collar visa workers, and it also tolerates about eight million illegal workers.

In 2019 — because of catch-and-release rules mandated by Congress and the courts — the federal government also will likely release at least 350,000 migrant Central American laborers into the U.S. job market even as at least 500,000 more migrants sneak past U.S. border defenses or overstay their visas.

This federal policy of using legal and illegal migration to boost economic growth for investors shifts enormous wealth from young employees towards older investors by flooding the market with cheap white-collar graduates and blue-collar foreign labor.

This cheap labor economic policy forces Americans to compete even for low wage jobs, it widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids’ schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines millions of marginalized Americans, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.

But Trump’s “Hire American” policy has crimped the supply of new workers, so allowing blue-collar Americans to get a four percent wage increase in 2018.

….through their country and our Southern Border. Mexico has for many years made a fortune off of the U.S., far greater than Border Costs. If Mexico doesn’t immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States throug our Southern Border, I will be CLOSING….. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2019

….the Border, or large sections of the Border, next week. This would be so easy for Mexico to do, but they just take our money and “talk.” Besides, we lose so much money with them, especially when you add in drug trafficking etc.), that the Border closing would be a good thing! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2019

Border officials are ramping up their estimates for the number of migrants who will grab the opportunity created by Congress. Predictions for 2019 have climbed from 900,000 to 1.2 million during the last few weeks.

Others experts suggest the 2019 number may be far larger. A February report from Jim Clifton, the chairman, and CEO at Gallup said:

Forty-two million seekers of citizenship or asylum are watching to determine exactly when and how is the best time to make the move. This suggests that open borders could potentially attract 42 million Latin Americans. A full 5 million who are planning to move in the next 12 months say they are moving to the U.S.

Pro-migration activists pretend migrants are helpless recipients of progressive charity. But migrants are rational & will go to US if Dems & biz force open the border. So Gallup warns that 5 million people are calculating the gains & risks for a 2019 move: https://t.co/nGUr3Q0dXk — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) February 10, 2019

Pro-migration Democrats deny the migrant wave and say it is smaller than the surges seen under President George W. Bush. But the numbers under Bush were high because individual migrants were overcounted as they made repeated attempts to sneak through the border. The current count excludes overcounts because each migrant is counted once before they are released into the United States to move into blue-collar jobs, neighborhoods, and schools.

The growing wave of migrants from Central America is being welcomed as a “humanitarian crisis” by most Democrats leaders because it provides them with a new bloc of ‘dreamer’ illegals who may become voters in the 2030s. The surge is also welcomed because it gives elite progressives an opportunity to simultaneously display favoritism to subordinate outsiders and disdain towards the mass of ordinary Americans who demand respect, civic solidarity, and higher wages.

Business interests welcome the migration because it provides a new block of cheap workers, consumers, and renters, and also because it helps distract Washington from Trump’s “Hire American” policy and his “Four Pillars” immigration reforms. The “Hire American” policy opposed by business groups because it is giving Trump’s voters important pay raises before the 2020 elections.

Business interests will rally to block Trump’s threat to shutter the border until Mexico helps stop the mass migration, which is being aided by new bus lines which ferry migrants up to the U.S. border.

Trump’s statement comes as border official are trying to warn Congress of the problems.

For example, DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said in a Thursday letter to all members of Congress that, “We face a system-wide meltdown … We are witnessing the real-time dissolution of the immigration system.”

She added, “I will be working with the Office of Management and Budget to provide you additional details in the near future, but the situation is so dire we want to make notification to you now that we will require additional resources … to ensure immediate safety and care of individuals in our custody.”

On Monday, border commissioner Kevin McAleenan provided reporters with some details about the Central Americans’ rush into Americans’ society, jobs, and schools. The March inflow alone will include roughly 15,000 parents and 40,000 children in “family units” who will ask for asylum — and then will be released — plus roughly 35,000 single adults who will try to evade border officers, he said.

McAleenan pinned the blame on Congress and the judges who have jointly cut legal holes in the border fences by allowing migrants to stream into U.S. cities, jobs, and schools if they merely ask for asylum, saying:

The increase in family units is a direct response to the vulnerabilities in our legal frameworks where migrants and smugglers know that they will be released and be allowed to stay in the U.S. indefinitely pending immigration proceedings that could be many years out. This is due to court orders that undermine the integrity of our immigration system. There is no questioning [about] why this is happening.

DHS Nielsen: "We are witnessing the real-time dissolution of the immigration system.” GOP: 'Yeah, but donors need more labor, consumers & renters.' Dems: 'Whatevs, we're getting 2032 voters.' Media; 'We're sharing feels with grateful migrants.' Voters: TBD https://t.co/aJuus1JFhj — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) March 29, 2019

Each year, roughly four million young Americans join the workforce after high school or university. The federal government then imports roughly 1.1 million legal immigrants, refreshes a resident population of roughly 1.5 million white-collar guest workers and roughly 500,000 blue-collar visa workers, and it also tolerates about eight million illegal workers.

In 2019 — because of catch-and-release rules mandated by Congress and the courts — the federal government also will likely release at least 350,000 migrant Central American laborers into the U.S. job market even as at least 500,000 more migrants sneak past U.S. border defenses or overstay their visas.

This federal policy of using legal and illegal migration to boost economic growth for investors shifts enormous wealth from young employees towards older investors by flooding the market with cheap white-collar graduates and blue-collar foreign labor.

This cheap labor economic policy forces Americans to compete even for low wage jobs, it widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids’ schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines millions of marginalized Americans, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.

But Trump’s “Hire American” policy has crimped the supply of new workers, so allowing blue-collar Americans to get a four percent wage increase in 2018.


President Donald Trump again threatened Friday to close the Southern border as soon as next week if Mexico did not do more to stop caravans of migrants from traveling to the United States.

“Mexico is tough. They can stop them. But they chose not to,” Trump said. “Now they got to stop them. If they don’t stop them, we’re closing the border. We’ll close it and we’ll keep it closed for a long time, I’m not playing games.”

The president pointed to two large caravans coming up to the Southern border through Mexico from Guatemala.

“They have to grab it and they have to stop it,” Trump referring to Mexico leaders.

He said that the United States immigration laws were “the weakest, the most pathetic laws” and demanded that Mexico to use their tougher laws to stop the caravans.

“There’s a very good likelihood that I’ll be closing the border next week and that will be just fine with me,” he said.

The president commented on the border crisis during a visit to a dike in Florida and an afternoon press conference at his club at Mar-a-Lago.

Trump acknowledged that although Mexico started to break up caravans, they had since stopped even trying.

“Mexico has to stop it. They have people coming right through Mexico. It’s a long, very dangerous journey, Mexico sends busses, they send trucks,” he said.

He also criticized countries like Honduras and Guatemala and El Salvador for “sending” their people towards the United States and said he stopped sending them money for aid.

“They set up these caravans, in many cases, they put their worst people in the caravans, they are not going to put their best in, they get rid of their problems and they march up here,” the president said.

Trump praised U.S. border officials for catching illegal immigrants at the border but acknowledged that border enforcement had “run out of space” to detain them all.

“We can’t hold people anymore and Mexico can stop it so easily, they don’t go through a court system every time somebody steps on our land, you step on our land, ‘Welcome to the United States’ it’s ridiculous,” Trump said.

Former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson on Friday weighed in on the situation at the southern border, saying the United States was “truly in a crisis.”

Johnson, who served in the Obama administration, said he was invested in the apprehension numbers as part of his job and explained how 4,000 apprehensions and encounters in one day were unimaginable.

“When I was in office in Kirstjen Nielsen’s job at her desk, I’d get to work around 6:30 in the morning and there’d be my intelligence book sitting on my desk, the PDB, and also the apprehension numbers from the day before,” Johnson revealed on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” “And I’d look at them every memory morning, it would be the first thing I’d look at, and I probably got too close to the problem.”

He continued, “[M]y staff will tell you if it was under 1,000 apprehensions the day before, that was a relatively good number. And if it was above 1,000, it was a relatively bad number, and I was going to be in a bad mood the whole day. On Tuesday, there were 4,000 apprehensions. I know that a thousand overwhelms the system. I cannot begin to imagine what 4,000 a day looks like. So we are truly in a crisis.”

The City of Chicago on Thursday warned Empire actor Jussie Smollett that he could be prosecuted for lying if he fails to repay the the six-figure cost of the Chicago Police Department’s investigation into his alleged hate hoax in the next seven days.

In a letter written by Edward Siskel, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s senior legal adviser, Smollett is accused of making “false statements,” which led law enforcement to divert “resources from other investigations and undermining the criminal justice system.”

Jussie Smollett reiterated Tuesday that he was innocent of staging a racist and homophobic attack against himself in downtown Chicago after the Cook County State’s Attorney’s surprise decision to drop 16 charges against the actor for filing a false police report on the incident. Speaking outside a Chicago courtroom, he maintained he had been “truthful and consistent on every single level since day one.”

Siskel’s letter, which was sent to the office of Smollet’s attorney, Patricia Brown Holmes, states that “Chicago police investigation revealed that [Smollett] knowingly filed a false police report and had in fact orchestrated your own attack.” Further, Smollett is requested to issue an “immediate payment of the $130,160.15 expended on overtime hours in the investigation of this matter,” to be made within one week.

The letter continues that if the actor doesn’t resolve the amount owed to the City of Chicago Corporate Counsel, he could be prosecuted by the Department of Law and slapped with a fine of up to $1,000, “plus up to three times the amount of damages the city sustains as a result of the violation.”

City officials say at least $150,000 was spent on the case.

On Tuesday, the Cook County State’s Attorney’s office announced it was dropping all charges against Smollett “after reviewing all of the facts and circumstances of the case, including Mr. Smollett’s volunteer service in the community and agreement to forfeit his bond to the City of Chicago, we believe this outcome is a just disposition and appropriate resolution to this case.”

Police charge Smollett, who is African-American and gay, paid two brothers — Abel and Ola Osundairo — to stage the January 29th attack in downtown Chicago in an attempt to boost his career. Smollett told detectives his assailants wore masks as they hurled insults, lopped a thin rope around his neck and doused him with an unknown liquid. He also said the attackers shouted “This is MAGA country,” a reference to President Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan, before fleeing the scene.

The BBC was ordered to pay damages after the far-left outlet published fake news claiming Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko “authorized” an illegal payment of $400,000 to Michael Cohen for additional face time during a June 2017 meeting with President Trump.

“We apologize to Mr. Poroshenko for any distress caused and have agreed to pay him damages, legal costs and have participated in a joint statement in open court,” the BBC’s said in a written apology published Thursday.

In the May 2018 piece, the disgraced BBC made the absurd claim that Poroshenko, who already had a meeting set up with Trump, paid this $400,000 to extend the meeting.

Think about how well this utterly deranged piece of fake news fits into the overall media’s Russia Collusion Hoax.

Poroshenko is an aggressive opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin, so naturally the only way he could get serious face time with Trump (aka Putin’s Stooge) is through a six-figure bribe. Michael Cohen was still the president’s personal lawyer at this time, which means the media were desperate for us to see Cohen as Trump’s world-traveling bagman, because that would lend credibility to the phony dossier’s lie about Cohen visiting Prague to pay off the hackers who got Hillary’s emails. The story openly insinuates Trump is both in Putin’s pocket and accepting bribes.

In a way you have to admire the slickness of it — the triple bank-shot of hysteria the BBC hoped to sink.

But it is also preposterous. Who in their right mind would believe a billionaire like Trump would risk his presidency (and prison) for a lousy $400,000, or use Cohen to arrange it?

Just as preposterous, though, is the whole idea Trump was a traitor who stole a presidential election, and we were hit with that media-lunacy 24/7 for two years.

More from the BBC:

In our News at Ten bulletin and in an online article published on May 23, 2018, we incorrectly reported that Petro Poroshenko, the President of Ukraine, had procured or authorised a corrupt payment of $400,000 to be made to Michael Cohen, the personal lawyer of Donald Trump, to extend a brief meeting between Mr. Poroshenko and President Trump, that had already been agreed, into more substantial talks.

No word yet on the amount of damages paid by the BBC, but it is good to see some justice done. The idea a news outlet can smear anyone they like, hide behind freedom of the press, and suffer no consequence is outrageous.

Let’s hope Nick Sandmann is delivered a similar form of justice very, very soon.

Poroshenko, who is running for re-election, sued the BBC over the report. Election Day is March 31.

In a recent article, TechCrunch reports that Facebook’s removal of Infowars host Alex Jones from its platform underscores the many issues the company has with content moderation.

In a recent article titled “Facebook’s handling of Alex Jones is a microcosm of its content policy problem,” TechCrunch reports that the removal of Infowars host Alex Jones from the Facebook platform is an example of the many issues that the site has with content moderation. Jones’ high profile persona meant that Facebook executives themselves had to get involved in the decision-making process.

TechCrunch writes:

To make that determination, 20 Facebook and Instagram executives hashed it out over the Jones post, which depicted a mural known as “False Profits” by the artist Mear One. Facebook began debating the post after it was flagged by Business Insider for kicking up anti semitic comments on Wednesday. The company removed 23 of 500 comments on the post that it interpreted to be in clear violation of Facebook policy. Later in the conversation, some of the UK-based Instagram and Facebook executives on the email provided more context for their US-based peers. Last year, a controversy over the same painting erupted when British politician Jeremy Corbyn argued in support of the mural’s creator after the art was removed from a wall in East London due what many believed to be antisemitic overtones. Because of that, the image and its context are likely better known in the UK, a fact that came up in Facebook’s discussion over how to handle the Jones post.

TechCrunch notes that the same image that had Jones removed from Facebook is still present across many of its platforms, posted by the artist behind the image. this demonstrates the company’s inconsistency in moderation:

Ultimately, after some back and forth, the post was removed. According to the emails, Alex Jones’ Instagram account “does not currently violate [the rules]” as “an IG account has to have at least 30% of content violating at any given time as per our regular guidelines.” That fact might prove puzzling once you know that Alex Jones got his main account booted off Facebook itself in 2018 — and the company did another sweep for Jones-linked pages last month. Whether you agree with Facebook’s content moderation decisions or not, it’s impossible to argue that they are consistently enforced. In the latest example, the company argued over a single depiction of a controversial image even as the same image is literally for sale by the artist elsewhere on both on Instagram and Facebook. (As any Facebook reporter can attest, these inconsistencies will probably be resolved shortly after this story goes live.)

TechCrunch notes that although Facebook appears to be trying to improve its content moderation, the sites inconsistent enforcement has led to further issues for the firm:

It’s clear that even as Facebook attempts to make strides, its approach to content moderation remains reactive, haphazard and probably too deeply preoccupied with public perception. Some cases of controversial content are escalated all the way to the top while others languish, undetected. Where the line is drawn isn’t particularly clear. And even when high profile violations are determined, it’s not apparent that those case studies meaningfully trickle down clarify smaller, everyday decisions by content moderators on Facebook’s lower rungs.

As always, the squeaky wheel gets the grease — but two billion users and reactive rather than proactive policy enforcement means that there’s an endless sea of ungreased wheels drifting around. This problem isn’t unique to Facebook, but given its scope, it does make the biggest case study in what can go wrong when a platform scales wildly with little regard for the consequences.

A Facebook spokesperson commented on the issue stating: “We want people to be able to express themselves freely on our platforms, but we also want to make sure that hate speech comes down. That is why we have public rules about what is and isn’t allowed on Facebook and Instagram. As this exchange shows, deciding what content stays up and who can use our platforms is one of the hardest decisions we have to make as a company and it’s sensible that we take the time to get it right.”

Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School’s pro-Second Amendment Kyle Kashuv has been accepted into Harvard.

He posted his acceptance to Instagram:

Kashuv emerged from the February 14, 2018, high school shooting a vocal proponent of the Second Amendment and an outspoken critic of the Broward County Sheriff’s Office. On March 25, 2018, he told Face the Nation that people pointing fingers regarding the shooting ought to point at the “cowards of Broward County” rather than guns.

Kashuv’s references to cowardice referenced a surveillance video that allegedly showed Broward County Deputy Scot Peterson arrive at the scene of the attack 90 seconds after it began, only to remain outside the building until the event was over and 17 people were dead.

On March 1, 2019, Breitbart News reported that Kashuv ended up on an elevator with Peterson and confronted him for not going in to stop the shooter.

The NRA cheered Kashuv’s acceptance to Harvard:

On December 22, 2018, Breitbart News reported that gun control proponent David Hogg was accepted to Harvard.

Hogg and Kashuv emerged from the Parkland shooting espousing two completely different worldviews. Hogg pushed various gun controls and student walk-outs/protests. Kashuv pushed for pro-Second Amendment ways schools could approach safety, and observed, “Walkouts don’t work. They are a waste of time and they’re counterproductive. They ruin the school system and they ruin the entire day for kids. Additionally, [a walkout] doesn’t solve anything; it doesn’t push policy.”

BOSTON (AP) — A procession of wealthy parents, from a Napa Valley vineyard owner to a Hot Pockets heiress, are appearing in court Friday to hear charges that they paid bribes to get their children into top colleges.

The 15 parents, including CEOs, investment executives, real estate developers and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, are slated to appear in Boston federal court on charges related to the nationwide college admissions cheating scheme dubbed Operation Varsity Blues.

Former casino executive Gamal Abdelaziz was the first to appear before Magistrate Judge Page Kelley.

Abdelaziz, the former president of Wynn Macau, who has also held leadership roles at Caesars Entertainment and MGM Resorts, didn’t make a statement in court, like most defendants. But his lawyer told the judge his client intends to fight the charges.

“This is not a strong case,” Brian Kelly said as he requested permission for Abdelaziz to travel to Mexico on business next month.

“This is a one-witness case” that relies on a “deeply compromised” witness, he said. “This is winnable.” Kelley granted the request on the condition Abdelaziz turn in his passport after the trip.

Abdelaziz is among 33 prominent parents charged in what authorities have called the biggest college admissions scam ever prosecuted . Authorities say the parents paid an admission consultant to rig their children’s test scores and bribe coaches at sought-after schools.

The most familiar names of the accused parents are actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin, but they’re not scheduled to appear in court until next week.

Among the others appearing Friday is 48-year-old Michelle Janavs, a former executive at her family’s food manufacturing company, Chef America, which made Hot Pockets before being bought out by Nestle for $2.6 billion in 2002.

She is accused of paying at least $100,000 to help her two daughters cheat on their college admissions exam and get into the University of Southern California as beach volleyball recruits.

William McGlashan, a 58-year-old former executive for the private equity firm TPG, is accused of paying bribes to get his son into USC as a recruit for the college’s storied football team, even though his son didn’t play football and his high school didn’t field a team.

And 53-year-old Austine Huneeus, whose family owns vineyards in California’s Napa Valley and in Oregon, is accused of paying at least $50,000 to have SAT administrators correct his daughter’s college entrance exam and to have USC officials designate her as a water polo recruit to improve her chances of getting into the college.

The initial court appearances are largely a formality.

Defendants weren’t asked to enter a plea Friday. Court officials simply recited the charges and maximum sentences while the judge informed the defendants of their rights and considered any special requests, such as Abdelaziz’s travel request.

The other defendants appearing Friday include prominent Miami developer Robert Zangrillo; Gregory Abbott, the founder and chairman of International Dispensing Corp. and his wife, Marcia Abbott; and Marci Palatella, who founded bourbon maker Preservation Distillery in Kentucky.

On Thursday, former Yale University women’s soccer coach Rudy Meredith became the third person to plead guilty in the case. Rick Singer, the admissions consultant at the center of the scheme, has also pleaded guilty.


Google has removed an app from the Google Play store which encouraged gay people to go through “conversion therapy,” following complaints from LGBT groups. Google still hasn’t removed an app which allows users to report “heresy” to Indonesia’s strict Muslim government, however, nor has the company removed a Saudi Arabian app which allows men to track women and limit their movement.

According to Business Insider, Google removed an app called “Living Hope Ministries” after it “encouraged LGBTQ people to seek conversion therapy.”

“The tech giant came under intense pressure to delete the app from the Google Play store, with a petition calling for its removal receiving more than 140,000 signatures,” Business Insider reported, adding that the company “consulted with outside advocacy groups before acting.”

In a statement, a spokesman for Google claimed that the company removed the app “after consulting with outside advocacy groups, reviewing our policies, and making sure we had a thorough understanding of the app and its relation to conversion therapy.”

As of writing, the petition to get the app removed has over 142,000 signatures, and the Human Rights Campaign congratulated Google for removing the app.

BREAKING: @Axios' @inafried reports Google has pulled down the dangerous so-called "conversion therapy app." We applaud @Google for making the right decision to pull this from their online store, an important step to protect LGBTQ youth.

Google has still yet to remove an Indonesian app which allows users to report “heresy” to the strict Muslim government, however, and has also not removed a Saudi Arabian app which allows men to track and limit women’s movements.

The Indonesian app, Smart Pakem, made news headlines last year, yet the app is still available on the Google Play store.

The Saudi Arabian app, Absher, was reported on in February, and is also still available, despite calls from Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) for Google to remove the app.

Last year, LGBT apps were pulled from the Google Play store in Indonesia amid persecution against LGBT people in the country.

Will & Grace actor Sean Hayes targeted Vice President Mike Pence for mockery at the GLAAD Media Awards Thursday.

“That’s like three proud decades of being Mike Pence’s worst nightmare,” Sean Hayes said of the 30th annual GLAAD event.

“Or wildest dream. We’ll never know,” he added.

Oh, Sean Hayes went there. 😬 pic.twitter.com/jo22U0SEXT — Marc Malkin (@marcmalkin) March 29, 2019

Actress Debra Messing, another Will & Grace alum, is very politically outspoken. Last year, she declared that members of the Trump administration were all going to burn in hell.

Hayes and Messing starred in a video encouraging voter turnout last October in the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections.

The GLAAD event Thursday was packed with star power, including Beyonce and Jay-Z. The couple received the group’s “Vanguard Award.”

The group says the award honors “allies who have made a significant difference in promoting acceptance of LGBTQ people.”

Jay-Z honored his mother, Gloria Carter, a lesbian whose story was featured last year in his song and video “Smile.”

Beyonce told the audience one of her most beautiful memories about respect was on her tour “looking out from the stage every night and seeing the hardest gangsta trappin’ right next to the most fabulous queen.”

The “Tom Ford” rapper received the award despite having a long history of using homophobic slurs in his music.

Tyler R. Barriss, 26, was sentenced to 20 years in prison after pleading guilty to 51 federal charges — some of which led to the 2017 death of 28-year-old Andrew Finch.

Barriss has admitted to contacting the Wichita police from Los Angeles on Dec. 28, 2017 — with the explicit intent of falsely reporting a shooting and kidnapping at a Wichita residence. The Associated Press reports, “Authorities say an Ohio gamer recruited Barriss to ‘swat’ a Wichita gamer, but that the address they used was old, leading police to Finch, who was not involved in the video game or the dispute.”

When Finch answered the door, he was shot to death by a member of law enforcement.

Shane Gaskill and Casey Viner have been charged as co-conspirators. According to the Associated Press, “authorities say Viner provided Barriss with an address for Gaskill that Gaskill had previously given to Viner. Authorities also say that when Gaskill noticed Barriss was following him on Twitter, he gave Barriss that old address and taunted him to ‘try something.'”

All three allegedly conspired to call in bomb and shooting reports to a high school and convention center in Connecticut, as well as locations in Texas, Indiana, Ohio, Missouri, and Illinois. Both Gaskill and Viner have pled not guilty to crimes including conspiracy to obstruct justice and wire fraud, but Viner has signaled his intention to change his plea at a hearing scheduled for April 3.

Finch’s family has filed a lawsuit against both the city of Wichita and the police officer involved. Prosecutors, however, have declined to charge the unidentified law enforcement agent.

White members of the press were barred from entering the Bolton Street Baptist Church for a community event highlighting black mayoral candidates in Savannah, Georgia.

The sign on the church door was anything but subtle: “No media (T.V. Radio, etc.) Black Press Only!” All white reporters were prevented from entering the premises, while black reporters from two television stations, as well as the publisher of the Savannah Tribune newspaper, were permitted.

The Trigon consultant group was in charge of promoting the event, described as being “about supporting ONE candidate from the African American Community for Mayor 2019!” Both potential candidates in attendance are running in an attempt to beat incumbent Mayor Eddie Deloach — the first white mayor of Savannah in 20 years when he was elected.

Stephen Moody, a reporter with WJCL who attended the event, said that no recording of any kind was allowed. Savannah Alderman Van Johnson spoke at the meeting but did not address the access restrictions. “It’s not my meeting,” Johnson said. “I was asked to come and give a statement, so I came and I gave a statement. What I said in there, I’ll say out here.”

Louis Wilson — one of the candidates defeated by Deloach — is making another run at the office. He also declined to comment on the event’s policy. “I didn’t plan the meeting so I can’t comment on that part,” he said. “I came to say what I had to say.”

A suspected Sinaloa Cartel operative was arrested south of the California border this week by the State Preventive Police (PEP) of Baja California after they discovered three firearms and two pounds of methamphetamine during a traffic stop in Mexicali.

Elements of the PEP patrolling in Mexicali came upon a red 2001 Jeep Cherokee. Their attention was drawn to this vehicle since they previously received intelligence pertaining to the driver. The state police later identified the man as Raúl “N,” 23. Officers discovered three firearms, four magazines, numerous rounds of various caliber, a ballistic vest, and a kilogram of methamphetamine, according to local media reports.

The driver was subsequently arrested for illegal possession of firearms and drug charges. The man is suspected of being an operative for the Sinaloa Cartel in the Mexicali Valley region, according to local Breitbart law enforcement sources. The valley is a key region for drug and human smuggling activities into Imperial Valley, California, with easy access to Los Angeles and Phoenix.

Mexican authorities and U.S. counterparts continue to make large seizures of methamphetamine along the California and Arizona borders. According to Breitbart law enforcement sources, most seizures are the result of the Sinaloa Cartel’s escalated production with “super labs.”

Breitbart News recently reported on a major seizure in the region by elements of the Mexican Federal Police, who seized approximately one ton of meth, heroin, and fentanyl. Police were conducting security operations along the Mexico-California border at the time.

Robert Arce is a retired Phoenix Police detective with extensive experience working Mexican organized crime and street gangs. Arce has worked in the Balkans, Iraq, Haiti, and recently completed a three-year assignment in Monterrey, Mexico, working out of the Consulate for the United States Department of State, International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Program, where he was the Regional Program Manager for Northeast Mexico (Coahuila, Tamaulipas, Nuevo Leon, Durango, San Luis Potosi, Zacatecas.)

A year-long DEA Task Force investigation culminated this week in Charlotte, North Carolina, resulting in the takedown of a major Mexican cartel-linked operation and the arrests of more than a dozen engaged in the sale of heroin, meth, and cocaine.

A total of 18 arrests were made in addition to the seizure of 40 pounds of heroin, 20 pounds of methamphetamine, and 15.4 pounds of cocaine, according to the DEA. Also recovered was a handgun and $8,000 cash, according to local reports. Many of those arrested were determined to be in the country illegally.

A year-long DEA Task Force investigation has resulted in 18 arrests, most in Charlotte and the seizure of 40 lbs of heroin, 20 pounds of meth, and more than 15 lbs of cocaine. The drugs have a street value of $3.5 million. pic.twitter.com/LNoMuWAraR — CMPD News (@CMPD) March 28, 2019

The investigation revealed the operation had links to Cártel Jalisco Nueva Generación (CJNG).

“This cartel is one of the most deadly cartels in America, operating in America,” said DEA acting assistant special agent in charge Dustin Harmon. Authorities indicated that the drugs seized were to be sold across the Charlotte region.

“Those are the drugs causing overdose deaths, a lot of pain and suffering and misery in the community and we want to do everything we can to stop that,” said Mecklenburg County Assistant DA Jeff Davis. The DEA said that there have been overdoses in the region linked to the busted group. The investigation also resulted in arrests in California.

The SBI assisted the DEA on a case involving 18 arrests where 40 lbs. of heroin, 20 lbs. of meth. & 7 kg of cocaine were recovered. That’s a $3.5 million street value. DEA Acting ASAC Harmon & SBI SAC Bridges talked with @wsoctv @AllisonWSOC9 about the impact on #Clt. pic.twitter.com/Wt9crUSrjf — NC SBI (@SBI1937) March 28, 2019

The drugs were transported to the Charlotte area in vehicles equipped with hidden compartments and by air. Breitbart News reported earlier this week about a Mexican cartel-linked drug operation busted in Minneapolis, Minnesota, after a raid on a luxury high-rise residence. It was later determined the drugs were transported and delivered in two suitcases by air travel.

The CJNG is blamed for much of the recent record-breaking killings in Mexico as they quickly move to claim new territories.

A member of the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas gang pleaded guilty to human smuggling charges for his role in trying to sneak two migrants past a U.S. Border Patrol checkpoint.

This week, 33-year-old Cody Michael Matousek, an alleged member of the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas in Galveston, entered a guilty plea in federal court on the charge of human smuggling and human smuggling conspiracy. He remains in federal custody pending sentencing. Matousek’s co-conspirator, 38-year-old Guadalupe Levario, also pleaded guilty to the charge but was allowed to remain free on bond.

According to information provided to Breitbart News by the U.S Attorney’s Office, the charges against the two men stem from a February 8 human smuggling attempt where they tried to use a wrecker service to move a pickup truck past a U.S. Border Patrol checkpoint. Inside the towed vehicle hid two migrants from Brazil.

Matousek originally picked up the two migrants a day prior in Mission, Texas, and moved them to a stash house. From there, Matousek and Levario organized for an apparently uninvolved wrecker service to transport the “broken down” vehicle through a checkpoint. The tow driver assented to a search of the vehicle, revealing the hidden Brazilians. The illegal immigrants then advised authorities about their smugglers waiting at a rendezvous point in Kingsville.

Prosecutors said Matousek was the subject in other investigations involving a human smuggling cell run by the Aryan Brotherhood. Authorities singled out Matousek as one of the main organizers.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) has entered week two of her crybaby meltdown over disastrous poll numbers and now she’s blaming Fox News and Breitbart News for her unpopularity.

Quinnipiac is one of the most unreliable left-wing pollsters out there (not named Marist or CNN), so when the Q-poll has bad news for America’s Socialist “It Girl,” it is worth taking notice.

Quinnipiac found Ocasio-Crazy’s national favorability rating sits at a pathetic 23 percent; her unfavorable is 36 percent, which means she is upside down by double digits — 13 whole points.

But here is sweetest part of the song … only 47 percent of Democrats — Democrats, y’all — view Ocasio-Crazy favorably. Seven percent view her unfavorably and 44 percent have no idea who she is.

Among Independents, the self-proclaimed socialist (who grew up in Westchester — LOL) is upside-down 16 points — 20 to 36 percent.

Ocasio-CowFart is even upside down with women, 27 to 30 percent.

Faced with this news, the freshman congresswoman went the full-black helicopter. After posting a link to her terrible, awful, very bad polling news, she tweeted, “It’s almost as though there is a directed + concerted far-right propaganda machine with a whole cable news channel, and a dark-money internet operation propped up by the Mercers et al dedicated to maligning me & stoking nat’l division[.]”

It’s almost as though there is a directed + concerted far-right propaganda machine with a whole cable news channel, and a dark-money internet operation propped up by the Mercers et al dedicated to maligning me & stoking nat’l division, reported on by @JaneMayerNYer or something https://t.co/HChBp04c8W — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) March 29, 2019

What’s driving Ocasio-Crazy crazy is that this is the fourth poll this year that proves just how wildly unpopular she and her terrible ideas are.

Gallup has her upside down by ten points, 31 percent favorable to 41 percent unfavorable.

Earlier this month, a Siena College poll found that President Donald Trump is more popular in the bluer than blue state of New York than she is. Only 31 percent of New Yorkers view the Pixie Demagogue favorably, compared to 36 percent for Trump.

The Morning Consult poll has her upside down by 4 points; 24 to 28 percent.

A Fox poll has her upside down by 13 points; 26 to 39 percent.

Sorry, cupcake, nobody likes you.

And why would we?

You want to slaughter all our cows, confiscate that which makes Americans Americans (guns, cars, and meat), and you gesticulate like a drunken Beto O’Rourke explaining why he didn’t leave the scene of an accident…

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4ZX0wm45SA

You’re a bossy busybody who wants to central plan all of our lives, who hides her desire to rule over us behind chirpy blah-blah-blah about saving us.

But that doesn’t mean she’s entirely wrong…

Let me put it this way — I hope she’s right about Fox News and Breitbart News being responsible for these humiliating poll numbers, because what that means for the country makes me giddy.

Think about it…

Ocasio-Crazy is the perfect test case in the ongoing war between the fake and illegitimate establishment media and the conservative media.

To begin with, she’s new on the scene and therefore undefined.

Secondly, the establishment media immediately made a project of her; conspired to make her The Next Big Thing, a National Leader, an Influencer and Opinion Leader.

The process through which the media anoint the anointed, the farm team through which the media create The Leaders of Tomorrow, fell at her feet through countless fawning media profiles, high-profile interviews filled with softball questions — all that jazz.

What’s more, Ocasio-Crazy is young and appealing and charismatic. But…

The media’s campaign failed this time, failed to define her voice and ideas as The Future, and it failed because Conservative Media saw her for what she is (a phony, power-mad, not terribly bright fanatic) and we are now able to get the word out, to compete with the corporate media in the news cycle.

And we won, the truth won… And more importantly, the establishment media lost.

More proof the media no longer hold the power to manipulate public opinion?

I think so.

And the fake news lost the Ocasio-Crazy battle before the Mueller Report, before the bottom fell out of the media’s credibility among millions and millions of Democrats who are just now waking up to the fact they were hustled for two years with an absurd lie and conspiracy theory.

The media landscape is shifting — not dramatically, but noticeably, and this is a wonderful thing.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) has entered week two of her crybaby meltdown over disastrous poll numbers and now she’s blaming Fox News and Breitbart News for her unpopularity.

Quinnipiac is one of the most unreliable left-wing pollsters out there (not named Marist or CNN), so when the Q-poll has bad news for America’s Socialist “It Girl,” it is worth taking notice.

Quinnipiac found Ocasio-Crazy’s national favorability rating sits at a pathetic 23 percent; her unfavorable is 36 percent, which means she is upside down by double digits — 13 whole points.

But here is sweetest part of the song … only 47 percent of Democrats — Democrats, y’all — view Ocasio-Crazy favorably. Seven percent view her unfavorably and 44 percent have no idea who she is.

Among Independents, the self-proclaimed socialist (who grew up in Westchester — LOL) is upside-down 16 points — 20 to 36 percent.

Ocasio-CowFart is even upside down with women, 27 to 30 percent.

Faced with this news, the freshman congresswoman went the full-black helicopter. After posting a link to her terrible, awful, very bad polling news, she tweeted, “It’s almost as though there is a directed + concerted far-right propaganda machine with a whole cable news channel, and a dark-money internet operation propped up by the Mercers et al dedicated to maligning me & stoking nat’l division[.]”

What’s driving Ocasio-Crazy crazy is that this is the fourth poll this year that proves just how wildly unpopular she and her terrible ideas are.

Gallup has her upside down by ten points, 31 percent favorable to 41 percent unfavorable.

Earlier this month, a Siena College poll found that President Donald Trump is more popular in the bluer than blue state of New York than she is. Only 31 percent of New Yorkers view the Pixie Demagogue favorably, compared to 36 percent for Trump.

The Morning Consult poll has her upside down by 4 points; 24 to 28 percent.

A Fox poll has her upside down by 13 points; 26 to 39 percent.

Sorry, cupcake, nobody likes you.

And why would we?

You want to slaughter all our cows, confiscate that which makes Americans Americans (guns, cars, and meat), and you gesticulate like a drunken Beto O’Rourke explaining why he didn’t leave the scene of an accident…

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4ZX0wm45SA

You’re a bossy busybody who wants to central plan all of our lives, who hides her desire to rule over us behind chirpy blah-blah-blah about saving us.

But that doesn’t mean she’s entirely wrong…

Let me put it this way — I hope she’s right about Fox News and Breitbart News being responsible for these humiliating poll numbers, because what that means for the country makes me giddy.

Think about it…

Ocasio-Crazy is the perfect test case in the ongoing war between the fake and illegitimate establishment media and the conservative media.

To begin with, she’s new on the scene and therefore undefined.

Secondly, the establishment media immediately made a project of her; conspired to make her The Next Big Thing, a National Leader, an Influencer and Opinion Leader.

The process through which the media anoint the anointed, the farm team through which the media create The Leaders of Tomorrow, fell at her feet through countless fawning media profiles, high-profile interviews filled with softball questions — all that jazz.

What’s more, Ocasio-Crazy is young and appealing and charismatic. But…

The media’s campaign failed this time, failed to define her voice and ideas as The Future, and it failed because Conservative Media saw her for what she is (a phony, power-mad, not terribly bright fanatic) and we are now able to get the word out, to compete with the corporate media in the news cycle.

And we won, the truth won… And more importantly, the establishment media lost.

More proof the media no longer hold the power to manipulate public opinion?

I think so.

Small Business Administration head Linda McMahon is expected to announce her resignation from President Donald Trump’s Cabinet as early as Friday, according to Politico.

Politico’s Alex Isenstadt and Eliana Johnson report McMahon is expected to join a pro-Trump super PAC in a “senior capacity as the president ramps up his 2020 re-election efforts.

NEWS w/ @elianayjohnson: Linda McMahon to join pro-Trump super PAC in senior capacity, per 3 sources…story tk… — Alex Isenstadt (@politicoalex) March 29, 2019

The development comes as McMahon is scheduled to attend a fundraiser with President Trump at Mar-a-Lago in south Flordia this weekend.

Politico reports:

McMahon, who has known Trump for years, has kept a relatively low profile at SBA. Unlike other Trump administration Cabinet officials, she has not been dogged by scandal. Inside the White House, she’s seen as a loyal foot soldier. She regularly travels around the country to promote the president’s agenda, including recent trips to promote the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal.

While it is unclear who will replace McMahon, Pradeep Belur, the SBA’s chief of staff, has been floated as a possible contender.

McMahon previously served as the CEO at WWE before leaving the wrestling giant in 2009 to run for the U.S. Senate in Connecticut. She lost two bids for Senate in 2010 and 2012 against her Democrat rivals Sens. Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy, who endorsed her nomination to the SBA. The Senate voted to confirm McMahon 81-19.

At the time of her confirmation, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said McMahon will “prioritize growing jobs over growing government bureaucracy.”

“In so many states, including mine, that’s a welcome change from Washington,” he added.

Throughout her tenure as SBA chief, President Trump has repeated praised McMahon’s business acumen, describing her as “one of the country’s top female executives.”

Several Democrat members of Congress have replaced their POW/MIA flags with transgender pride flags outside their congressional offices on Capitol Hill.

A group of Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have eliminated their military flags in exchange for the pink, blue, and white transgender pride flag to protest the military ban on trans soldiers, Fox News reported.

The stunt apparently came at the request of the “National Center for Transgender Equality,” Fox News reported. The group released a statement claiming to have sent the flag to members of Congress with a letter asking them to be displayed to protest President Trump’s plan to exclude trans individuals from serving in the military:

Members of the Senate also joined the effort, one being Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

“Discrimination has no place in our society. I am proud to display this flag as a symbol of my support for transgender people across the country. We must stand with transgender people in all of our communities,” Sanders tweeted this week:

Other Democrats who placed the flag outside their office include Massachusetts Rep. Joe Kennedy, Washington Reps. Adam Smith and Kim Schrier, Ohio’s Tim Ryan, and Virginia Rep. Jennifer Wexton, among others.

President Trump’s ban on transgender members in the military remains mired in the courts, but the U.S. Supreme Court recently allowed the ban to continue despite a lower court’s ruling to put a halt on the ban as lawsuits against the policy wind their way through the system.

This story has been updated to specify the flags are for transgender pride.

Friday on Fox News Channel’s “Fox & Friends,” 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Gov. Jay Inslee (D-WA) Friday called President Donald Trump “cowardly” on climate change.

When asked about the cost of the so-called Green News Deal, Inslee said, “What is is expensive is losing jobs to the Chinese and the Germans. Look we want these jobs in our country. We want to build wind turbines in our country in Iowa we want to build batteries for electric cars in Nevada. We want to build electric cars like we are doing today. Look they are putting on 400 new jobs in Michigan the same week Donald Trump is so cowardly and pessimistic.”

He continued, “This is a can-do nation. We put a man on the moon; we defeated Fascism. We can use our smarts to build a clean energy economy like we are doing right today. We need an inspirational leader, not a pessimistic one in the White House. I think I am ready for that job. This country is ready for a spark of optimism.”

He added, “When your town is burning down the people of Paradise, CA are talking about climate change. They deserve a president who will protect them, rather than the oil industries. I’m tired of putting out billions of dollars to the fossil fuel industry and lobbyists, and he is put in charge of this nation. He wanted to drain the swamp. He put the swamp in charge of our tax policies. It is just wrong.”

Microsoft founder Bill Gates celebrated proposed legislation which would advance the development of nuclear energy technology, Thursday.

Gates, a notable backer of nuclear energy, responded to proposed legislation “which establishes an ambitious plan to accelerate the development of advanced nuclear reactor technologies,” Thursday.

“Yesterday, a bipartisan group of leaders in the U.S. Senate introduced the Nuclear Energy Leadership Act, which establishes an ambitious plan to accelerate the development of advanced nuclear reactor technologies. I can’t overstate how important this is,” Gates declared. “To prevent the worst effects of climate change, we need to reach near-zero emissions on all the things that drive it—agriculture, electricity, manufacturing, transportation, and buildings—by investing in innovation across all sectors while deploying low cost renewables.”

“Nuclear energy is one of these critical technologies. It’s ideal for dealing with climate change, because it is the only carbon-free, scalable energy source that’s available 24 hours a day,” he continued. “I’m thrilled that senators from both sides of the aisle have come together to support advanced nuclear. This is exactly the kind of leadership our country needs to both solve the climate challenge and reassert our leadership in this important industry.”

The legislation, titled the Nuclear Energy Leadership Act, would “direct the Secretary of Energy to establish advanced nuclear goals, provide for a versatile, reactor-based fast neutron source, make available high assay, low-enriched uranium for research, development, and demonstration of advanced nuclear reactor concepts, and for other purposes.”

It was introduced by Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), Sen. James Risch (R-ID), Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV), Sen. Mike Crapo (R-ID), Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN), Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Sen. Cory Gardner (R-CO), Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE), Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-SC), Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO), Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), and Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH).

“The Nuclear Energy Leadership Act (NELA), aims to reestablish U.S. leadership in nuclear energy,” claimed a press release. “It will bring together private and public sector innovators to develop next-generation advanced reactor concepts.”

As reported by GeekWire, “Back in December, Gates listed nuclear energy research as one of his top policy priorities, and he reportedly followed up by promising lawmakers he’d invest $1 billion of his own money and line up another $1 billion in private capital if federal funds were approved for a TerraPower pilot project in the United States.”

A report published in the Journal of Industrial Ecology claims that white people’s eating habits are contributing more to climate change than their black and Latino counterparts.

Report authors concluded, using data on food production — use of water, land, production, and distribution — that white people’s diet causes more greenhouse gas emissions.

“Potatoes, beef, apples, and milk are some of the worst offenders,” the New York Post reported.

“The food pipeline — which includes its production, distribution, and waste — contributes significantly to climate change through the production of greenhouse gases and requires significant amounts of water and land, which also has environmental effects,” Joe Bozeman, a student at the University of Illinois who helped produce the report, said.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) contributed to the report, providing data on more than 500 food groups and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) weighed in on individual diets.

The Post reported:

Data showed that whites produced an average of 680 kilograms of the CO2 each year, attributable to food and drink, whereas Latinx individuals produced 640 kilograms, and blacks 600. They also found the diets of white people required 328,000 liters of water on average per year. Latinx used just 307,000 liters, and blacks 311,800. Both black and Latinx individuals used more land per capita with 1,770 and 1,710 square meters per year, respectively than white people with just 1,550. Nevertheless, white people still made the greatest overall contribution to climate change.

The underlying purpose of the study is ominous, calling for policies to address the findings.

“The study was undertaken to get a better understanding of the environmental impacts of the food consumption patterns of major demographic groups so that environmental policies designed to reduce negative impacts of food production could be drafted that take these differences into account,” a press release announcing the report said.

“If you are going to draft policies that may reduce the amount of land-intensive oranges, we need to think about other less resource-intensive sources of vitamin C,” Bozeman said. “It gets more complex as you look closely at the food pipeline and how different populations engage with it, but we are now starting to get a better understanding on these complex dynamics in such a way that we can begin to rationally take steps to improve environmental quality.”

The report Abstract stated, in part:

Our findings suggest that obtaining data with the intention of building consensus across sociodemographic lines overcomes barriers in the understanding phase, leading to increased social receptivity for many planning and managing phase processes. Specifically, we find that identifying and developing leaders who possess the cognitive and interpersonal capacity to manage many variables and stakeholders is key to assessing and selecting adaptation options in the planning phase. We also propose using government programming to encourage environmentally friendly food purchasing behavior. Then, we discuss how our proposals could be used in adaptation feasibility and evaluation activities in the managing phase. In all, these findings facilitate the development of improved climate change adaptation and policy by satisfying the understanding phase of the climate change adaptation framework, establishing a cross‐disciplinary methodological approach to addressing socioecological problems, and providing useful FEW impact data for FEW nexus and climate change researchers.

“While the difference may not be enormous, these numbers are per individual, and when you add up all those individuals, it’s very clear that whites are responsible for the majority of greenhouse gases emitted as a result of their food choices,” Bozeman said.

Halloween star Jamie Lee Curtis took out after former Vice President Joe Biden for his recent comments about Anita Hill, demanding the possible 2020 White House hopeful to just apologize to Hill.

The True Lies actress slammed Biden in a mostly all caps tweet, Thursday, demanding that Biden drop all the jaw-jaw and just apologize to Anita Hill for his part in the 1991 confirmation hearings to place Clarence Thomas on the U.S. Supreme Court where Hill came forward to claim Thomas sexually harassed her.

“Come on @JoeBiden,” Curtis tweeted. “Just CALL Anita Hill and then GO TO HER HOUSE and APOLOGIZE to her FACE. The longer you wait, the worse it gets.”

Come on @JoeBiden . Just CALL Anita Hill and then GO TO HER HOUSE and APOLOGIZE to her FACE. The longer you wait the worse it gets. — Jamie Lee Curtis (@jamieleecurtis) March 27, 2019

Curtis’ comments came on the heels of Biden’s appearance before an event in New York for his Joe Biden Foundation where he claimed that he has “always regretted” not being able to do more to help Anita Hill during the 1991 hearings.

During his address Biden said he sure wishes he could have done more to help “national hero” Anita Hill back when she was testifying before a Senate committee about claims of sexual harassment perpetrated against her by now Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.

“A brave lawyer, a really notable woman, Anita Hill, a professor, showed the courage of a lifetime talking about her experience being harassed by Clarence Thomas,” Biden said in New York on Wednesday. “But she paid a terrible price. She was abused in the hearing. She was taken advantage of. Her reputation was attacked. I wish I could have done something.”

Despite Biden’s proclamations that he did all he could to help Hill, many voices in the liberal press quickly pointed out that Joe could have done much more and that he has never apologized to Hill in person for his actions.

Former Vice President Joe Biden leads Sen. Bernie Sanders by 19 points in a 2020 primary poll of Pennsylvania.

Biden is leading with 39 percent support in Pennsylvania, while Sanders only has 20 percent, according to a poll conducted by Emerson College.

Sanders has a healthy 15 point lead above Biden from voters 18-29 years old but Biden leads with 40 percent support among 30-49 years olds, 38 percent among 50-64 years olds, and 55 percent among those 65 years or older.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren is in third place with eleven percent and Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg is in fourth place with 6 percent.

Former Congressman Beto O’Rourke and Sen. Kamala Harris tie for fifth place followed by Sen. Cory Booker, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, and Andrew Yang.

The poll shows that both Biden and Sanders are currently leading Trump in Pennsylvania by five points, but still within the margin of error.

The poll was conducted March 26-28 among 808 registered voters of 565 contacted by landlines and 242 responding to an online panel with a +/- 3.4 percent margin of error.

A partial transcript is as follows:

SCARBOROUGH: First of all, let’s talk about Nancy Pelosi. She’s been pitch perfect —

BRZEZINSKI: —So elegant.

Republican Rep. Lance Gooden of Texas asked for unanimous consent Wednesday for the House to consider a vote on the Born-Alive legislation that would protect babies who survive abortion.

Today, I asked the House to consider a bill from @RepAnnWagner to protect the lives of newborn infants who survive late-term abortions. Why in the world would House Democrats be opposed to preventing infanticide and giving these babies the medical care they deserve? pic.twitter.com/PpfTaIfAKT — Lance Gooden (@RepLanceGooden) March 27, 2019

For the 22nd time, House Democrats rejected a vote on H.R. 962, a bill that would require an infant who is born alive following an attempted abortion to receive the same form of prompt transfer to a hospital and medical attention any other child would be given.

House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, a Republican from Louisiana, and Republican Rep. Ann Wagner of Missouri introduced the bill on February 6 and Scalia intends to file a discharge petition that may be signed by other House members when it becomes active on April 2 if no action is taken by Democrat leaders. When a majority of members sign onto the discharge petition, it will force a vote on the Born-Alive legislation.

🚨🚨 BREAKING → I’ll be filing a discharge petition on @RepAnnWagner's Born Alive bill on April 2nd. This petition will bypass Nancy Pelosi & force a vote on the floor to #EndInfanticide if a majority of members sign on. Tell your representative to sign this petition! #LetUsVote — Steve Scalise (@SteveScalise) March 26, 2019

“This is the 24th time in total that Congressional Democrats thwarted an attempt by Republicans to vote on a bill that would provide medical care and treatment for babies who provide survived failed abortions — 22 times in the House and twice in the Senate,” observed pro-life media LifeNews.

Family Research Council President Tony Perkins said in a statement that “providing health care to babies born alive is an issue that should receive unanimous support, regardless of your position on abortion.”

“By continuing to block this commonsense legislation, Democratic leadership in the House is essentially giving the green light to infanticide,” he added. “There is no practice more barbaric than killing babies that could survive if given care.”

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy tweeted on March 25:

In February Senate Democrats voted against the Born-Alive legislation introduced in that chamber by Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Sasse. The bill failed as a result since it required a 60-vote supermajority for approval and Republicans could only obtain 53 votes for it.

“The silence from Congressional Democrats is deafening and shameful,” Scalise said upon the introduction of the legislation. “Every Member of Congress, regardless of party, needs to go on record against infanticide, and we must immediately take action to stop it. The American people deserve to know where their representatives stand on this critical issue.”

Perkins said America is at “a moment of decision.”

“Whether or not we will allow infanticide – the murder of a baby who survives the first attempt on their life – has become a defining issue for us as a nation,” he said.

Britain’s House of Commons has voted to reject Theresa May’s so-called Withdrawal Agreement just hours before the nation was supposed to leave the European Union, with or without a deal — a deadline betrayed this week by Parliament after they voted to postpone Brexit months or even years into the future.

Britain’s lawmakers have already voted against the settlement the Prime Minister agreed with the European Union twice, and the government was blocked from bringing it to Parliament again. Yet by splitting the deal into two pieces, the ‘Brexit in name only‘ apparently comes before Parliament again as a different vote in spirit only.

UPDATE 1830 — Nigel speaks to the rally

Nigel Farage has struck an optimistic note on this day of Brexit betrayal, telling the Parliament square rally:

I can’t think of any time in history, where a greater betrayal of a democratic vote has ever happened in the Western world, and they can tonight over there content themselves because they think they’re winning. But that’s because they live in the Westminster bubble. We’re the real people of this country, and we know that the referendum was the first of many great victories. We will get our country back, we will get out independence back, we will get out pride and self-respect back. We are going to win!

UPDATE 1710 — May meets cabinet members

The Prime Minister is reportedly meeting with a delegation of Cabinet ministers, who are thought to be urging her to adopt an even weaker form of Brexit than the one outlined in the seemingly abandoned Political Declaration which formerly accompanied the thrice-defeated Withdrawal Agreement, possibly involving full membership of the EU Customs Union, or “a” customs union which would have the same practical effect.

This would almost certainly kill any chance of the United Kingdom being able to strike new trade deals with countries like the United States, Australia, and New Zealand after Brexit, and leave the EU able to barter access to British markets without Britain’s political representatives having any say in the matter while striking its own trade deals.

Meanwhile, Nigel Farage is enjoying the crowds in Parliament Square…

UPDATE 1705 — EU’s Brexit Negotiator Floats Upgrading May’s ‘Worst Deal Ever’ to ‘Worst Deal Ever Plus Customs Union’

In comments reported by politico.eu, Michel Barnier suggested that the EU he was open to a deal which would mean the UK would maintain the same tariffs and trade policies as the EU, appealing to Remainer parliamentarians who want to stop a clean break.

“We are ready to be even more ambitious should the U.K.’s red-lines evolve. For instance, we are open to work on the principle of a permanent customs union should the U.K. decide to take this path,” Mr Barnier said at the College of Europe campus in Warsaw, Poland.

However, Barnier added, “Let me be frank: Without a positive choice, the default option would be a no-deal, which has become more likely. It was never our scenario, but the EU27 is now prepared.”

UPDATE 1650 — Tory Brexiteer cautions against optimism

Veteran Tory MP Michael Fabricant has warned that, “If #Brexiteers think that a victory has been won, because #Remainers and #Labour voted down the #Deal, think again.”

Mr Fabricant, a Brexiteer himself, who backed the deal with some reluctance, predicted that “On Monday, the #Remainer Parliament will try to keep us in the Customs Union which means our obeying #EU legislation and having no say in making them. Worse than [before]”.

However, the deal would have involved also have involved a “transition period” lasting to the end of December 2022 in which Britain would have essentially remained a full member of the European Union, minus its representation in the EU institutions — with Remainers able to push for a switch back to formal membership at the end of it if the despised backstop remained the only deal on offer.

UPDATE 1625 — Europe mouthpiece Ireland talks up long Brexit delay

Irish taoiseach (prime minister) Leo Varadkar is set for to meet with Germany’s Angela Merkel and France’s Emmanuel Macron for crunch talks in the wake of the Withdrawal Agreement’s rejection.

“These two meetings reflect the deep and warm relations Ireland enjoys with both France and Germany, including the support shown to Ireland during the Brexit negotiations,” said a spokesman for the Irish leader, who has been extremely combative throughout the EU’s talks with the British, despite his country’s heavy economic dependence on trade both with and via the United Kingdom, and the enormous blow which would fall on it in the event of No Deal.

“The [Irish] Government notes the decision of the House of Commons to reject the indicative Withdrawal Agreement. It is now up to the UK to indicate how it plans to proceed in order to avoid a No Deal scenario,” the taoiseach remarked in a separate statement on the British vote.

“We must be open to a long extension, should the United Kingdom decide to fundamentally reconsider its approach to Brexit,” he added.

UPDATE 1610 — In other news…

The Independent Group have chosen today to rebrand themselves as a political party in time, they hope, to challenge the potential European Parliament elections in May.

To the amusement of some on social media, they have chosen to call themselves the Change UK party — odd, given they are campaigning to keep things the same. Read more on Breitbart London:

UPDATE 1605 — Sir Bernard Jenkin: There are only 160 MPs who really believe in leaving the European Union

Saying that the most likely outcome of today’s developments was a longer extension, Sir Bernard said, “This only arises because there are about 160 MPs in parliament who really believe in leaving the European Union and the withdrawal agreement we ended up with was negotiated in such a way as to keep us poised to rejoin at some stage.

On Prime Minister Theresa May’s successor, the Tory Brexiteer said, “I think it’s important to have somebody that has the confidence of the whole party and we don’t have another kind of coronation like we had last time.

“I think the membership of the party must have the final choice and that makes its very likely we end up with someone who supports leave the European Union.

“We can’t have another prime minister who says she wants to leave the European Union and respects the result when they don’t believe in that project… putting someone in charge of a project they don’t believe in doesn’t work as we’ve learnt.”

Sir Bernard echoes the sentiments of former Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith who said told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme this morning, “We want the second phase [of Brexit negotiations] to be led by someone who passionately believes in what 17.4 million people voted for, which was to leave the European Union.”

“Now is the time for a new set of hands with a proper professional team that actually believes in Brexit and gets us through the next phase,” Mr Duncan Smith added.

UPDATE 1556 — Pro-Brexit demonstrators gathering outside Parliament

Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage has welcomed the defeat of Mrs May’s deal, but warned that it appears there are now fresh battles ahead for Brexiteers.

“The new EU treaty has been rightly defeated for a third time. Extension and further battles now seem inevitable,” he observed, vowing: “We are not downhearted, and will fight them again”

UPDATE 1542 — Diehard Brexiteer gives his reasoning

Steve Baker MP, the former Brexit minister and Deputy Chairman of the European Research Group (ERG) who voted against the Withdrawal Agreement, has revealed that he wrestled with whether or not to back it until the last minute.

“As late as last night I was sitting in the library here writing an article on how I was going to be forced to vote for the agreement, because in the Commons we’re beaten on the numbers,” he confessed.

“But I just realised I’m not going to surrender; it’s a rotten deal for the UK, the voters know it, they’re here today telling me so, and I concluded I’m never going to surrender to vote for this deal and this backstop,” he told Sky News.

He also reiterated his near-instantaneous call for Mrs May to go in the wake of her defeat, saying she had “used up all her political capital” in her failed efforts to get the deal over the line.

“Really, it is time to accept that this deal’s not going through, it is no good [to] keep following the same path, so I would like the Government to go to this [European] Council which has been announced [on April 10th] and ask for changes on the backstop,” he insisted.

“There’s a lot we don’t like about this agreement, but the backstop means we would indefinitely be trapped.”

The EU has insisted the backstop is no longer up for discussion, however, meaning Mr Baker’s strategy would be unlikely to bear fruit — although, as he would be content to accept No Deal rather than a bad deal, this would perhaps cause him less consternation than it causes the Remainers who have been in charge of Brexit up to now.

“The House of Commons, I’m afraid, has proven itself to be weak and incompetent, there’s people saying they want to leave the European Union, rejecting the deal, rejecting the deal, rejecting all the alternatives, rejecting… contingency arrangements,” he blasted, referring to the so-called “indicative votes” in which MPs rejected every Brexit option put to them.

He insisted he had not voted against Brexit by rejecting the deal, saying it was not a Brexit “worth having”.

“People aren’t fools, there’s normal people following these issues coming up to me and thanking me for voting this deal down. No, this was a rotten deal for the UK, triple-locking us into the institutions. It was as little Brexit as possible; it appears to be designed to facilitate us going back in later, and so we’ve rejected it,” he explained.

“That’s why the backstop needs to change because it’s the one thing that was indefinite. If we can change it so it’s not indefinite then we could potentially vote for it and move on,” he concluded.

He added that he would not resign from the Tory party, as previously suggested, as he had a duty to his constituency association to hold his seat as a Conservative Party MP.

UPDATE 1830 — Nigel Farage’s speech to the Brexit Betrayal Protest

Nigel Farage has told crowds that he will fight the European Parliament elections, should the UK be forced into contesting them by a lengthy Brexit delay.

Striking an optimistic note on a day where the Brexit vote has been betrayed and many may be feeling somewhat downcast, the Brexit leader told the crowd:

I can’t think of any time in history, where a greater betrayal of a democratic vote has ever happened in the Western world, and they can tonight over there content themselves because they think they’re winning. But that’s because they live in the Westminster bubble. We’re the real people of this country, and we know that the referendum was the first of many great victories.

UPDATE 1538 — EU’s Executive Arm: ‘No Deal Now Likely Scenario’

The European Commission has said that in light of today’s vote, “a ‘no deal’ on 12 April is now a likely scenario.”

In terms that Eurocrats may believe are a threat to the UK — but to be welcomed by those who want the will of the British people honoured — the bloc said that it is ready for a no deal exit on April 12. They have tweeted their full statement:

"No-deal” scenario on 12 April is now a likely scenario. The EU has been preparing for this since 12/2017. Now fully prepared. We will remain united.

UPDATE 1530 — The Fishing For Leave Boat has arrived in Westminster

The Leave Means Leave march from Sunderland to London has arrived in London, and a rally led by Nigel Farage and other leading Brexiteers is due to take place in Parliament Square in little under an hours time.

A particular feature of this march has been a traditional style fishing boat carried south on the back of a truck, in the style of a funeral carriage. It now appears to have arrived in Westminster and is outside the Parliamentary estate now.

UPDATE 1525 — Leader of Failing Pro-EU Party Vince Cable Calls for Second Referendum

Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable has echoed the calls of other Remainers for another referendum after Parliament voted against Mrs May’s ‘deal’, after it had voted to rule out a clean, no deal exit, saying “The only route to resolve the crisis is a final say with the option to Remain in the EU.”

“A long extension to Article 50 is now clearly needed, and a People’s Vote is the best way to persuade European leaders to agree one,” he added.

UPDATE 1523 — Britain’s Oldest Conservative Think Tank the Bow Group Condemns those Tories Who Sold out to Vote for May’s Failing ‘Deal’

Chairman of the Bow Group Ben Harris-Quinney told Breitbart London:

Several weeks ago several intermediaries were being used by Number 10 to reach out to Brexit supporting groups including the Bow Group to ask us to support May’s deal. Some like Matthew Elliott capitulated under unclear conditions, but our demands were clear: The Bow Group will only support a withdrawal agreement that restores all sovereign powers to the United Kingdom, that comes alongside widespread democratic reforms within the Conservative Party so that candidates and leaders are elected not selected, and a strong immigration White Paper. The response from Number 10 was that none of these conditions would even be considered, but that we should support the deal anyway. I have never encountered such arrogance and catastrophic miscalculation of the realpolitik of a situation. There was a pig-headed unwillingness by Number 10 to wake up to the political reality. Instead they have made fools of themselves and by extension this country with their childlike misunderstanding of political reality. The membership of the Conservative Party will no doubt wish to investigate how these amateurs came to unaccountably lead what was once the greatest political party in Britain. As for the way forward for Brexit, unless an acceptable withdrawal agreement is presented we believe the best course to deliver the Brexit that was on the ballot is a no deal/WTO scenario on April 12th. Potential Conservative leadership candidates like Michael Gove and Boris Johnson, who by their own admission are not conservatives and have not been long-term Brexiteers, have done their leadership ambitions huge damage – Both in supporting May’s deal because of its betrayal of Brexit, but also their naive miscalculation of of how things were likely to play out in the Chamber today. The Bow Group is immensely proud of our Senior Patrons Sir John Redwood and Sir Bill Cash who have shown great calm under pressure to honestly stick to their principles not only today, but throughout their long political careers. It so happens to be our President Lord Tebbit’s birthday today, and we wish him many happy returns in a life that has also been underwritten by unwavering principle. The same can be said for almost all those Tory MPs who voted against this betrayal of Brexit. In a time when faith in politics is at an all time low, it is an honour to stand alongside the incorruptible torch bearers of the true spirit of the Conservative Party, however few of them remain.

UPDATE 1510 — Time for change?

Leave.EU, the larger of the two major Brexit campaign during the EU referendum in 2016, close to Nigel Farage, has welcomed the defeat of Mrs May’s deal, and called for her to step down and make way for “a proper leader who believes in Brexit” and will deliver a WTO, or No Deal, Brexit.

Another whopping defeat for May's surrender document and now she's talking about a long delay to Brexit. Time for her to resign so we can get a proper leader who believes in Brexit. We must go WTO! — Leave.EU (@LeaveEUOfficial) March 29, 2019

28 Brexiteer Tory “Spartans” voted against the Withdrawal Agreement, including former Brexit minister Steve Baker, European Research Group (ERG) Vice Chairman Mark Francois, and veteran eurosceptic Sir Bill Cash.

UPDATE 1509 — Dominic Grieve revives Remainer hopes for a Second Referendum in wake of third May defeat

Mr Grieve, who is potentially facing deselection in his own constituency, reminded that with the Remainer-dominated House of Commons voting down leaving in a clean, no deal Brexit he sees room for a second referendum.

The former attorney-general said, “My view has always been that whatever deal we get we should go back to the electorate and ask them” with the options being accepting May’s deal and staying in the EU.

UPDATE, 1507 — Sky News cites EU sources mooting no deal Brexit

The European Commission, the unelected executive which has been leading the Brexit negotiations for the EU, has said it now believes a No Deal break with the United Kingdom on April 12th is a “likely scenario” — despite majority opposition to this by British politicians, and a widespread expectation that the European Council will offer the UK a long delay to Brexit, possibly to April 2020.

The European Commission says a 'no-deal' Brexit on Friday 12 April is now a "likely scenario" — Sky News Breaking (@SkyNewsBreak) March 29, 2019

A full, no deal Brexit isn’t without friends in the United Kingdom despite the deep animosity towards it from the House of Commons, however. As reported by Breitbart London this morning, a respected economist and former governor of the Bank of England Mervyn King dismissed the claims of so-called project fear, and criticised politicians for having a collective “nervous breakdown” over Brexit.

Speaking to the BBC Friday morning, Lord King said:

My own personal preference would be to go back to Europe and say we have a clear strategy which is we want to leave without a deal. But we would like to take six months to complete the preparations to avoid the dislocation… I would like to see us say that we will leave without a deal, a certain distance ahead, which would give the country time to make those preparations and then I think we’d be in a much stronger situation.

UPDATE 1500 — What does this mean?

The United Kingdom has now defaulted to a clean, No Deal exit on the new April 12th deadline agreed at the European Council meeting where the Prime Minister agreed an extension of the Article 50 negotiating period with the bloc, but it seems likely that a Remainer-dominated House of Commons clearly opposed to No Deal will not allow this to happen.

“The implication of the House’s decision is now grave,” the Prime Minister told the House. “[There] is not enough time to agree legislature and ratify a deal and the House has voted to not leave without a deal and so we will have to agree an alternative way forward,” she observed.

MPs will now hold a new round of so-called “indicative votes” on Monday, to tease out a possible way forward.

The last of these ended in stalemates, with the House rejecting all possible options, including No Deal, revocation of Article 50, and a public vote on Mrs May’s deal.

UPDATE 1454 — European Elections now loom on the horizon

Speaking to Sky News, Independent Group (now Change UK Party, as of today) spokesman Chukka Umunna discusses preparing to field candidates for potential European Parliament elections which may now take place in May. No doubt, several other parties — including Nigel Farage’s new Brexit party, will be thinking the same way after the vote.

UPDATE 1451 — EU to convene an emergency meeting to respond

President of the European Council Donald Tusk has announced that he will be calling a meeting of the European Council on April 10th in response to the failure of Mrs May’s deal — two day’s before the new deadline for a No Deal exit.

In view of the rejection of the Withdrawal Agreement by the House of Commons, I have decided to call a European Council on 10 April. #Brexit — Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) March 29, 2019

UPDATE 1450 — The Prime Minister responds

Getting to her feet after the vote, the Prime Minister said:

The implication of the House’s decision is now grave. The legal default is the United Kingdom is to leave the European Union on the 12th of Aprill. That is not enough time to agree legislature and ratify a deal and the House has voted to not leave without a deal and so we will have to agree an alternative way forward. The European Union has been clear than any further extension will need to have a clear purpose and be agreed unanimously by the 27 heads of state before the 12th of April. It is now almost certain to involve the UK being required to hold European Parliament elections. On Monday this House will continue to see if there is majority for a particular future relationship with the EU. I fear we are reaching the limits of the options of this House. This House has rejected no deal, this House has rejected no brexit on Wednesday. It rejected all the variations of the deal on the table and have rejected the withdrawal on its own. This government will continue to press the case for an orderly brexit that the result of the referendum demands.

Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn hits back, saying the Prime Minister should leave office and hold a general election. Interestingly he also states that today is the third vote on May’s deal — a truth unspoken by the government as part of the pretence to get the Withdrawal Agreement before parliament again in face of the Speaker’s ban on bringing the same legislation repeatedly.

UPDATE 1442 — Government defeated 344 — 286

As expected, the House has voted against the government’s Brexit ‘deal’ for the third time, falling short by 58 votes. The Prime Minister says this means the United Kingdom is on course to leave the European Union on April 12th without a deal — but acknowledges the Commons will not permit this happening.

The country will have to hold European Union elections in the month of May, therefore. If a real ‘no-deal’ Brexit is a nightmare for Parliament, then holding elections the mainstream parties are likely to be hammered at must come a close second.

UPDATE 1427 — Bercow announces divisions

After a morning of speeches in the chamber, including an impassioned speech by the Prime Minister in defence of her deal, the Speaker of the House has called divisions — meaning members have gone to the lobbies to vote. We can expect a result in 15 to 20 minutes.

Defending her deal against the persistent feeling that her Brexit settlement with Europe is no real Brexit at all, the Prime Minister appeared to plead with the house, telling them voting for her deal is the “the last opportunity to guarantee Brexit”.

The Prime Minister said:

Today’s motion is not about a blind breit is it a guarantee to brexit today we can give the public and business the certainty they need today.Today we can show we can stand by our word. Today we can come together in the national interest Today we can take a step forward together this is a difficult day for mema crso the house by asking member to take a hard decision and asking some honourable members to vote for a brexit that is less than they hoped for and that is not east. I’m asking the opposition to deliver on instruction of British people and that is not easy either.” I have said I am prepared to leave this job earlier than intended to secure the right outcome for our country and when the devision bell rings in a few moments’ time, everyone one of us will have to look into our hearts to see what is right for our constituencies and our country.

How did we get here?

By Jack Montgomery

Before now, the prime minister had assured Leave voters that “no deal is better than a bad deal” and promised no less than 108 times that the UK would be leaving the EU, come what may, on March 29th 2019.

However, after the Withdrawal Agreement she negotiated with the bloc — allegedly behind the backs of ministers at the Brexiteer-led Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU) — was rejected by Parliament twice, she reversed course, asking the European Council for an extension of the two-year Article 50 exit negotiations commenced in 2017, over the objections of Tory activists and most of her own MPs.

The EU granted the Tory leader a shorter stay of execution than she was asking for, and MPs must vote today for her agreement so Britain can leave the EU under its terms on May 22nd.

If they do not, the country defaults to a No Deal exit on April 12th — although it is widely expected that the Remain-dominated House of Commons would move swiftly to prevent this, instead forcing the Government to request a much longer extension, with or without Mrs May, with the EU reportedly ready to push exit deadline all the way to April Fools’ Day in 2020.

What happens if the deal does pass?

If the deal does make it through the House of Commons somehow, it is likely that the United Kingdom will leave the EU under its terms on May 22nd — at least in name.

Britain would not participate in the European Parliament elections in May, and would lose its MEPs and European Council representation, but would remain an EU member in all other respects until the end of a so-called “transition period” in which negotiations between the British government — under new leadership, assuming Mrs May keeps her promise to stand down — and Brussels.

If no future partnership is agreed during this transition, which could last all the way to the end of December 2022, the deal makes provisions for the so-called “backstop” to come into force, with Great Britain (England, Scotland, and Wales) being incorporated into an EU-controlled “single customs territory”, while Northern Ireland would be effectively annexed into the EU Customs Union and Single Market proper.

This is considered an unacceptable outcome by virtually all sides of the Brexit debate, and the deal does not allow for Britain to break the arrangement without the EU’s permission — leading to fears that Remainers will simply reopen the question of whether the UK should simply revert seamlessly to full EU membership once the transition is over.

Do we know what will happen next if the deal does not pass?

Legally, the United Kingdom should simply leave the EU cleanly on April 12th on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms if the deal does not pass — otherwise known as a “No Deal” or “Hard” Brexit.

However, this was also supposed to be the cast for March 29th, and the British government, Parliament, and European Union instead contrived for Brexit to be delayed.

It is expected that the same thing will happen if the deal fails today, with the overwhelming majority of MPs voting to reject a No Deal Brexit in a series of “indicative votes”.

However, MPs also voted against every other alternative, including pushing for an even weaker form of Brexit, holding another referendum, and revoking Article 50 — which would essentially cancel the Brexit process.

This leaves the country in an invidious position, where a Leave-supporting populace is served by a Remain-supporting Parliament which has voted against every available Brexit, and where no party commands an overall majority.

A long extension, as the EU has been pushing for with increasing confidence, seems to be the inevitable outcome, assuming the bloc itself does not force a No Deal — as some Brexiteers have been hoping.

This would likely mean Britain would have to participate in the European Parliament elections in May — an event which could serve as something of a proxy second referendum, with parties opposed to Brexit facing off against Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party and Gerard Batten’s UKIP — and a British general election, in which the Tories would likely be under new management.

What strategy for Brexit the Leaver-backed but Remainer-led party would be putting to the people at such an election, however, is unclear.

This story is developing, more follows


Britain’s House of Commons has voted to reject Theresa May’s so-called Withdrawal Agreement just hours before the nation was supposed to leave the European Union, with or without a deal — a deadline betrayed this week by Parliament after they voted to postpone Brexit months or even years into the future.

Britain’s lawmakers have already voted against the settlement the Prime Minister agreed with the European Union twice, and the government was blocked from bringing it to Parliament again. Yet by splitting the deal into two pieces, the ‘Brexit in name only‘ apparently comes before Parliament again as a different vote in spirit only.

UPDATE 1830 — Nigel speaks to the rally

Nigel Farage has struck an optimistic note on this day of Brexit betrayal, telling the Parliament square rally:

I can’t think of any time in history, where a greater betrayal of a democratic vote has ever happened in the Western world, and they can tonight over there content themselves because they think they’re winning. But that’s because they live in the Westminster bubble. We’re the real people of this country, and we know that the referendum was the first of many great victories. We will get our country back, we will get out independence back, we will get out pride and self-respect back. We are going to win!

UPDATE 1710 — May meets cabinet members

The Prime Minister is reportedly meeting with a delegation of Cabinet ministers, who are thought to be urging her to adopt an even weaker form of Brexit than the one outlined in the seemingly abandoned Political Declaration which formerly accompanied the thrice-defeated Withdrawal Agreement, possibly involving full membership of the EU Customs Union, or “a” customs union which would have the same practical effect.

This would almost certainly kill any chance of the United Kingdom being able to strike new trade deals with countries like the United States, Australia, and New Zealand after Brexit, and leave the EU able to barter access to British markets without Britain’s political representatives having any say in the matter while striking its own trade deals.

Meanwhile, Nigel Farage is enjoying the crowds in Parliament Square…

UPDATE 1705 — EU’s Brexit Negotiator Floats Upgrading May’s ‘Worst Deal Ever’ to ‘Worst Deal Ever Plus Customs Union’

In comments reported by politico.eu, Michel Barnier suggested that the EU he was open to a deal which would mean the UK would maintain the same tariffs and trade policies as the EU, appealing to Remainer parliamentarians who want to stop a clean break.

“We are ready to be even more ambitious should the U.K.’s red-lines evolve. For instance, we are open to work on the principle of a permanent customs union should the U.K. decide to take this path,” Mr Barnier said at the College of Europe campus in Warsaw, Poland.

However, Barnier added, “Let me be frank: Without a positive choice, the default option would be a no-deal, which has become more likely. It was never our scenario, but the EU27 is now prepared.”

UPDATE 1650 — Tory Brexiteer cautions against optimism

Veteran Tory MP Michael Fabricant has warned that, “If #Brexiteers think that a victory has been won, because #Remainers and #Labour voted down the #Deal, think again.”

Mr Fabricant, a Brexiteer himself, who backed the deal with some reluctance, predicted that “On Monday, the #Remainer Parliament will try to keep us in the Customs Union which means our obeying #EU legislation and having no say in making them. Worse than [before]”.

However, the deal would have involved also have involved a “transition period” lasting to the end of December 2022 in which Britain would have essentially remained a full member of the European Union, minus its representation in the EU institutions — with Remainers able to push for a switch back to formal membership at the end of it if the despised backstop remained the only deal on offer.

UPDATE 1625 — Europe mouthpiece Ireland talks up long Brexit delay

Irish taoiseach (prime minister) Leo Varadkar is set for to meet with Germany’s Angela Merkel and France’s Emmanuel Macron for crunch talks in the wake of the Withdrawal Agreement’s rejection.

“These two meetings reflect the deep and warm relations Ireland enjoys with both France and Germany, including the support shown to Ireland during the Brexit negotiations,” said a spokesman for the Irish leader, who has been extremely combative throughout the EU’s talks with the British, despite his country’s heavy economic dependence on trade both with and via the United Kingdom, and the enormous blow which would fall on it in the event of No Deal.

“The [Irish] Government notes the decision of the House of Commons to reject the indicative Withdrawal Agreement. It is now up to the UK to indicate how it plans to proceed in order to avoid a No Deal scenario,” the taoiseach remarked in a separate statement on the British vote.

“We must be open to a long extension, should the United Kingdom decide to fundamentally reconsider its approach to Brexit,” he added.

UPDATE 1610 — In other news…

The Independent Group have chosen today to rebrand themselves as a political party in time, they hope, to challenge the potential European Parliament elections in May.

To the amusement of some on social media, they have chosen to call themselves the Change UK party — odd, given they are campaigning to keep things the same. Read more on Breitbart London:

UPDATE 1605 — Sir Bernard Jenkin: There are only 160 MPs who really believe in leaving the European Union

Saying that the most likely outcome of today’s developments was a longer extension, Sir Bernard said, “This only arises because there are about 160 MPs in parliament who really believe in leaving the European Union and the withdrawal agreement we ended up with was negotiated in such a way as to keep us poised to rejoin at some stage.

On Prime Minister Theresa May’s successor, the Tory Brexiteer said, “I think it’s important to have somebody that has the confidence of the whole party and we don’t have another kind of coronation like we had last time.

“I think the membership of the party must have the final choice and that makes its very likely we end up with someone who supports leave the European Union.

“We can’t have another prime minister who says she wants to leave the European Union and respects the result when they don’t believe in that project… putting someone in charge of a project they don’t believe in doesn’t work as we’ve learnt.”

Sir Bernard echoes the sentiments of former Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith who said told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme this morning, “We want the second phase [of Brexit negotiations] to be led by someone who passionately believes in what 17.4 million people voted for, which was to leave the European Union.”

“Now is the time for a new set of hands with a proper professional team that actually believes in Brexit and gets us through the next phase,” Mr Duncan Smith added.

UPDATE 1556 — Pro-Brexit demonstrators gathering outside Parliament

Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage has welcomed the defeat of Mrs May’s deal, but warned that it appears there are now fresh battles ahead for Brexiteers.

“The new EU treaty has been rightly defeated for a third time. Extension and further battles now seem inevitable,” he observed, vowing: “We are not downhearted, and will fight them again”

UPDATE 1542 — Diehard Brexiteer gives his reasoning

Steve Baker MP, the former Brexit minister and Deputy Chairman of the European Research Group (ERG) who voted against the Withdrawal Agreement, has revealed that he wrestled with whether or not to back it until the last minute.

“As late as last night I was sitting in the library here writing an article on how I was going to be forced to vote for the agreement, because in the Commons we’re beaten on the numbers,” he confessed.

“But I just realised I’m not going to surrender; it’s a rotten deal for the UK, the voters know it, they’re here today telling me so, and I concluded I’m never going to surrender to vote for this deal and this backstop,” he told Sky News.

He also reiterated his near-instantaneous call for Mrs May to go in the wake of her defeat, saying she had “used up all her political capital” in her failed efforts to get the deal over the line.

“Really, it is time to accept that this deal’s not going through, it is no good [to] keep following the same path, so I would like the Government to go to this [European] Council which has been announced [on April 10th] and ask for changes on the backstop,” he insisted.

“There’s a lot we don’t like about this agreement, but the backstop means we would indefinitely be trapped.”

The EU has insisted the backstop is no longer up for discussion, however, meaning Mr Baker’s strategy would be unlikely to bear fruit — although, as he would be content to accept No Deal rather than a bad deal, this would perhaps cause him less consternation than it causes the Remainers who have been in charge of Brexit up to now.

“The House of Commons, I’m afraid, has proven itself to be weak and incompetent, there’s people saying they want to leave the European Union, rejecting the deal, rejecting the deal, rejecting all the alternatives, rejecting… contingency arrangements,” he blasted, referring to the so-called “indicative votes” in which MPs rejected every Brexit option put to them.

He insisted he had not voted against Brexit by rejecting the deal, saying it was not a Brexit “worth having”.

“People aren’t fools, there’s normal people following these issues coming up to me and thanking me for voting this deal down. No, this was a rotten deal for the UK, triple-locking us into the institutions. It was as little Brexit as possible; it appears to be designed to facilitate us going back in later, and so we’ve rejected it,” he explained.

“That’s why the backstop needs to change because it’s the one thing that was indefinite. If we can change it so it’s not indefinite then we could potentially vote for it and move on,” he concluded.

He added that he would not resign from the Tory party, as previously suggested, as he had a duty to his constituency association to hold his seat as a Conservative Party MP.

UPDATE 1830 — Nigel Farage’s speech to the Brexit Betrayal Protest

Nigel Farage has told crowds that he will fight the European Parliament elections, should the UK be forced into contesting them by a lengthy Brexit delay.

Striking an optimistic note on a day where the Brexit vote has been betrayed and many may be feeling somewhat downcast, the Brexit leader told the crowd:

I can’t think of any time in history, where a greater betrayal of a democratic vote has ever happened in the Western world, and they can tonight over there content themselves because they think they’re winning. But that’s because they live in the Westminster bubble. We’re the real people of this country, and we know that the referendum was the first of many great victories. We will get our country back, we will get out independence back, we will get out pride and self-respect back. We are going to win!

UPDATE 1538 — EU’s Executive Arm: ‘No Deal Now Likely Scenario’

The European Commission has said that in light of today’s vote, “a ‘no deal’ on 12 April is now a likely scenario.”

In terms that Eurocrats may believe are a threat to the UK — but to be welcomed by those who want the will of the British people honoured — the bloc said that it is ready for a no deal exit on April 12. They have tweeted their full statement:

"No-deal” scenario on 12 April is now a likely scenario. The EU has been preparing for this since 12/2017. Now fully prepared. We will remain united.

UPDATE 1530 — The Fishing For Leave Boat has arrived in Westminster

The Leave Means Leave march from Sunderland to London has arrived in London, and a rally led by Nigel Farage and other leading Brexiteers is due to take place in Parliament Square in little under an hours time.

A particular feature of this march has been a traditional style fishing boat carried south on the back of a truck, in the style of a funeral carriage. It now appears to have arrived in Westminster and is outside the Parliamentary estate now.

UPDATE 1525 — Leader of Failing Pro-EU Party Vince Cable Calls for Second Referendum

Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable has echoed the calls of other Remainers for another referendum after Parliament voted against Mrs May’s ‘deal’, after it had voted to rule out a clean, no deal exit, saying “The only route to resolve the crisis is a final say with the option to Remain in the EU.”

“A long extension to Article 50 is now clearly needed, and a People’s Vote is the best way to persuade European leaders to agree one,” he added.

UPDATE 1523 — Britain’s Oldest Conservative Think Tank the Bow Group Condemns those Tories Who Sold out to Vote for May’s Failing ‘Deal’

Chairman of the Bow Group Ben Harris-Quinney told Breitbart London:

Several weeks ago several intermediaries were being used by Number 10 to reach out to Brexit supporting groups including the Bow Group to ask us to support May’s deal. Some like Matthew Elliott capitulated under unclear conditions, but our demands were clear: The Bow Group will only support a withdrawal agreement that restores all sovereign powers to the United Kingdom, that comes alongside widespread democratic reforms within the Conservative Party so that candidates and leaders are elected not selected, and a strong immigration White Paper. The response from Number 10 was that none of these conditions would even be considered, but that we should support the deal anyway. I have never encountered such arrogance and catastrophic miscalculation of the realpolitik of a situation. There was a pig-headed unwillingness by Number 10 to wake up to the political reality. Instead they have made fools of themselves and by extension this country with their childlike misunderstanding of political reality. The membership of the Conservative Party will no doubt wish to investigate how these amateurs came to unaccountably lead what was once the greatest political party in Britain. As for the way forward for Brexit, unless an acceptable withdrawal agreement is presented we believe the best course to deliver the Brexit that was on the ballot is a no deal/WTO scenario on April 12th. Potential Conservative leadership candidates like Michael Gove and Boris Johnson, who by their own admission are not conservatives and have not been long-term Brexiteers, have done their leadership ambitions huge damage – Both in supporting May’s deal because of its betrayal of Brexit, but also their naive miscalculation of of how things were likely to play out in the Chamber today. The Bow Group is immensely proud of our Senior Patrons Sir John Redwood and Sir Bill Cash who have shown great calm under pressure to honestly stick to their principles not only today, but throughout their long political careers. It so happens to be our President Lord Tebbit’s birthday today, and we wish him many happy returns in a life that has also been underwritten by unwavering principle. The same can be said for almost all those Tory MPs who voted against this betrayal of Brexit. In a time when faith in politics is at an all time low, it is an honour to stand alongside the incorruptible torch bearers of the true spirit of the Conservative Party, however few of them remain.

UPDATE 1510 — Time for change?

Leave.EU, the larger of the two major Brexit campaign during the EU referendum in 2016, close to Nigel Farage, has welcomed the defeat of Mrs May’s deal, and called for her to step down and make way for “a proper leader who believes in Brexit” and will deliver a WTO, or No Deal, Brexit.

UPDATE 1509 — Dominic Grieve revives Remainer hopes for a Second Referendum in wake of third May defeat

Mr Grieve, who is potentially facing deselection in his own constituency, reminded that with the Remainer-dominated House of Commons voting down leaving in a clean, no deal Brexit he sees room for a second referendum.

The former attorney-general said, “My view has always been that whatever deal we get we should go back to the electorate and ask them” with the options being accepting May’s deal and staying in the EU.

UPDATE, 1507 — Sky News cites EU sources mooting no deal Brexit

The European Commission, the unelected executive which has been leading the Brexit negotiations for the EU, has said it now believes a No Deal break with the United Kingdom on April 12th is a “likely scenario” — despite majority opposition to this by British politicians, and a widespread expectation that the European Council will offer the UK a long delay to Brexit, possibly to April 2020.

The European Commission says a 'no-deal' Brexit on Friday 12 April is now a "likely scenario" — Sky News Breaking (@SkyNewsBreak) March 29, 2019

A full, no deal Brexit isn’t without friends in the United Kingdom despite the deep animosity towards it from the House of Commons, however. As reported by Breitbart London this morning, a respected economist and former governor of the Bank of England Mervyn King dismissed the claims of so-called project fear, and criticised politicians for having a collective “nervous breakdown” over Brexit.

Speaking to the BBC Friday morning, Lord King said:

My own personal preference would be to go back to Europe and say we have a clear strategy which is we want to leave without a deal. But we would like to take six months to complete the preparations to avoid the dislocation… I would like to see us say that we will leave without a deal, a certain distance ahead, which would give the country time to make those preparations and then I think we’d be in a much stronger situation.

UPDATE 1500 — What does this mean?

The United Kingdom has now defaulted to a clean, No Deal exit on the new April 12th deadline agreed at the European Council meeting where the Prime Minister agreed an extension of the Article 50 negotiating period with the bloc, but it seems likely that a Remainer-dominated House of Commons clearly opposed to No Deal will not allow this to happen.

“The implication of the House’s decision is now grave,” the Prime Minister told the House. “[There] is not enough time to agree legislature and ratify a deal and the House has voted to not leave without a deal and so we will have to agree an alternative way forward,” she observed.

MPs will now hold a new round of so-called “indicative votes” on Monday, to tease out a possible way forward.

The last of these ended in stalemates, with the House rejecting all possible options, including No Deal, revocation of Article 50, and a public vote on Mrs May’s deal.

UPDATE 1454 — European Elections now loom on the horizon

Speaking to Sky News, Independent Group (now Change UK Party, as of today) spokesman Chukka Umunna discusses preparing to field candidates for potential European Parliament elections which may now take place in May. No doubt, several other parties — including Nigel Farage’s new Brexit party, will be thinking the same way after the vote.

UPDATE 1451 — EU to convene an emergency meeting to respond

President of the European Council Donald Tusk has announced that he will be calling a meeting of the European Council on April 10th in response to the failure of Mrs May’s deal — two day’s before the new deadline for a No Deal exit.

In view of the rejection of the Withdrawal Agreement by the House of Commons, I have decided to call a European Council on 10 April. #Brexit — Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) March 29, 2019

UPDATE 1450 — The Prime Minister responds

Getting to her feet after the vote, the Prime Minister said:

The implication of the House’s decision is now grave. The legal default is the United Kingdom is to leave the European Union on the 12th of Aprill. That is not enough time to agree legislature and ratify a deal and the House has voted to not leave without a deal and so we will have to agree an alternative way forward. The European Union has been clear than any further extension will need to have a clear purpose and be agreed unanimously by the 27 heads of state before the 12th of April. It is now almost certain to involve the UK being required to hold European Parliament elections. On Monday this House will continue to see if there is majority for a particular future relationship with the EU. I fear we are reaching the limits of the options of this House. This House has rejected no deal, this House has rejected no brexit on Wednesday. It rejected all the variations of the deal on the table and have rejected the withdrawal on its own. This government will continue to press the case for an orderly brexit that the result of the referendum demands.

Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn hits back, saying the Prime Minister should leave office and hold a general election. Interestingly he also states that today is the third vote on May’s deal — a truth unspoken by the government as part of the pretence to get the Withdrawal Agreement before parliament again in face of the Speaker’s ban on bringing the same legislation repeatedly.

UPDATE 1442 — Government defeated 344 — 286

As expected, the House has voted against the government’s Brexit ‘deal’ for the third time, falling short by 58 votes. The Prime Minister says this means the United Kingdom is on course to leave the European Union on April 12th without a deal — but acknowledges the Commons will not permit this happening.

The country will have to hold European Union elections in the month of May, therefore. If a real ‘no-deal’ Brexit is a nightmare for Parliament, then holding elections the mainstream parties are likely to be hammered at must come a close second.

UPDATE 1427 — Bercow announces divisions

After a morning of speeches in the chamber, including an impassioned speech by the Prime Minister in defence of her deal, the Speaker of the House has called divisions — meaning members have gone to the lobbies to vote. We can expect a result in 15 to 20 minutes.

Defending her deal against the persistent feeling that her Brexit settlement with Europe is no real Brexit at all, the Prime Minister appeared to plead with the house, telling them voting for her deal is the “the last opportunity to guarantee Brexit”.

The Prime Minister said:

Today’s motion is not about a blind breit is it a guarantee to brexit today we can give the public and business the certainty they need today.Today we can show we can stand by our word. Today we can come together in the national interest Today we can take a step forward together this is a difficult day for mema crso the house by asking member to take a hard decision and asking some honourable members to vote for a brexit that is less than they hoped for and that is not east. I’m asking the opposition to deliver on instruction of British people and that is not easy either.” I have said I am prepared to leave this job earlier than intended to secure the right outcome for our country and when the devision bell rings in a few moments’ time, everyone one of us will have to look into our hearts to see what is right for our constituencies and our country.

How did we get here?

By Jack Montgomery

Before now, the prime minister had assured Leave voters that “no deal is better than a bad deal” and promised no less than 108 times that the UK would be leaving the EU, come what may, on March 29th 2019.

However, after the Withdrawal Agreement she negotiated with the bloc — allegedly behind the backs of ministers at the Brexiteer-led Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU) — was rejected by Parliament twice, she reversed course, asking the European Council for an extension of the two-year Article 50 exit negotiations commenced in 2017, over the objections of Tory activists and most of her own MPs.

The EU granted the Tory leader a shorter stay of execution than she was asking for, and MPs must vote today for her agreement so Britain can leave the EU under its terms on May 22nd.

If they do not, the country defaults to a No Deal exit on April 12th — although it is widely expected that the Remain-dominated House of Commons would move swiftly to prevent this, instead forcing the Government to request a much longer extension, with or without Mrs May, with the EU reportedly ready to push exit deadline all the way to April Fools’ Day in 2020.

What happens if the deal does pass?

If the deal does make it through the House of Commons somehow, it is likely that the United Kingdom will leave the EU under its terms on May 22nd — at least in name.

Britain would not participate in the European Parliament elections in May, and would lose its MEPs and European Council representation, but would remain an EU member in all other respects until the end of a so-called “transition period” in which negotiations between the British government — under new leadership, assuming Mrs May keeps her promise to stand down — and Brussels.

If no future partnership is agreed during this transition, which could last all the way to the end of December 2022, the deal makes provisions for the so-called “backstop” to come into force, with Great Britain (England, Scotland, and Wales) being incorporated into an EU-controlled “single customs territory”, while Northern Ireland would be effectively annexed into the EU Customs Union and Single Market proper.

This is considered an unacceptable outcome by virtually all sides of the Brexit debate, and the deal does not allow for Britain to break the arrangement without the EU’s permission — leading to fears that Remainers will simply reopen the question of whether the UK should simply revert seamlessly to full EU membership once the transition is over.

Do we know what will happen next if the deal does not pass?

Legally, the United Kingdom should simply leave the EU cleanly on April 12th on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms if the deal does not pass — otherwise known as a “No Deal” or “Hard” Brexit.

However, this was also supposed to be the cast for March 29th, and the British government, Parliament, and European Union instead contrived for Brexit to be delayed.

It is expected that the same thing will happen if the deal fails today, with the overwhelming majority of MPs voting to reject a No Deal Brexit in a series of “indicative votes”.

However, MPs also voted against every other alternative, including pushing for an even weaker form of Brexit, holding another referendum, and revoking Article 50 — which would essentially cancel the Brexit process.

This leaves the country in an invidious position, where a Leave-supporting populace is served by a Remain-supporting Parliament which has voted against every available Brexit, and where no party commands an overall majority.

A long extension, as the EU has been pushing for with increasing confidence, seems to be the inevitable outcome, assuming the bloc itself does not force a No Deal — as some Brexiteers have been hoping.

This would likely mean Britain would have to participate in the European Parliament elections in May — an event which could serve as something of a proxy second referendum, with parties opposed to Brexit facing off against Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party and Gerard Batten’s UKIP — and a British general election, in which the Tories would likely be under new management.

What strategy for Brexit the Leaver-backed but Remainer-led party would be putting to the people at such an election, however, is unclear.

President Donald Trump issued an executive order on Tuesday directing the federal government to prepare a coordinated response plan in the event of an electromagnetic pulse attack (EMP). The order described the enormous damage such an attack could cause and noted the U.S. government currently lacks a coherent plan of action for responding to one.

The minimal media coverage given to Trump’s order was bizarrely contemptuous, as though he had just issued an order to prepare defenses against flying saucers or flesh-eating zombies. The Washington Post headline was “Trump issued an executive order to prepare for an EMP attack. What is it, and should you worry?”

The Post answered its own question with the subhead, “Nah. But the U.S. should get ready for a very similar threat – from the sun.”

Other publications dismissed the EMP threat as “mythical” or mere science fiction, even though the phenomenon of electromagnetic energy from a nuclear detonation interfering with electronics and power transmission systems is far better established than “climate change,” which many of these same publications vehemently insist is not mythical at all and must be fought immediately at unlimited cost in money and human lives.

Perhaps some of those criticizing Trump for his executive order believe it will pave the way for recommendations as deranged and extreme as those frequently demanded for climate change. Trump’s order is nothing like the “Green New Deal,” however. It simply instructs federal agencies to prepare evaluations and submit reports by certain fixed deadlines. Telling federal bureaucrats to file some reports is hardly a stunning break with executive precedent.

It should be noted that some of the publications hammering Trump for issuing his EMP executive order found it quite charming when the Obama administration really did prepare response plans for flesh-eating zombie attacks, using multiple federal agencies. This tomfoolery was justified on the grounds that it made training exercises fun and captured the imagination of the public.

Anti-Trump animus obviously drives much of the derogatory coverage, along with heavy media bias against the people and organizations who have been warning about EMP weapons for years. It pleases critics to imagine the EMP threat is a mindless obsession of paranoids and doomsday preppers, even though the technology to generate electromagnetic pulses definitely exists and their effect on delicate electronic systems would be catastrophic. The threat is “mythical” in the same sense that a massive Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor would have been mythical in November 1941, or terrorists flying hijacked planes into skyscrapers would have mythical in August 2001.

Comparing a targeted EMP strike to solar flares as the Washington Post does is dangerously absurd, but Trump’s executive order does mention natural disruptions in its very first paragraph, so environmental dangers are not overlooked. The order defines electromagnetic pulses as follows:

“Electromagnetic pulse” is a burst of electromagnetic energy. EMPs have the potential to negatively affect technology systems on Earth and in space. A high-altitude EMP (HEMP) is a type of human-made EMP that occurs when a nuclear device is detonated at approximately 40 kilometers or more above the surface of Earth. A geomagnetic disturbance (GMD) is a type of natural EMP driven by a temporary disturbance of Earth’s magnetic field resulting from interactions with solar eruptions. Both HEMPs and GMDs can affect large geographic areas.

The point of the order is that we currently lack a coordinated strategy to deal with any significant disruption of the sensitive equipment our society is almost entirely reliant upon. That equipment has only existed for a few decades, so history offers little precedent for how to deal with a deliberate attack, and no reason to believe natural forces cannot cause disruption on a catastrophic scale.

It is particularly strange to see anyone mocking the White House for taking the matter seriously when Venezuela is currently showing the world a horrifying example of what happens to crowded cities when the lights go out. As a matter of fact, the Venezuelan dictatorship has made laughable attempts at blaming the nationwide blackouts on an EMP attack perpetrated by dissidents with the aid of the U.S. government. A real EMP strike would be orders of magnitude worse than the hardships imposed on Venezuela by socialism.

Trump’s executive order was not extravagant. The actions directed by the White House boil down to asking agency heads to seriously estimate the consequences of EMP attacks on various scales and prepare cogent response plans. Maintaining communications between military units and emergency responders in the event of an EMP was given high priority. Such considerations are essentially why the primordial Internet was created by the Defense Department decades ago. Ironically, our dependence on the Internet makes us more vulnerable to electromagnetic attack than ever.

Concern about attacks on America’s communications and energy infrastructure are not new. Analysts inside and outside the government have been warning about the vulnerability of the power grid to everything from cyber-espionage to brute-force vandalism for many years. Criticizing the Trump administration for getting serious about those vulnerabilities, simply because it dares to imagine the worst-case scenario, is highly irresponsible.

Among those applauding President Trump’s executive order was Dr. Peter Vincent Pry, who noted in The Hill on Thursday that the Congressional EMP Commission has been advising better preparedness for almost 20 years.

Pry, formerly chief of staff for that commission, cited strong bipartisan support for getting serious about EMP defense:

Republican leaders on EMP preparedness have included Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Ted Cruz of Texas, Reps. Doug Lamborn of Colorado and Michael McCaul of Texas, former Reps. Roscoe Bartlett of Maryland and Curt Weldon of Pennsylvania, and Texas state Sen. Bob Hall. Democratic leaders have included former Sen. Jim Webb of Virginia, Sen. Edward Markey of Massachusetts, Reps. Yvette Clarke of New York and Benny Thompson of Mississippi, former Rep. Henry Waxman of California, and former state Reps. Andrea Boland of Maine, Joan Ginal of Colorado and Michelle Rehwinkel Vasilinda of Florida. Aside from President Trump himself, the greatest credit for the EMP Executive Order goes to William R. Graham, chairman of the Congressional EMP Commission since 2001 and former White House science adviser to President Reagan, who ran NASA and was on the defense science team that discovered the EMP phenomenon during the Starfish Prime nuclear test in 1962. Dr. Graham has spent a professional lifetime trying to protect civilization from the existential threat that is EMP.

Pry framed EMP weapons as a subset of cyber warfare, which no one in the right minds would dismiss as a mythical or exaggerated threat, even though large-scale adversary-directed computer warfare hasn’t happened yet either.

As bad as some of the hacks have been over the past few decades, many of them directed by hostile state actors, the world has yet to see anything close to what will happen if a major military power unleashes an all-out cyber warfare campaign against an advanced industrial economy like the United States or Europe. Pry noted the worst-case scenarios for cyber attacks on American infrastructure envision millions of deaths.

One problem with discussing EMP attacks is that worst-case scenarios, like a nuclear device detonated at high altitude above the American heartland, get all the attention. It is easy to denigrate such scenarios as unthinkable, although we obviously have long-standing detailed plans to deal with even more unthinkable nuclear and biological attacks, and the EMP option would seem far more realistic to an assailant with very limited ability to deliver nuclear warheads over intercontinental distances.

Doomsday nationwide EMP attacks are not the only threat to consider, however. We like to think of the Internet as a vast amorphous blob of pulsing data, at once everywhere and nowhere, but in truth it has specific weak spots and hubs that could be hit with small weapons, perhaps well short of nuclear bombs. The damage from a “small” EMP attack on Wall Street or the tech hubs of the West Coast would run into trillions of dollars and could throw the entire U.S. economy into chaos. A glance at the latest grim urban traffic report suggests a small-scale EMP attack that affects just a portion of a single city could inflict thousands of casualties.

The Washington Times speculated on Wednesday that Trump’s executive order could be a step toward overcoming the resistance of private sector companies to spend money on hardening electric grids and computer networks against both natural disasters and sabotage.

The Washington Times also cited a congressional report from January that found hostile nations like China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea are working on developing EMP weapons and have incorporated such weapons into their military doctrines. The U.S. media has been hysterical about Russian espionage and information warfare for years but suddenly thinks President Trump is going overboard by taking the ultimate cyber threat seriously.

Sam Brownback, ambassador-at-large for International Religious Freedom, told a State Department press conference on Thursday he has received reports of U.S. citizens and legal residents imprisoned in China’s re-education camps for Muslims in Xinjiang province.

Brownback, who recently returned from a trip to Asia, spoke out against China’s “increasing aggression towards people of faith.”

“China is at war with faith, but it is a war they will not win,” he said.

Brownback called out Chinese acts of oppression against Muslims, Tibetan Buddhists, and Christians, placing particular emphasis on the “horrific conditions and abuses” in the Xinjiang internment camps where a million Muslims have been held. A number of the prisoners have reportedly died in captivity at what China outrageously describes as “boarding schools” or “vocational training camps.”

Brownback said he received new information about a man with American legal status held in the Xinjiang camps right before the press conference began.

“Just as I walked over here, I received another email from a gentleman in the United States whose father is still in Xinjiang who hasn’t – he’s not been able to reach him for months, 75-year-old man, doesn’t know whether – where he is and whether he’s still alive,” Brownback said.

“If I get verified, this gentleman that I just was reading the email about has legal status in the United States. Now, he’s not a U.S. citizen, but he had legal status being here, traveled back to Xinjiang after being here with his son in California, and then has not been heard from since,” he clarified later in the press conference.

Brownback said the State Department has also received reports about Kazakh, Kyrgyz, and Turkish nationals held in the camps. Most of the Muslims in Xinjiang belong to the Uighur minority, a Turkic ethnic group. Turkey is the only major Islamic power to object to China’s harsh treatment of its Muslim population.

The Trump administration has unquestionably been the most vocal and active defender of Xinjiang’s Muslims. Brownback said on Thursday that the possibility of level sanctions against Chinese officials under the Global Magnitsky Act is still on the table. Sanctioned individuals could include the top Communist Party official in Xinjiang, who played a leading role in the oppression of Tibet before he was put in charge of the Uighur situation.

China would react with fury to any such sanctions, especially if a high official of the Communist Party is targeted. The Chinese government dismisses all action on behalf of Xinjiang’s Muslims as unacceptable interference in its internal affairs.

“Global Magnitsky is handled by Treasury Department, and when people are ready to make announcements, they will,” he said.

The ambassador noted that Chinese officials have not responded to numerous requests by family members in other countries seeking information about missing relatives in Xinjiang. He described a frustrating encounter with Chinese representatives at the United Nations earlier in March:

They claimed at that time – and the story has been morphing over time of what is taking place in Xinjiang – at first they denied anything was happening, nothing’s going on here. And then later they said they were vocational training camps, and that’s what the individual was saying at this time, that these continue to be vocational training camps. To which I said, “I get and have lists of names, hundreds of names that are sent to me that people that can’t find their relatives. Would you please help me find them and tell their relatives where they are?” To which there was no response from the Chinese official.

CNN cited multiple State Department sources on Friday who said they are aware of multiple persons with American legal status held in the Xinjiang camps. One source said the number of such individuals is not large but could provide no additional details due to privacy concerns.

The State Department explained on Thursday that because China “does not recognize dual nationality,” it can be difficult to provide consular services to people with U.S. legal status in China, and they could be “subject to additional scrutiny and harassment.”

Brownback referenced a meeting Secretary of State Mike Pompeo held on Wednesday with a survivor of the Xinjiang camps and the relatives of people who are still incarcerated there. The Uighur survivor, Mihrigul Tursun, said she was separated from her children, held in an overcrowded cell, and tortured with beatings and electrocution. Other Muslim veterans of the camps said China confiscated their Qurans and forced them to violate Islamic dietary laws in an effort to “deprogram” them away from their religion.

“We’re working to convince the Chinese that this practice is abhorrent and ought to be stopped,” Pompeo said on Wednesday.

“China must release all those arbitrarily detained and end its repression,” Pompeo said online after his meeting with the Uighurs. “The world cannot afford China’s shameful hypocrisy toward Muslims. On one hand, China abuses more than a million Muslims at home, but on the other, it protects violent Islamic terrorist groups from sanctions at the U.N.”

The latter comment was a reference to China’s repeated protection of Jaish-e-Mohammad terrorist leader Masood Azhar against sanctions. Jaish-e-Mohammad is the Pakistan-based extremist organization that claimed responsibility for a major attack on Indian troops in the disputed Kashmir province in late February, an incident that brought India and Pakistan to the brink of war.

Rep. Rick Crawford (R-AR) said Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) turned the House Intelligence Committee into “a propaganda organ of the Democrat Party,” offering his remarks in a Friday interview on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Daily with host Alex Marlow.

Crawford said, “I’m sure people like Adam Schiff lay awake at night going, ‘What can we do next to make sure we can’t move past this? What do I have to do I do to perpetuate this Russia collusion hoax?'”

LISTEN:

Crawford said Democrats push the “collusion” narrative in pursuit of partisan political advantage in the lead-up to 2020’s presidential election.

“So that’s why they have to disrupt and redirect and do all these other kinds of things because they’ve got to keep this stuff in the headlines until 2020,” assessed Crawford. “So they’ve formulated a plan to make sure they can continue to keep this theory alive to hopefully propel a Democrat into the White House.”

Crawford added, “Rosenstein was at the center of all this, and they were saying, “President Trump better note fire Rosenstein, because if he does, we’re going to impeach him, and he better not fire Mueller.’ They were counting on Mueller and Rosenstein, who were going to save the republic from the evil Trump, and they were held up as paragons of virtue. They were the guys who were going to get it done because, ‘They’re the only ones we can trust.’ Rosenstein was part of it — in fact, he was pivotal — in this whole narrative, and now, all of a sudden, he’s standing there shoulder-to-shoulder with Barr. Now, are we to believe he’s compromised, as well? They’re trying to discredit him.”

Under Schiff’s chairmanship, added Crawford, the House Intelligence Committee operates as a partisan tool of the Democrat Party.

“The Intelligence Committee is supposed to be about protecting the country, and what Adam Schiff has turned it into, it’s an arm of the DCCC. It is a propaganda organ of the Democrat Party and what can we do to smear the president sufficiently to deny him a second term.”

All Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee, including Crawford, requested Schiff’s resignation on Thursday given Schiff’s involvement in advancing the “collusion” narrative.

Crawford said, “We unanimously expressed our discontent with the comments he’s made — that he’s never substantiated — [over] the two years that he has spent making false claims … and accusing the president of X, Y, and Z related to collusion, and there was a laundry list of quotes that I submitted for the record.”

Crawford added, “Basically, the letter is essentially saying, “We’ve lost faith in your ability to lead.’ This is basically a no-confidence letter, and we’re asking him to resign his position. Under his leadership, the Intelligence Committee is weaker and by extension the intelligence community we rely on for national security is weaker because of him. [There] is important stuff that we need to be doing and we have taken our eye off the ball because [Democrats] have been so narrowly focused on the Russia collusion thing that now we can’t get around to … the kind of proper oversight and interaction with our assets overseas, and even here at home with regard to cyber-security and things of that nature [because] we’re spending most of our time in ridiculous hearings trying to perpetuate this Russia narrative.”

Crawford concluded, We need to get back to the core mission of the committee. We’re basically asking him to resign because we think he has demonstrated poor leadership.”

Left-wing pop star Cher proposed that Robert Mueller should “resign” in protest because the full special counsel’s report has not been released yet.

“Robert Mueller Is [American] Hero,” Cher said. “I [Pray] HE RESIGNS IN PROTEST, BECAUSE OF WAY trump’s Holding On 2 His Report, By His Grotesque Teeth‼️”

“trumps,An Odious,Loathsome,Disgusting Repulsive Excuse 4 a Man.He’s a CHEAP CON MAN,WHO’S IN [Love] WITH A N.KOREAN DICTATOR,& [Kisses] THE ASSES OF 3 MORE.”

Robert Mueller Is 🇺🇸Hero.

I🙏🏻HE RESIGNS IN PROTEST, BECAUSE OF WAY trump’s Holding On 2 His Report,By His Grotesque Teeth‼️trumps,An Odious,Loathsome,Disgusting Repulsive Excuse 4 a Man.He’s a CHEAP CON MAN,WHO’S IN♥️WITH A N.KOREAN DICTATOR🙄,&💋💋💋THE ASSES OF 3 MORE — Cher (@cher) March 29, 2019

Of course, Robert Mueller has finished his report as the special counsel for the Department of Justice, so it’s not clear what a resignation would even mean.

Cher, like many in Hollywood, have been taking the Mueller report quite hard, as the report concludes that there was no collusion between Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and Russia. President Trump also will not be charged with obstruction of justice, a decision reached by Attorney General William Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.

In December, the “Just Like Jesse James” singer declared Trump was a “liar, thug, crook, and traitor.”

“He & His Family Are So In Bed With Russia……Putin Puts Mints On Their Pillows,” she said.

I Have No Problem With trump Having Extra Marital Affairs,

However The Women Should Have Gotten a LOT MOREὋὋὋὋ.

My Problem…He’s a Liar,Thug,

Crook,Traitor,& He’s Ruining My

With Russia……Putin Puts Mints On Their Pillows — Cher (@cher) December 14, 2018

Earlier this year, the 72-year-old called the president “Putin’s waterboy.”

“The Most DANGEROUS THREAT To America’s Safety Is The Russian Operative,Who Currently Occupies The White House. There’s a Special Building In The After Life For Putin’s Waterboy…..TRUMP TOWER HELL,” she exclaimed.


Left-wing pop star Cher proposed that Robert Mueller should “resign” in protest because the full special counsel’s report has not been released yet.

“Robert Mueller Is [American] Hero,” Cher said. “I [Pray] HE RESIGNS IN PROTEST, BECAUSE OF WAY trump’s Holding On 2 His Report, By His Grotesque Teeth‼️”

“trumps,An Odious,Loathsome,Disgusting Repulsive Excuse 4 a Man.He’s a CHEAP CON MAN,WHO’S IN [Love] WITH A N.KOREAN DICTATOR,& [Kisses] THE ASSES OF 3 MORE.”

Robert Mueller Is 🇺🇸Hero.

I🙏🏻HE RESIGNS IN PROTEST, BECAUSE OF WAY trump’s Holding On 2 His Report,By His Grotesque Teeth‼️trumps,An Odious,Loathsome,Disgusting Repulsive Excuse 4 a Man.He’s a CHEAP CON MAN,WHO’S IN♥️WITH A N.KOREAN DICTATOR🙄,&💋💋💋THE ASSES OF 3 MORE — Cher (@cher) March 29, 2019

Of course, Robert Mueller has finished his report as the special counsel for the Department of Justice, so it’s not clear what a resignation would even mean.

Cher, like many in Hollywood, have been taking the Mueller report quite hard, as the report concludes that there was no collusion between Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and Russia. President Trump also will not be charged with obstruction of justice, a decision reached by Attorney General William Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.

In December, the “Just Like Jesse James” singer declared Trump was a “liar, thug, crook, and traitor.”

“He & His Family Are So In Bed With Russia……Putin Puts Mints On Their Pillows,” she said.

I Have No Problem With trump Having Extra Marital Affairs,

In response to President Donald Trump calling Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) “pencil neck,” MSNBC’s Donny Deutsch on “Morning Joe” slammed the president’s appearance, calling him “one of the most repulsive physically human beings” he has ever seen.

“When he started with the ‘pencil neck’ Adam Schiff, it reminds me, and it’s just — sometimes we laugh. And I’ve said this before on the show, he’s just disgusting to look at,” Deutsch said Friday. “He’s obese. I wish we could put out that picture of him from behind, playing tennis or playing golf. He’s one of the [most] repulsive physically looking human I’ve ever seen. And yet — ”

Hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski interrupted Deutsch, chastising him for his remarks.

“OK, OK, Donny. No, no, no,” Scarborough said. “Let’s let him talk that way.”

“This is just not unnecessary,” Brzezinski added during the crosstalk.

Deutsch defended himself, saying, “Joe, but it’s important. That’s what a bully does. He makes fun of people’s physical imperfections. It’s ironic.”

Kim Foxx is under fire after all charges were dropped against the Empire star in connection to allegedly staging a hate crime against himself to boost his career. This week, Foxx’s office backpedaled on claims that the top prosecutor formally rescued herself from the case after Tina Tchen, the former chief of staff of former first lady Michelle Obama, pressured her to have the Smollett investigation transferred from the Chicago Police Department to the FBI.

A partial transcript is as follows:

INGRAHAM: What do you think about this? I mean, Rahm Emanuel, suddenly, has like put the brakes, Oh no, President Trump, go to baseball. Cutie.

YOO: First of all, I think a lot of Americans, myself included, are outraged by this, the fact that this fakes a hate crime. Look, I’m a minority, you’re a woman, what if were to be attacked legitimately, and now we’re going to be less believed by police and prosecutors because of the example of this guy. I think that’s terrible. I think a lot Americans realize something ought to be done. Second, this is why we have a U.S. Justice Department. Okay, so maybe they just spent a lot of time investigating President Trump to no good effect. But, now they actually exist to make sure there is no corruption going on in state government. If you look at the details of this case where Mrs. Obama’s chief of staff calls the prosecutor, Kim Foxx, and all of the sudden these machinations occur and then the case gets dropped. That is exactly what the Justice Department is supposed to be involved in — to make sure there is no corruption in state government. So, I hope that President Trump is right and that the FBI is starting an investigation to look into this.

INGRAHAM: What’s the potential criminal exposure here, both for Foxx and the state’s attorney office itself?

YOO: So, Foxx could be potentially liable for what’s called mail wire fraud of depriving citizens of their honest services, which if she is convicted, right? This is the standard law that is used to go after corrupt state officials. Suppose she got a bribe, suppose she was promised a fundraiser or who knows what kind of other influence to drop this case, the maximum sentence is 20 years in prison.

According to a recent report from Reveal News, Elon Musk’s Tesla left factory injuries off of official reports, to make its factories seem safer for workers than they really are.

Reveal news reports that electric car manufacturer Tesla failed to report a number of injuries at the Fremont, California factory recently. The report notes that Tesla’s security officer brought many of these issues to managers and even CEO Elon Musk, but when discussing the lack of yellow markings designating hazard areas, she was told “Elon does not like the color yellow.”

Reveal News writes:

Concerned about bone-crunching collisions and the lack of clearly marked pedestrian lanes at the Fremont, California, plant, the general assembly line’s then-lead safety professional went to her boss, who she said told her, “Elon does not like the color yellow.” Robots work on Model S cars in Tesla’s factory in Fremont, Calif., in 2015. One color that some of Tesla’s former safety experts wanted to see more of is yellow, the traditional hue of caution used to mark hazards. The melding of cutting-edge technology and world-saving vision is Tesla Inc.’s big draw. Many, including Justine White, the safety lead, went to work there inspired by Elon Musk, a CEO with star power and now a groundbreaking rocket in space.

But what many true Tesla believers found was that the company’s operation was not what they expected it to be:

What she and some of her colleagues found, they said, was a chaotic factory floor where style and speed trumped safety. Musk’s name often was invoked to justify shortcuts and shoot down concerns, they said. Under fire for mounting injuries, Tesla recently touted a sharp drop in its injury rate for 2017, which it says came down to meet the auto industry average of about 6.2 injuries per 100 workers. But things are not always as they seem at Tesla. An investigation by Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting found that Tesla has failed to report some of its serious injuries on legally mandated reports, making the company’s injury numbers look better than they actually are.

Tesla reportedly began marking injuries received at the factory as personal medical issues or claimed they were only minor issues that required first aid, but many injuries were quite serious:

Last April, Tarik Logan suffered debilitating headaches from the fumes of a toxic glue he had to use at the plant. He texted his mom: “I’m n hella pain foreal something ain’t right.” The searing pain became so unbearable he couldn’t work, and it plagued him for weeks. But Logan’s inhalation injury, as it was diagnosed, never made it onto the official injury logs that state and federal law requires companies to keep. Neither did reports from other factory workers of sprains, strains and repetitive stress injuries from piecing together Tesla’s sleek cars. Instead, company officials labeled the injuries personal medical issues or minor incidents requiring only first aid, according to internal company records obtained by Reveal. Undercounting injuries is one symptom of a more fundamental problem at Tesla: The company has put its manufacturing of electric cars above safety concerns, according to five former members of its environment, health and safety team who left the company last year. That, they said, has put workers unnecessarily in harm’s way.

In an email to Tesla director Sam Teller, White said that while she had worked under intense conditions in Kabul, Afghanistan; Fukushima during the radiation crisis; Monrovia during the Ebola crisis; and Ferguson during the riots, she could not sleep at night while working at Tesla due to the safety issues she had seen.

"Hi Sam. I worked at: – Kabul, Afghanistan

– Fukushima during the radiation crisis

– Monrovia during the Ebola crisis

– Ferguson during the riots "I must tell you that I can't sleep here at Tesla" $TSLA Safety Lead for General Assembly, Justine White." pic.twitter.com/HyHpFVrLg0 — Gavran (@ravenvanderrave) March 26, 2019

White told Reveal News: “Everything took a back seat to production. It’s just a matter of time before somebody gets killed.”

At a recent conference, former Facebook security chief Alex Stamos stated that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has “more data about what people want to do online than anyone else in the world.”

CNBC reports that speaking at the Washington Post’s technology and policy conference on Wednesday, former Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos explained how Mark Zuckerberg manages to make decisions and business moves that eventually prove profitable but seem like huge gambles initially. According to Stamos, Zuckerberg can do this as he can almost see into the future because the CEO is “sitting on more data about what people want to do online than anyone else in the world.”

Stamos cited the acquisitions of messaging service WhatsApp for $19 billion and photo-sharing service Instagram for $1 billion as examples of Zuckerberg’s ability to predict the next most popular platforms. Stamos stated that at the time of purchase, these were seen as moves “that people think are insane but turn out to be prophetic because he knows the direction the world is going.”

Stamos is correct that WhatsApp and Instagram have worked very well for Facebook, with Instagram boasting 1 billion active users per month and WhatsApp drawing 1.5 billion users per month. Stamos stated that more Silicon Valley companies need to work together in order to meet shared goals: “People at Morgan Stanley and Goldman (Sachs) hate each other but they understand their boats rise at the same time,” said Stamos. “In the Valley, you have personality driven conflict…and if CEO’s (in tech) snipe at others in keynotes…it’s unlikely for them to work well.”

Stamos added that as issues such as content moderation, regulation of political ads, and cybersecurity become hot topics amongst Washington, Silicon Valley companies will have to work together to deal with them.

It looks like “flopping” has made its way to college basketball again as the Oregon Ducks’ Ehab Amin flopped dramatically to the boards after the Virginia Cavs’ Mamadi Diakite merely gave him a stern look.

Of course, “flopping” has a long history in basketball and occurs when a player purposefully stumbles or falls in an effort to lull refs into thinking he was fouled by an opponent.

Now the Ducks’ Ehab Amin has joined the ranks of the ridiculous after flopping on Thursday night as the Ducks faced the Cavs, the Big Lead reported.

Amin had a bit of a tussle over the ball with the Cavs’ Mamadi Diakite after which Diakite leaned forward and gave Amin a very stern look forehead-to-forehead. In reply, Amin suddenly dropped to the floor as if Diakite had hit him.

Diakite’s face after Amin hit the boards is classic.

As it happens, both players got a technical over the incident. Diakite for initiating forehead to forehead contact and Amin was also given a sanction for the incident.

Ending illegal immigration to the United States is the top priority for Republican voters in terms of increasing the American quality of life, a new survey finds.

In the latest comprehensive survey conducted by Pew Research Center, about 65 percent of GOP voters said the highest priority of the Republican Party should be ending illegal immigration and reducing the illegal alien population currently living in the U.S.

Mass illegal and unchecked immigration to the country has stagnated U.S. wages for decades while redistributing the wealth of America’s working and middle class to higher income earners.

The Pew Research survey reveals Republican voters, by a majority, view illegal immigration as a burden to their quality of life that will impact future generations.

Nationwide, there are roughly 11 to 22 million illegal aliens living in the country. As Department of Homeland Security (DHS) data has revealed, once illegal aliens resettle in the U.S., the overwhelming majority are never deported.

In terms of wage stagnation, research by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has discovered that the country’s mass illegal and legal immigration policy — where more than 1.5 million foreign nationals are admitted every year — shifts about $500 billion in wages away from working and middle class Americans toward new arrivals and economic elites.

Mass immigration, whether legal or illegal, puts downward pressure on Americans’ wages, researchers have repeatedly noted.

Every one percent increase in the immigrant composition of an American workers’ occupation reduces their weekly wages by about 0.5 percent, researcher Steven Camarotta has found. This means the average native-born American worker today has their weekly wages reduced by perhaps 8.5 percent because of current legal immigration levels.

In a state like Florida, where immigrants make up about 25.4 percent of the labor force, American workers have their weekly wages reduced by perhaps more than 12.5 percent. In California, where immigrants make up 34 percent of the labor force, American workers’ weekly wages are reduced by potentially 17 percent.

Likewise, every one percent increase in the immigrant composition of low-skilled U.S. occupations reduces wages by about 0.8 percent. Should 15 percent of low-skilled jobs be held by foreign-born workers, it would reduce the wages of native-born American workers by perhaps 12 percent.

Meanwhile, Trump’s “Hire American” economy has increased blue collar and middle class wages by four percent in the last 12 months, a Goldman Sachs analysis finds. At this rate, Trump could deliver a historic 14 percent wage hike for more than 100 million blue collar and middle class Americans before the 2020 presidential election.

In 2017, the foreign-born population reached a record high of 44.5 million. The U.S. is on track to import about 15 million new foreign-born voters in the next two decades should current legal immigration levels continue. Those 15 million new foreign-born voters include about eight million who will arrive in the country through chain migration, where newly naturalized citizens can bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the country.

The fast-growing migrant rush over the U.S. border is collapsing border security and overwhelming the ability of border agents to process and protect migrants, DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said in a Thursday letter to all members of Congress.

“We face a system-wide meltdown … We are witnessing the real-time dissolution of the immigration system,” the head of the Department of Homeland Security wrote March 28 in a six-page letter. She added that she will soon ask for an emergency funding bill:

I will be working with the Office of Management and Budget to provide you additional details in the near future, but the situation is so dire we want to make notification to you now that we will require additional resources … to ensure immediate safety and care of individuals in our custody.

Her letter emphasized her concern for the aid and welfare of the migrants, and she minimized any mention of Americans’ concerns about the personal and financial costs imposed by the cartels’ trafficking of drugs into U.S. communities and of cheap labor into U.S. workplaces. She also did not mention the opposition by Congress and the business sector to legal reforms that would curb cheap-labor migration, such as the E-Verify system, which exposes employers who try to hire illegals. She wrote:

My greatest concern is for the children [brought by the migrants], who are put at high risk by this emergency and who are arriving sicker than ever before after travelling on the treacherous trek … a resource surge is needed throughout the system to ensure efficient throughput and proper care [of migrants] … including conducting [health and] welfare checks, preparing meals, and accounting for personal property.

Nielsen’s statement did include vague references to the harm caused by the migration to Americans:

We are grappling with a humanitarian and security catastrophe … The result is a dangerous and growing backlog of individuals in custody that has forced us to begin releasing large numbers of aliens … Without additional assistance, we will be forced to increase the releases of the single-adult population from ICE — the only population for which we can currently effectively enforce U.S. immigration laws.

But her letter includes far more appeals to help provide for the welfare and safety of the migrants who have triggered the crisis, including the statement that “our most urgent need is to increase [migrant] throughput to avoid threats to life and property.”

Once the migrants get through the border, they are free to take jobs at wages that are below the level sought by blue-collar Americans. But the migrants’ willingness to work service jobs for cheap is a financial and status boon for employers and upper-income Americans.

NEW – DHS Sec Kirstjen Nielsen is asking for immediate action from Congress to address a “dire situation” at the border including a request for new authority to send unaccompanied minors back to their home countries. “Now we face a system-wide meltdown,” she wrote in a letter. pic.twitter.com/NMocGkaXVS — Katherine Faulders (@KFaulders) March 28, 2019

On Monday, border commissioner Kevin McAleenan provided reporters with some details about the Central Americans’ rush into Americans’ society, jobs, and schools. The March inflow alone will include roughly 15,000 parents and 40,000 children in “family units” who will ask for asylum — and then will be released — plus roughly 35,000 single adults who will try to evade border officers, he said.

McAleenan pinned the blame on Congress and the judges who have jointly cut legal holes in the border fences by allowing migrants to stream into U.S. cities, jobs, and schools if they merely ask for asylum:

The increase in family units is a direct response to the vulnerabilities in our legal frameworks where migrants and smugglers know that they will be released and be allowed to stay in the U.S. indefinitely pending immigration proceedings that could be many years out. This is due to court orders that undermine the integrity of our immigration system. There is no questioning [about] why this is happening.

Current trends suggest that almost one million migrants — including perhaps 400,000 workers — will rationally grab Congress’s tacit invitation to migrate into the United States during 2019.

That migrant inflow augments the normal inflow of roughly 400,000 illegal migrants who sneak across the border, the overstay of several hundred thousand legal visitors and tourists, the arrival of roughly one million legal immigrants, and the arrival of at least one million new white-collar and blue-collar temporary visa-workers. All told, the federal government is expected to allow roughly three million additional legal or illegal foreign workers to flood the U.S. labor market in 2019, just as four million American youths begin looking for the well-paid careers they need to get married, buy houses, and raise families.

On Thursday, Trump displayed anger at Mexico and the Central American governments for not stopping their poor citizens from migrating into Americans’ rich and peaceful society.

Mexico is doing NOTHING to help stop the flow of illegal immigrants to our Country. They are all talk and no action. Likewise, Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador have taken our money for years, and do Nothing. The Dems don’t care, such BAD laws. May close the Southern Border! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 28, 2019

Trump also blamed the Democrats for repeatedly blocking his immigration reforms — yet GOP leaders and many GOP senators also did not try to push those reforms when they held the majority in the House and Senate.

The Trump reforms are strongly opposed by business donors who gain when the government imports more legal and illegal labor, more consumers, and more renters, even though most of the legal and illegal migrants will eventually support Democratic candidates.

We have a National Emergency at our Southern Border. The Dems refuse to do what they know is necessary – amend our immigration laws. Would immediately solve the problem! Mexico, with the strongest immigration laws in the World, refuses to help with illegal immigration & drugs! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 28, 2019

Despite Trump’s campaign promises, Trump’s deputies are not using all their authority to stop the inflow, said Jessica Vaughan, policy director at the Center for Immigration Studies.

For example, Nielsen, McAleenan, and other agency officials say young migrants cannot be repatriated until Congress changes a far-reaching 2008 law, she said. But that “TVPRA” law is narrow and only covers victims of “severe trafficking,” such as prostitutes who are under the lethal control of international criminal gangs, she said.

In contrast, many of the young migrants are not covered by the 2008 law because they are being smuggled willingly — often by coyotes working under contracts with their parents. Under Nielsen, DHS officials are sticking with the far-reaching, pro-migration interpretation set by officials working for former President Barack Obama, she said.

The cross-border flow of children and youths — dubbed “UACs” — is also being protected by a clause in the 2019 budget that makes it difficult for enforcement officials to detect and deport the foreign parents who pay coyotes to deliver their children to the U.S. border agents. The parents pay for the delivery because they know the border agencies will relay the young migrants to temporary shelters run by the Department of Health and Human Services. The parents then pick up their children at the shelters by offering to “sponsor” them until a later court hearing. The UAC-smuggling clause was demanded by Democratic negotiators and approved in February by the GOP negotiators.

The 2019 DHS spending bill provides $1.4 billion for the border wall – and also encourages migrants by promising aid, busses & legal advice/shields, plus favorable future media coverage & Dem cheerleading.

Nielsen’s statement did not blame Democrats but claimed instead Trump’s agencies and the pro-migration Democrats “have common cause.” She wrote:

We all want to enforce the laws of the United States, ensure a safe and orderly migrant flow, protect our communities, reduce the flow of drugs, facilitate legal trade and travel, secure our borders and support vulnerable populations.

In February 2018, Democratic senators united to block Trump’s “Four Pillars” immigration reforms. Their opposition was also joined by more than ten GOP senators.

The Washingon Post reported March 21:

Democrats say they are determined to counter what they view as Trump’s irresponsible fear­mongering over the security risks of the migrants and slow his push for a border wall. Experts have said the barrier would do little to stop the flow of Central Americans who seek to surrender to authorities in hopes of winning asylum protections. In their fight, Democrats have pressed administration officials to acknowledge there is no emergency. During a Senate oversight hearing this month, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) asserted that border crossings “are still at a historic low compared to other times in our nation’s history.”

Blumenthal then suggested that Congress pass a law to raise the inflow of foreign workers by repeating the industry-developed phrase: “fix our broken immigration system.” The Post reported:

“The Trump Administration is cooking the books to justify a vanity project that won’t keep Americans safe. The fact is we’re far closer to the lowest number of border apprehensions we’ve ever seen than the highest,” Blumenthal said in a statement. “I’ve long called for the Administration to step up and work with Congress to fix our broken immigration system and invest in strategic border security — but the Administration’s fraudulent fear-mongering does not work.”

Each year, roughly four million young Americans join the workforce after high school or university. The federal government then imports roughly 1.1 million legal immigrants, refreshes a resident population of roughly 1.5 million white-collar guest workers and roughly 500,000 blue-collar visa workers, and it also tolerates about eight million illegal workers.

In 2019 — because of catch-and-release rules mandated by Congress and the courts — the federal government also will likely release at least 350,000 migrant Central American laborers into the U.S. job market even as at least 500,000 more migrants sneak past U.S. border defenses or overstay their visas.

This federal policy of using legal and illegal migration to boost economic growth for investors shifts enormous wealth from young employees towards older investors by flooding the market with cheap white-collar graduates and blue-collar foreign labor.

This cheap labor economic policy forces Americans to compete even for low wage jobs, it widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids’ schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines millions of marginalized Americans, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.

But Trump’s “Hire American” policy has crimped the supply of new workers, so allowing blue-collar Americans to get a four percent wage increase in 2018.


The fast-growing migrant rush over the U.S. border is collapsing border security and overwhelming the ability of border agents to process and protect migrants, DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said in a Thursday letter to all members of Congress.

“We face a system-wide meltdown … We are witnessing the real-time dissolution of the immigration system,” the head of the Department of Homeland Security wrote March 28 in a six-page letter. She added that she will soon ask for an emergency funding bill:

I will be working with the Office of Management and Budget to provide you additional details in the near future, but the situation is so dire we want to make notification to you now that we will require additional resources … to ensure immediate safety and care of individuals in our custody.

Her letter emphasized her concern for the aid and welfare of the migrants, and she minimized any mention of Americans’ concerns about the personal and financial costs imposed by the cartels’ trafficking of drugs into U.S. communities and of cheap labor into U.S. workplaces. She also did not mention the opposition by Congress and the business sector to legal reforms that would curb cheap-labor migration, such as the E-Verify system, which exposes employers who try to hire illegals. She wrote:

My greatest concern is for the children [brought by the migrants], who are put at high risk by this emergency and who are arriving sicker than ever before after travelling on the treacherous trek … a resource surge is needed throughout the system to ensure efficient throughput and proper care [of migrants] … including conducting [health and] welfare checks, preparing meals, and accounting for personal property.

Nielsen’s statement did include vague references to the harm caused by the migration to Americans:

We are grappling with a humanitarian and security catastrophe … The result is a dangerous and growing backlog of individuals in custody that has forced us to begin releasing large numbers of aliens … Without additional assistance, we will be forced to increase the releases of the single-adult population from ICE — the only population for which we can currently effectively enforce U.S. immigration laws.

But her letter includes far more appeals to help provide for the welfare and safety of the migrants who have triggered the crisis, including the statement that “our most urgent need is to increase [migrant] throughput to avoid threats to life and property.”

Once the migrants get through the border, they are free to take jobs at wages that are below the level sought by blue-collar Americans. But the migrants’ willingness to work service jobs for cheap is a financial and status boon for employers and upper-income Americans.

NEW – DHS Sec Kirstjen Nielsen is asking for immediate action from Congress to address a “dire situation” at the border including a request for new authority to send unaccompanied minors back to their home countries. “Now we face a system-wide meltdown,” she wrote in a letter. pic.twitter.com/NMocGkaXVS — Katherine Faulders (@KFaulders) March 28, 2019

On Monday, border commissioner Kevin McAleenan provided reporters with some details about the Central Americans’ rush into Americans’ society, jobs, and schools. The March inflow alone will include roughly 15,000 parents and 40,000 children in “family units” who will ask for asylum — and then will be released — plus roughly 35,000 single adults who will try to evade border officers, he said.

McAleenan pinned the blame on Congress and the judges who have jointly cut legal holes in the border fences by allowing migrants to stream into U.S. cities, jobs, and schools if they merely ask for asylum:

The increase in family units is a direct response to the vulnerabilities in our legal frameworks where migrants and smugglers know that they will be released and be allowed to stay in the U.S. indefinitely pending immigration proceedings that could be many years out. This is due to court orders that undermine the integrity of our immigration system. There is no questioning [about] why this is happening.

Current trends suggest that almost one million migrants — including perhaps 400,000 workers — will rationally grab Congress’s tacit invitation to migrate into the United States during 2019.

That migrant inflow augments the normal inflow of roughly 400,000 illegal migrants who sneak across the border, the overstay of several hundred thousand legal visitors and tourists, the arrival of roughly one million legal immigrants, and the arrival of at least one million new white-collar and blue-collar temporary visa-workers. All told, the federal government is expected to allow roughly three million additional legal or illegal foreign workers to flood the U.S. labor market in 2019, just as four million American youths begin looking for the well-paid careers they need to get married, buy houses, and raise families.

On Thursday, Trump displayed anger at Mexico and the Central American governments for not stopping their poor citizens from migrating into Americans’ rich and peaceful society.

Mexico is doing NOTHING to help stop the flow of illegal immigrants to our Country. They are all talk and no action. Likewise, Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador have taken our money for years, and do Nothing. The Dems don’t care, such BAD laws. May close the Southern Border! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 28, 2019

Trump also blamed the Democrats for repeatedly blocking his immigration reforms — yet GOP leaders and many GOP senators also did not try to push those reforms when they held the majority in the House and Senate.

The Trump reforms are strongly opposed by business donors who gain when the government imports more legal and illegal labor, more consumers, and more renters, even though most of the legal and illegal migrants will eventually support Democratic candidates.

Border Patrol Agent Hector Garza told Fox News that Congress needs to “get serious and stop rewarding illegal immigration.” His comments follow one of the busiest weeks in Texas immigration history that saw nearly 1,700 migrants illegally cross the border in the Rio Grande Valley Sector in a single day.

“We have lost the ability to know who or what is coming across the border,” Agent Garza told Fox & Friends during an interview on Thursday morning. The agent spoke to Fox News in his capacity as Vice President of the National Border Patrol Council.

“If you live in a poor country like those in Central America and you make your way into the United States knowing that you are going to be released into the United States,” Garza stated, “why wouldn’t these people come? That’s why Congress needs to get serious about this — they need to change the laws so that people are not encouraged to come into the United States (illegally).”

Garza’s comments come during a week where Border Patrol agents in the Rio Grande Valley Sector apprehended nearly 1,700 migrants in a single day, Breitbart News reported. Border Patrol officials said the apprehensions represented the largest single-day total for the sector since 2014.

“We don’t know who or what is coming across because now our agents are having to process these people, transport them, feed them, care for them, and now we can’t even do our job of border security,” the veteran Border Patrol agent stated. “That’s unacceptable.”

Border Patrol officials reported that during the month of February, more than 66,000 migrants were apprehended after illegally crossing the border from Mexico. Officials are now predicting that more than 100,000 will be apprehended in March.

During a speech at the Texas-Mexico border near El Paso, U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin K. McAleenan said, “On Monday, we saw the highest total of apprehensions and encounters in over a decade, with 4,000 migrants either apprehended or encountered at Ports of Entry in a single day. That was Monday.”

“Yesterday, we broke the record again with 4,117,” the commissioner stated. “We are now on pace for over 100 thousand apprehensions and encounters with migrants in March, with 90 percent of those, 90 thousand people, crossing the border illegally between Ports of Entry. March will be the highest month since 2008. The arriving flows are made up primarily of Central American families and unaccompanied children.”

Garza explained the impact of new Border Patrol policies calling for the near-immediate release of most of the migrants that are currently being apprehended. “Out of those 100,000 that are going to be coming in during the month of March, 90 percent are being released into the community.” He said that many of those being released have violent criminal records.

“A lot of these people do commit dangerous crimes,” he explained. “A lot of these people do bring serious diseases into our communities.” He went on to say that agents have been faced with many diseases in the processing centers.

“Congress needs to stop playing politics,” Garza concluded. “They need to make sure that they pass laws and that they provide resources for Border Patrol agents so that we can prevent all of thes mayhem that is happening on the border.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — The number of migrant families and children entering the U.S. from Mexico is so high that Border Patrol is immediately releasing them instead of transferring them to the agency responsible for their release, forcing local governments to help coordinate their housing, meals and travel.

“We need to work toward a clean sweep,” Border Patrol Deputy Chief of Operations Richard Hudson said in a letter obtained by The Associated Press sent to sector chiefs Thursday. “This should be our daily battle rhythm.”

Agents are still doing medical screenings and criminal checks, but the decision means thousands of families will be released without first going through U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement, which manages their deportation cases.

The Del Rio and Rio Grande Valley sectors in Texas and the Yuma, Arizona, sector earlier announced that agents would begin to release families on their own recognizance. A Border Patrol official not authorized to speak on the matter said Wednesday that El Paso and San Diego planned on doing the same. Some sectors were not part of the change, including Tucson, Arizona and El Centro, California.

Families are typically released with notices to appear in immigration court due to legal restrictions on detaining them and lack of holding space. Until now, Customs and Border Protection has detained them briefly before turning them over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, generally within 72 hours, to be released pending the outcome of their immigration cases.

The move came as Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen wrote to Congress asking for emergency funding for humanitarian and operational needs, and the ability to detain families together as long as necessary to deport people faster.

“The volume of ‘vulnerable populations’ is unsustainable. Our system has been able to cope with high numbers in the past, but the composition of today’s flows makes them virtually unmanageable,” she wrote.

Arrests all along the southern border have skyrocketed in recent months. Border agents are on track to make 100,000 arrests and denials of entry at the southern border this month, over half of which are families with children. To manage the crush, U.S. Customs and Border Protection is reassigning 750 border inspectors from their usual duties at the ports of entry to help Border Patrol keep pace with arrivals in between ports of entry. The head of the agency held a press conference in El Paso on Wednesday to say the breaking point had arrived.

But federal lawmakers have fought over whether there is a “crisis” at the border, particularly amid President Donald Trump’s push for a border wall that he claimed will solve all the immigration problems. Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, Chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, said Thursday the evidence shows the immigration system is cracking under the strain.

“The sad reality is that we now have a virtual open border for any migrant who crosses with a minor, and our border security enforcement has been reduced to a mere speed bump for migrants on their path to long-term occupancy in the United States,” he said, adding border officers are being asked to perform an impossible task with no help from Congress.

And along the border, officials were working to manage the families that had been suddenly released. Yuma Mayor Douglas Nicholls said was city is working with various non-governmental organizations to make sure families released by the Border Patrol have temporary housing, food, medical care and help with traveling to their intended destinations.

Most immigrant families coming to the U.S. don’t plan on staying in the border towns they cross through, but rather to meet up with family throughout the country.

“Focusing on the humanitarian effort is the most important focus for the city, Nicholls.

The Yuma Sector has over the last two years seen an extraordinary spike in the number of immigrant families who turn themselves in. Yuma Deputy Chief Patrol Agent Carl E. Landrum said Thursday that agents have arrested 30,000 people in the relatively small sector since October 1.

The facility in Yuma has the capacity to temporarily hold 410 people. Until Thursday, ICE had been picking all of these families up and taking them to Phoenix and Tucson to be processed. But the numbers have swelled so much now that ICE doesn’t have enough resources to pick everybody up, so Border Patrol agents themselves are releasing families in Yuma.

“It is overwhelming us locally, as well as overwhelming the system nationally,” Landrum said.

“The sheer volume of family units crossing the border has overwhelmed ICE’s limited transportation resources; combined with a requirement to detain these individuals for no more than 20 days, the agency has no option but to expeditiously arrange for their release,” ICE spokeswoman Sarah Rodriguez said in a statement.

The agency makes “every attempt to coordinate the release of these individuals with NGOs that provide assistance with basic needs, but the heavy influx in recent months has inundated these organizations as well,” Rodriguez said.

Swanton Sector Border Patrol agents apprehended 10 migrants after they illegally crossed the Canadian border into New York. The apprehensions came in a series of disrupted human smuggling attempts.

Burke Station agents patrolling near Fort Covington, New York, came upon a group of seven men who illegally crossed the border from Canada into the U.S. All of the migrants allegedly admitted to Border Patrol agents that they had no documentation to be legally present in this country, according to information obtained from Swanton Sector Border Patrol officials.

Officials identified five of the migrants as Mexican nationals. One of the other men reported dual citizenship with Algeria and France, while the seventh migrant is a native of Spain.

The U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of New York will be filing charges against four of the men for illegal entry without documentation ( 8 USC 1325). Officials identified two of the others as previously deported illegal aliens. The U.S. Attorney is expected to file felony charges for illegal re-entry after removal (8 USC 1326). The seventh migrant will be processed administratively and turned over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) officers for expedited removal proceedings.

Later that same day, agents assigned to the Swanton Sector Tactical Communications Center notified agents in the field that three people were illegally crossing the border into the U.S. near Chateaugay, New York. Agents responded and quickly apprehended two of the migrants. The third migrant fled to avoid apprehension, officials reported.

The agents carried out a search and eventually apprehended the third migrant.

One of the migrants initially apprehended reported to be a Mexican national while the second is a native of Nicaragua. Agents turned all three men over to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for prosecution on immigration violations.

“It is through teamwork, intelligence and technology that our agents were able to apprehend these illegal aliens and bring them to justice,” Swanton Sector Acting Chief Patrol Agent William Maddocks said in a written statement. “I’m proud of the commitment of our agents as well as the staff at our Tactical Communications Center, and equally appreciative of the partnerships that we have with the U.S. Attorney’s Office, ICE and ERO.”

“It is through teamwork, intelligence and technology that our agents were able to apprehend these illegal aliens and bring them to justice,” Swanton Sector Acting Chief Patrol Agent William Maddocks said in a written statement. “I’m proud of the commitment of our agents as well as the staff at our Tactical Communications Center, and equally appreciative of the partnerships that we have with the U.S. Attorney’s Office, ICE and ERO.”

A young illegal alien has been sentenced to life in prison for brutally attacking, raping, and beating 17-year-old Nabra Hassanen to death in the sanctuary city of Fairfax County, Virginia.

Darwin Martinez Torres, a 22-year-old illegal alien from El Salvador, was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for murdering Hassanen in June of 2017. Last year, the illegal alien pleaded guilty to raping and murdering the teenage girl.

As Breitbart News reported at the time, Hassanen and a group of fellow Muslim teenagers were eating at a nearby McDonald’s when they left and started walking back to the All Dulles Area Muslim Society (ADAMS) Center. According to police, Torres started following the teenagers.

Soon after the teens noticed Torres, the illegal alien jumped a curb with his car and got out of his vehicle and started chasing the teens while wielding a baseball bat.

Torres was able to grab Hassanen and began beating her with the bat, before ultimately putting her in his car, driving to a neighboring county, raping and murdering her. The illegal alien took her body to a nearby pond and dumped her there for the authorities to later find.

Fairfax County became a sanctuary city last year, whereby local jails and law enforcement are prohibited from turning criminal illegal aliens over to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency for deportation.

For the past two years, the establishment media has buried Torres’ illegal alien status in reports. Associated Press and local media reports on the case, for example, called the illegal alien “Sterling man” in headlines, referring to the illegal alien’s Sterling, Virginia residence.

The Washington Post, similarly, failed to mention Torres’ illegal alien status, only mentioning once that he is from El Salvador.

Illegal immigration is draining red states like Alabama — with a small illegal alien population — of their congressional representation, Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL) says.

During testimony at a House Oversight and Reform Committee this week, Brooks said asking United States residents on the upcoming 2020 Census is necessary to know the number of illegal aliens living in the country and to ensure that congressional districts are drawn based on the number of American citizens, rather than entire populations, including citizens, noncitizens, and illegal aliens.

“I submit the inclusion of the citizenship question on the next census is not only common sense, it is a Constitutionally required,” Brooks said.

After the 2010 Census, illegal aliens were counted for reapportioning Congressional districts and electoral college votes. Hence, states that had fewer illegal aliens saw a shift of their political power to states that had more illegal aliens. [Emphasis added] Law-abiding states lost not only Congressional representation in Congress, they also lost electoral college votes that elect the president of the United States. I submit the citizenship power of citizens in low illegal alien count states was diluted as their Congressional seats and electoral college representation was disproportionately cut. [Emphasis added] Similarly, the counting of illegal aliens for reapportionment of political power purposes violates the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause by unconstitutionally diluting the representative and political power of citizens who live in low illegal alien population states. [Emphasis added]

As Breitbart News has reported, the counting of only American citizens to divide up congressional districts and electoral college votes would shift power away from the affluent, metropolitan coastal cities of the U.S. and towards middle America.

If congressional districts were set by the number of citizens, the overall average population needed per congressional seat could decrease to about 670,000 citizens per district. This would give a stronger advantage for states with small illegal alien populations to gain and keep their current number of congressional seats.

Counting Illegal Aliens in Congressional Districts Will Strip Red States of Representationhttps://t.co/B5yK3bpraU — John Binder 👽 (@JxhnBinder) September 11, 2018

For instance, if by only counting citizens, a state like Ohio, with few illegal aliens, could possibly gain a congressional seat, increasing the state’s total number of representatives to 17. Current projections suggest Ohio will lose a congressional seat.

In West Virginia, which is also slated to lose a congressional seat, the state could keep their three districts if the redistricting is counted by citizens. Indiana, as well, — with less than 180,000 noncitizen residents — would potentially increase its congressional seats from nine to ten if apportionment is based on the number of citizens in the state.

On the other hand, deep blue states with affluent coastal cities are set to make major gains in terms of congressional representation. California has an estimated three million illegal aliens, a total of about 5.3 million noncitizens, and a total population of about 39.5 million residents. Currently, California has 53 congressional seats, the most in the country.

If California’s congressional districts were set by the number of citizens in the state, it would potentially lose three to five congressional seats, leaving the state with about 48 to 50 seats.

“Congressional districts with lower percentages of citizens — because of higher illegal alien concentrations — grant their citizens an unequal representative power when compared to citizens in districts with higher percentages of citizens and lower percentages of illegal aliens,” Brooks said.

The U.S. Supreme Court is set to decide in the coming months the constitutionality of asking American residents their citizenship status on the 2020 Census.

Currently, the U.S. admits more than 1.5 million legal and illegal immigrants every year, with more than 70 percent coming to the country through the process known as “chain migration,” whereby newly naturalized citizens can bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the U.S. In the next 20 years, the current U.S. legal immigration system is on track to import roughly 15 million new foreign born voters. Between seven and eight million of those foreign born voters will arrive in the U.S. through chain migration.

A team of gunmen with the Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion (CJNG) forced three of their victims to kneel for questioning before their executions by firing squad in a crude show of force as they lay claim to yet another Mexican state. The cartel was recently submitted before the U.S. Department of State for classification as a foreign terrorist organization.

In a video recorded by CJNG and then spread through social media, a large team of gunmen can be seen surrounding three men during questioning. Two of the men reveal their names and claim they were kidnappers and extortionists. A third man said he was a street-level drug dealer with changing loyalties.

El poder de fuego del Cartel del @EPN y @osoriochong #CJNG acribilla a unos secuestradores que operaban en la capital del Estado Michoacano. Entre los ejecutados estaba el “Choco-flan” levantado por chapulín vende drogas. @TamaulipasCRojo @VigilantesV @vigilantehuaste pic.twitter.com/8pmIu1WlyC — México Código Rojo (@MexicoCodigoRo) March 29, 2019

The video was apparently recorded in Morelia, Michoacán, the capital of a coastal Mexican state that has seen extensive violence in recent years, despite the claims of Governor Silvano Aureoles Conejo that the region is safe. A top leader with Cartel Los Viagras previously recorded a video where he claimed he took money from Aureoles in exchange for helping win an election.

In the execution video, an unknown speaker claims the CJNG controls Morelia and they will target criminals who do not follow their rules. The video cuts to another scene where the victims are kneeling in front of a cartel firing squad. Moments later, hooded gunmen begin firing hundreds of rounds into the victims–who collapse in a cloud of dust.

The gunmen claim to belong to Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion, a criminal organization linked to a large portion of the violence in Mexico and recently named one of three cartels that two U.S. Congressmen seek to have labeled as foreign terrorist groups.

Editor’s Note: Breitbart News traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila, Nuevo León, and other areas to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.

McALLEN, Texas – Federal authorities arrested a top operator for Mexico’s Gulf Cartel in Roma, Texas. The Mexican national has a lengthy criminal history in the U.S. and is one of the main leaders of the cartel’s human smuggling network–earning him a spot on the bi-national most wanted list.

This week, U.S. Border Patrol agents arrested 36-year-old Andres “El Pause” Martinez Granados. Court records revealed that authorities charged Martinez Granados with illegal re-entry and took him before U.S. Magistrate Judge Peter Ormsby, who formally notified him of the charge and ordered that he be held without bond. In court, Martinez Granados requested a court-appointed attorney. Martinez Granados also has outstanding state court warrants filed by the Starr County Sheriff’s Office.

The man known as El Pause has prior human smuggling convictions and at least three prior deportations. Law enforcement sources in Mexico identified El Pause as a top Gulf Cartel operator who is considered a major player in the human smuggling operations for the criminal organization.

In June 2018, U.S. federal authorities and the Tamaulipas government launched a bi-national most wanted list called “Se Busca” where they outlined 10 of the top cartel bosses and operators responsible for most crimes along the border. Since the program launched, authorities have arrested seven out of the 10 targets. Granados is the only cartel operator on the list that was arrested in Texas.

Actor and National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) Image Awards host Anthony Anderson said he is happy that the “system worked” for Empire star Jussie Smollett, after prosecutors in Chicago abruptly dropped all charges against him over hoax hate crime against himself.

On Tuesday, the Cook County State Attorney’s Office dropped all charges against the 36-year-old, who was facing 16 separate felony counts related to filing a false report that he was assaulted by two men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs in downtown Chicago in late January.

The decision sparked widespread outrage from across the political spectrum, including from Chicago’s Democratic Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who denounced it as a “whitewash of justice.”

However, many of Smollett’s supporters have used the decision to exonerate him, with Black-ish star Anthony Anderson declaring he now hopes that Smollett will win an award at the upcoming awards ceremony for his performances on Empire.

“I hope to see him here,” Anderson told Variety. “I hope he wins. I’m happy for him that the system worked for him in his favor because the system isn’t always fair, especially for people of color.”

“So I’m glad it worked out for him,” he continued. “It’s not my place or any other person’s place to judge him or what not, but I’m glad [that] he’s nominated…I hope he wins because I’d be interested to hear his speech.”

What’s more? The National Association for the Advancement of Colored Persons (NAACP) initially blamed President Trump for Smollett’s hoax attack.

Elsewhere, Project 21, a national Black Leadership Network of conservatives, has demanded the NAACP to rescind its Image Award nomination for Jussie Smollet.

Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel blamed President Donald Trump in a press conference Thursday for the alleged hate hoax carried out by Empire Jussie Smollett, claiming that the president created a “toxic” and “vicious” cycle for which the star thought he could get away with the purportedly staged attack on himself.

“Look, I’ve always said from day one this is a Trump-free zone, the city of Chicago, and I mean it,” Emanuel told reporters. “Let me be really clear about something: The only reason Jussie Smollett thought he could take advantage of a hoax about a hate crime is for the environment, the toxic environment Donald Trump created.”

“This is a president who drew a moral equivalency between people who are trying to perpetuate bigotry and those who are trying to fight bigotry,” the mayor continued. “As somebody who started his own journey in politics fighting the neo-Nazis in Skokie and Marquette Park, President Trump should literally take his politics, move it aside.”

Prosecutors infuriated Emanuel and the Chicago Police Department this week when they abruptly dropped 16 felony counts that accused Smollett of making a false police report about being the target of the attack.

Investigators believe Smollett, who is black and gay, hired two brothers to stage the January attack in downtown Chicago and that Smollett hoped the attention would help advance his career. Police also allege that before the attack, Smollett sent a letter threatening himself to the Chicago television studio where Empire is shot. Smollett has repeatedly said the two masked men shouted slurs, wrapped a rope around his neck and poured a substance on him. He also told detectives that the attackers yelled that he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan, police said.

The mayor then accused the president of creating a “toxic, vicious cycle” wherein Smollett believed he could pull off the alleged racist and homophobic assault against himself. “The only reason Jussie Smollett thought he could get away with this hoax about a hate crime is because of the environment President Trump created,” Emanuel reaffirmed.

He then criticized the president’s response to the deadly Charlottesville protest in which he said there are “good people on both sides,” and suggested he not involve himself in the Smollett case.

Emanuel concluded his remarks by saying: “My recommendation to the president is good to opening day baseball, sit on the sideline, stay out of this. You created a toxic environment and all of us who are trying to make sure that we share a common set of values that embrace and welcome people of all walks of lives and backgrounds.”

The mayor’s remarks came as city officials ordered Smollett to pay $130,000 to cover the cost of the investigation into his report of a street attack that police say was staged.

A letter from the city’s legal department to Smollett and his attorneys said that figure covers overtime worked by more than two dozen detectives and officers who spent weeks looking into Smollett’s claim, including reviewing video and physical evidence and conducting interviews.

Those resources, the letter said, “could have been used for other investigations.”

Hours earlier, President Trump tweeted that the FBI and the Department of Justice would review the “outrageous” case, calling it an “embarrassment” to the country.

The FBI, which is investigating that letter, has declined to comment.

The Illinois Prosecutors Bar Association (IPBA) has condemned Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx for her handling of the Jussie Smollett case, calling her dismissal of the charges, and public statements, unethical and misleading.

The statement, issued on behalf of the IPBA’s 1,000 members, disputes Foxx’s claims that the case was handled in a typical fashion, and that it was a “deferred prosecution.” The statement reads, in part:

The events of the past few days regarding the Cook County State’s Attorney’s handling of the Jussie Smollett case is not condoned by the IPBA, nor is it representative of the honest ethical work prosecutors provide to the citizens of the State of Illinois on a daily basis. The manner in which this case was dismissed was abnormal and unfamiliar to those who practice law in criminal courthouses across the State. Prosecutors, defense attorneys, and judges alike do not recognize the arrangement Mr. Smollett received. Even more problematic, the State’s Attorney and her representatives have fundamentally misled the public on the law and circumstances surrounding the dismissal. … [T]he State’s Attorney kept the case within her office and thus never actually recused herself as a matter of law. Additionally, the Cook County State’s Attorney’s office falsely informed the public that the uncontested sealing of the criminal court case was “mandatory” under Illinois law. … The State’s Attorney not only declined to fight the sealing of this case in court, but then provided false information to the public regarding it. … Lastly, the State’s Attorney has claimed this arrangement is “available to all defendants” and “not a new or unusual practice.” There has even been an implication it was done in accordance with a statutory diversion program. These statements are plainly misleading and inaccurate.

The statement concludes: “Through the repeated misleading and deceptive statements to the public on Illinois law and circumstances surrounding the Smollett dismissal, the State’s Attorney has failed in her most fundamental ethical obligations to the public. The IPBA condemns these actions.”

This irregular arrangement was an affront to prosecutors across the State, the Chicago Police Department, victims of hate crimes, and the people of the City of Chicago and Cook County. We strongly encourage our members and the public to review the National District Attorneys Associations statement on prosecutorial best practices in high profile cases.

Read the full statement here.

Foxx was elected in 2016 after a super PAC supporting her campaign received $408,000 in contributions from billionaire left-wing mega-donor George Soros, who has funded “progressive” candidates for public prosecutorial offices ever since the eruption of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2014.

The statement concludes: “Through the repeated misleading and deceptive statements to the public on Illinois law and circumstances surrounding the Smollett dismissal, the State’s Attorney has failed in her most fundamental ethical obligations to the public. The IPBA condemns these actions.”

This irregular arrangement was an affront to prosecutors across the State, the Chicago Police Department, victims of hate crimes, and the people of the City of Chicago and Cook County. We strongly encourage our members and the public to review the National District Attorneys Associations statement on prosecutorial best practices in high profile cases.

Friday, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra (D) addressed criticisms of his state as being socialist and too highly taxed.

Becerra touted California as “doing a better job than most capitalists” in job creation and went on to praise California’s economy.

“As one state, we are now the fifth largest economy in the world. If we are socialists, we’re doing a better job than most capitalists when it comes to creating jobs. No one creates more jobs than we do,” Becerra argued.

He continued, “We’re number one in agriculture, just as we are in high tech. We’re number one in manufacturing, just as we are number one in clean energy. We graduate more people than anyone else in the country and people keep coming. We’re not 40 million because people hate us, we’re 40 million because we create good jobs. [It’s] not a bad place to live if you can water ski and ice ski on the same day, and so there are some things that make people come to California.”

American consumers regained their mojo in March, pushing the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment up to 98.4 from February’s 93.8.

Economists had expected the final read to match the preliminary reading for March of 97.8.

Consumers were more positive about both their present conditions and their outlook for the future, according to the survey.

The March gain was entirely due to households with incomes in the bottom two-thirds of the income distribution, according to the survey’s chief economist Richard Curtin. Sentiment among households in the top third of incomes fell slightly.

“Middle and lower income households more frequently reported income gains than last month, although income gains were still widespread among upper income households. Indeed, the last time a larger proportion of households reported income gains was in 1966,” Curtin said.

Lower expectations for inflation combined with rising incomes resulted in more favorable gains for real income expectations. All income groups voiced more favorable growth prospects for the overall economy.

Curtin pointed out that too few interviews were conducted following the summary release of the Mueller report to have any impact on the March data.

President Donald Trump’s approval rating jumped five points among likely voters since the report was delivered from Special Counsel Robert Mueller, according to the latest Rasmussen survey.

Trump is now up to a 50 percent approval rating according to Thursday’s results, up five points from his Monday and Friday rating of 45 percent.

This is the highest rating for Trump since he topped 50 percent in the beginning of March. He reached 51 percent approval around Thanksgiving of last year.

Rasmussen tracks daily results via 500 likely voters per night from telephone surveys as well as an online survey tool. The margin of sampling error for the full sample of 1,500 likely voters is +/- 2.5 percentage points.


President Donald Trump berated Democrats Thursday for causing a crisis on the Southern border by promising amnesty for illegal immigrants and making sure they take advantage of legal protections.

“Democrats want to pretend that there is no border crisis, for one simple reason. Because they have caused the border crisis,” Donald Trump said. “You know why else? Honestly? Because they want votes, and they don’t want to give us a win.”

Trump said that illegal immigrants and migrants crossing the border were met by lawyers who coached them to take advantage of the existing legal loopholes to get into the country.

“It’s a big, fat con job, folks,” he said. “It’s a big fat con job.”

The president commented on the ongoing crisis at the border during a rally with supporters in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

Trump recalled the border wall fight he had with Congress, noting that he agreed to call the wall whatever the Democrats wanted. “I said, ‘I will call it whatever the hell you want. Just give me the money to build it,'” he said. “Then they sort of got little cold feet, and now I call it the wall and I got the money anyway.”

He proudly touted his first presidential veto of the Congressional resolution to stop his declaration of a national emergency on the Southern border and thanked House Republicans for blocking Democrat attempts to override the veto. He also promised to travel to the Southern border soon to show off newly constructed physical barriers.

“We are building a wall, we will be finishing the wall, it is moving along rapidly,” Trump said.


Residents of the Somali capital of Mogadishu have experienced a wave of deadly suicide and car bomb attacks in recent days at the hands of the local al-Qaeda affiliate al-Shabaab, which killed at least 30 people in about one week, starting on March 21.

The Long War Journal (LWJ), a component of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), noted:

Last Saturday [March 23], Shabaab militants launched a suicide assault on the compound of Somali’s Labor and Public Works and Reconstruction ministries. A suicide car bombing and subsequent assault left 15 people dead, including Somalia’s deputy labor minister. Just two days prior to the suicide assault, a prominent civil engineer in Mogadishu was assassinated by a car bomb. While last Tuesday [March 26], a senior official with the Criminal Investigation Department of the Somali police was also assassinated by yet another car bomb in Mogadishu.

Between March 21 and Thursday alone, the East African jihadis killed at least 30 people in Mogadishu.

In a statement reportedly issued by the group in the wake of the latest attack on Thursday via its Shahada News Agency, the terrorists claimed they were targeting “agents and officers of the security apparatus,” referring to the African country’s intelligence agency, and “former representatives in parliament.”

On Thursday, al-Shabaab detonated a car bomb near a favored restaurant and hotel on one of the busiest roads in Mogadishu, killing at least 15 and wounding another 17.

Most of the people killed and wounded were reportedly dining at the restaurant at the time of the explosion.

Africa News pointed out:

Somalia’s capital Mogadishu has seen a deadly one week with sustained attack by insurgent group Al-Shabaab claiming the lives of close to thirty people. …From March 21 till today [Thursday], car bombs and Improvised Explosive Device, IED, attacks have been a regular feature except for 22nd and 24th. 23rd saw two different attacks.

Under U.S. President Donald Trump, the American military has launched a record number of airstrikes against the jihadi group — killing at least 225 terrorists already this year.

Last year, U.S. airstrikes in Somalia yielded the “third record high” annual death toll (326) of suspected al-Shabaab jihadis, the New York Times reported earlier this month, citing Pentagon data.

This year is on pace to eclipse the 2018 jihadi fatalities.

Trump’s executive order (EO) to intensify America’s air campaign against al-Shabaab, one of the largest al-Qaeda branches, ended former President Barack Obama-era restrictions.

Referring to Trump’s EO, Gen. Thomas Waldhauser, the head of U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM), declared in March 2017, “It’s very important and very helpful for us to have little more flexibility, a little bit more timeliness, in terms of [the] decision-making process and it’ll allow us to…counter ISIS [Islamic State] or in our case in Somalia, al-Shabaab.”

The Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) maintains a growing presence in Somalia, but its rival al-Shabaab remains the most dominant group in the region.

While acknowledging that the unprecedented number of U.S. strikes against al-Shabaab led to a slight decline in the overall attacks by the jihadis, the Mogadishu-based Hiraal Institute noted in November 2018 that the group is adapting to the “increasingly lethal air campaign.”

LWJ reports:

Shabaab has been resurgent in Somalia since losing ground to a combined African Union (AU) and Somali offensive in 2011. The jihadist group has slowly but methodically retaken several towns and villages that it lost in both central and southern Somalia – often after AU or Somali forces withdrew. In addition, Shabaab remains a potent threat against both African Union and Somali military bases in central and southern Somalia. It also retains the ability to strike within heavily fortified areas of Mogadishu, as seen time and time again.

Earlier this year, the AFRICOM commander warned about the lingering al-Shabaab threat in East Africa in an annual assessment of the U.S. military activities on the continent in the region.

“Since al-Shabaab’s first external attack in 2010, the group has killed hundreds through external operations, with the most lethal attacks occurring in Kenya and Uganda,” Gen. Waldhauser wrote.


A top leader of the North Africa-based al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), seeking to take advantage of protests against President Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s administration in Algeria, recently urged Muslims to “unite” to establish an Islamic emirate in the country, according to several reports.

Since February 22, hundreds of thousands of Algerians have taken to the streets in various cities across the North African country to rally against Bouteflika’s reportedly corrupt 20-year rule after he announced plans to run for a fifth term.

Seeking to take advantage of the chaos AQIM, considered one of the wealthiest al-Qaeda branches, has been egging on demonstrators.

Citing a report from earlier this month issued by the Long War Journal, a media component of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), the Barnabas Fund, a Christian watchdog group, noted this week:

A leading official of Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) has called on Muslims to “unite” to ensure Algeria is ruled according to Islam “alone” in a speech designed to take advantage of continuing street protests against the 20-year rule of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. The speech by Abu Ubaydah Yusuf al-Anabi, widely reported on social media on 9 and 10 March, describes the conditions that would lead to the formation of an Islamic emirate governed according to sharia law. He called Algerian Muslims to reject any regional or tribal identities and said that people are all the “sons of Islam”. He added that there is no difference between Arabs and foreigners as long as they share the same faith.

In 2015, the U.S. Department of State (DOS) deemed al-Anabi a terrorist, identifying him as the “leader of AQIM’s Council of Notables” who has also served as “AQIM’s Media Chief.”

The Long War Journal (LWJ) determined the al-Qaeda leader’s speech, titled, “Algeria…Getting Out From the Dark Tunnel,” is aimed at capitalizing on the ongoing protests, adding:

AQIM did not spark the protests, but the group seeks to inject its jihadist agenda into the story. …He begins his talk with references to the conditions that would lead to the formation of a proper Islamic emirate, which can only be headed by a religiously-minded figure who governs according to sharia. The “original infidel or apostate” cannot be a leader of Muslims, and must be removed from any position of authority.

He goes on to urge protestors make the removal of the Algerian government their “primary goal,” adding that the “end goal must be that Algeria is ruled” according to Islam and Islam “alone,” referring to al-Qaeda’s version of the religion.

“This means that AQIM seeks not only Bouteflika’s ouster, but removal of his entire system of governance,” LWJ added.

Al-Anabi accused the Algerian president of being “loyal to the Jews and the Christians.”

The anti-government protests intensified on Friday, according to several news outlets.

BBC revealed:

Hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets in Algeria to demand the resignation of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. Estimates say crowds in the capital, Algiers, reached a million. It is the sixth successive Friday of mass anti-government protests in the country. …For the moment, the protesters’ expectations are very high as they demand the departure of “everybody who has been associated with the regime”, but they do not offer an alternative.

Echoing the U.S. military, the FDD think-tank found in late 2017 that AQIM likely generates tens of millions of dollars annually through drug trafficking linked to violent Latin American cartels and other criminal activities.


Pope Francis told the people of Morocco he will visit them “as a pilgrim of peace and of fraternity” when he travels to the north African nation on Saturday.

The pope began his video-message to the Moroccans by wishing them peace in Arabic: “As-Salamu Alaikum!”, before going on to underscore key themes of his visit.

Thanking God, Moroccan King Mohammed VI, and the Moroccan authorities for making the trip possible, Francis told his hearers: “As Christians and Muslims we believe in God the Creator and Merciful One, who has created men and women and placed them on the earth so that they might live together as brothers and sisters, respecting each other’s diversity and helping each other in their need.”

“He has entrusted the earth – our common home – to them, to care for it responsibly and to preserve it for future generations,” the pontiff added.

According to a program released by the Vatican, during his two-day visit the pope will meet with King Mohammed VI, visit the institute for the training of imams, meet with migrants, and visit a local rural center of social services, among other things.

“It will be a joy for me to share these firm convictions with you directly at our meeting in Rabat,” the pope said in Thursday’s message. “This journey also offers me the invaluable occasion to visit the Christian community in Morocco and to encourage its progress.”

“I will meet migrants too, who represent an appeal to build together a more just and fraternal world,” he added.

According to the bishops of Rabat and Tangier, who are helping to organize the pope’s visit, the pontiff intends to focus on the situation of migrants when he visits the country.

More than 50 percent of the 27,000 Catholics living in Morocco are immigrants, with many of them coming from Sub-Saharan Africa looking for work or educational opportunities. Assisted by local parishes, many of these hope to be able to see the pope during his trip.

“Dear Moroccan friends,” Francis concludes, “I already express my heartfelt thanks for your welcome, and above all for your prayers; and I assure you of my own prayers for you and for your dear country.”

Jeff King, president of International Christian Concern, told Breitbart News that Islamists murdered 70,000 Christians in Nigeria over the last 20 years. He joined Thursday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight with host Rebecca Mansour and special guest host Dylan Gwinn.

“We don’t always get the press,” said King of many news media outlets’ disinterest in persecution of Christians. “It is absolutely the case [that Christians are the most persecuted faith].”

LISTEN:



King added, “A lot of people don’t know that … in Nigeria, probably 70,000 Christians have been murdered in the last 20 years by Islamists, and that’s just scratching the surface. It’s going on all over. There’s a spectrum to the oppression.”

On March 16, Breitbart News reported of Nigerian Muslim militants killing 120 Christians over a three-week period, saying, “The recent death toll of Christians in Nigeria has reached 120 with this week’s slaughter of more than 50 by Fulani Muslim militants in the Kaduna state of Nigeria, the Christian Post reported.”

Breitbart News Rome Bureau Chief Thomas Williams contrasted “mainstream media” coverage of the mass murder of Christians by Islamists in Nigeria with the mass murder of Muslims at a New Zealand mosque by a white racial nationalist:

Political leaders and public figures were falling over themselves this weekend to condemn the mosque attacks in New Zealand, while dozens of Christians were slaughtered by Muslims in Nigeria to the sound of crickets. … Without exception, the mainstream media gave top billing to the shootings, with newspapers carrying the story on their front pages and television news channels leading off their broadcasts with the story. The bizarre aspect of the coverage was not, in fact, the attention paid to a heinous crime committed in New Zealand, but the absolute silence surrounding the simultaneous massacre of scores of Christians by Muslim militants in Africa.

Last Monday, Dede Laugesen, director of Save the Persecuted Christians, told Breitbart News that “anti-Christian bias” across America’s “mainstream media” drives news organizations to downplay the mass murder of Christians by Islamic terrorist groups.

Laugesen described a “narrative” being pushed by “mainstream media” in America:

People don’t believe that Christians can be persecuted, that they could be slaughtered. Here in the United States, we just have a different sense of who Christians are, but out in the greater world, Christians are viewed as a threat to control and power. What you have operating in Nigeria, which is Africa’s most populous country — 200 million people living there with 50 percent Christians, 50 percent Muslims — you have two of the world’s most dangerous terrorist groups operating — Fulani militants and Boko Haram, now affiliated with ISIS Islamic State in West Africa — and they are driven by radical sharia supremacist ideology, seeking to spread shariah across the entire country of Nigeria.

Islamic terrorist movements, concluded Laugesen, are pursuing an ethnic cleansing strategy against Christians in Nigeria and across Africa.

“The long-term strategy is to clear the Christians from the land and to take the resources underneath them” assessed Laugesen. “There are valuable metals and stones in northern Nigeria that can be mined for quite bit of income, and that will only further be able to fund the caliphate that both of these groups is determined to establish in the ungoverned territories of Nigeria and the Lake Chad region.”

Pope Francis prayed publicly for the Christians massacred recently in Nigeria and Mali as the Vatican celebrated a day of remembrance for martyred missionaries Sunday.

After his weekly Angelus prayer in Saint Peter’s Square, the Pope told the thousands of pilgrims that “remembering the modern-day Calvary of our brothers and sisters persecuted or killed for their faith in Jesus is a duty of gratitude for the whole Church.”

“Let us for the many victims of the latest inhuman attacks in Nigeria and Mali,” Francis said. “May the Lord receive these victims, heal the wounded, console their families, and convert cruel hearts.”

As Breitbart News reported, Muslim militants slaughtered over 120 Christians in just three weeks in central Nigeria, looting and burning dozens of homes and churches. The Barnabas Fund, a Christian watchdog group, later corrected the number, noting that more than 300 Christians had in fact been slain in the Islamists’ “killing spree.”

In Mali, jihadists of Nusrat al-Islam, a militant organization formed by a merger of Islamists including the Saharan branch of Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, AQIM, stormed an army base last Sunday, killing 16 Malian soldiers and burning the base.

“Today we celebrate a day in memory of the missionary martyrs,” the pope said Sunday. “During 2018, throughout the world, numerous bishops, priests, nuns, and lay faithful suffered violence and forty missionaries were killed, almost twice as many as the previous year.”

“Remembering this modern-day Calvary of our brothers and sisters persecuted or killed because of their faith in Jesus is a duty of gratitude for the whole Church,” Francis added, “but also an incentive to courageously bear witness to our faith and our hope in Him who on the Cross has forever conquered hatred and violence with his love.”

Christians are the most persecuted religious group in the world, a fact routinely ignored or under-covered by the mainstream media. Most people do not realize how widespread the persecution is or that 75 percent of the victims of religious persecution around the world are Christians.

Nearly 300 million Christians around the world face severe persecution, which takes the form of executions, rapes, and other forms of violence, as well as harassment, threats to employment and personal livelihood, and social ostracization. This shows no signs of abating but, on the contrary, is increasing in many parts of the world.

Christian persecution in India, for example, was up by 57 percent in the first two months of 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018, while twelve Christian churches were desecrated in France in the course of one week.

This media bias against Christian persecution was poignantly illustrated earlier this month when media gave around-the-clock coverage to the New Zealand mosque shootings while completely passing over the slaughter of Christians in Africa, which claimed six times as many victims.

Google has expressed its regret over a “minor glitch” that caused the value of the Ghanaian currency, the cedi, to drop significantly.

CNN reports that a recent glitch in Google’s currency conversion rates system shocked many Ghanaian citizens. The Ghanaian currency, the cedi, has been performing poorly for some time and fell to a record low against the dollar in February with a total depreciation of 8.6 percent this year. So citizens were surprised on Marchi 15 when they logged onto Google to discover that the value of the cedi had increased by 300 percent in one day and was trading at a rate of 22.72 to one U.S. dollar.

The increased figure was apparently the result of an issue with Google’s currency conversion system for which the company has apologized. In a letter to Ghana’s Ministry of Finance, Google explained the issue with Google’s head of Public Policy & Government Relations, West and Francophone Africa, Titi Akinsanmi, writing:

We are aware of the issue of inaccurate conversions for Ghanaian Cedi currency on Friday the 15th of March. This was caused by a minor glitch that was quickly fixed. We always aim to provide people with the most relevant, useful information to help them to make the right decisions. But sometimes there are temporary issues that can cause people to have undesired experiences, like the one this past Friday. This was regrettable.

The ministry of finance noted that both Nigeria and Pakistan have suffered similar errors from Google’s currency converter; a Google spokesperson noted that the error in Ghana was rectified within an hour and that the Nigerian issue was also resolved in a quick and timely manner. However, it is extremely worrying that Silicon Valley tech firms now have the ability to greatly influence the value of a currency in other countries simply by changing a few figures in their system.

Currently, Google shows a rate of 5.23 cedis to one US dollar.


Boko Haram militants killed at least 23 Chadian soldiers on Thursday in what appears to be the latest deadly attack by the Islamic caliphate, Reuters reported Friday.

Chadian security forces close to the agency confirmed that the attack took place in the town of Dangdala, near the banks of Lake Chad. The assailants reportedly crossed the border from Niger before attacking a team of Chadian soldiers at around 1:25 a.m. At least 23 people have died, making it the deadliest Boko Haram attack in Chad to date.

The Chadian soldiers were part of a U.S.-trained West African military force tasked with eradicating Boko Haram, a Nigerian terrorist organization attempting to create an Islamic caliphate across West Africa.

About 30,000 people have been killed and a further two million have been displaced since Boko Haram began its initial insurgency in Nigeria nearly 10 years ago. Its activities have since spread to neighboring countries including Chad, Niger, and Cameroon.

In 2017, regional governments established the five-nation Sahel Force of Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger, However, Boko Haram still controls large swathes of territory, and regularly launch attacks against Christian communities and those who do not adhere to their form of Sunni Islam.

Just this week, the group launched an attack in a Christian-majority town in northeast Nigeria, leaving an unknown number of casualties and sending residents fleeing for the surrounding mountains. Christians make up a slight majority (51.3 percent) of Nigeria’s overall population and are concentrated primarily in the south, while Muslims comprise of 45 percent of the population and live principally in the north and middle belt.

The United States military may have committed lethal “war crimes” against “numerous” civilians, including children, as it ramped up its airstrike campaign against the al-Qaeda affiliate al-Shabaab in Somalia under President Donald Trump’s watch, the human rights group Amnesty International claimed on Wednesday, echoing allegations by the terrorist group and some news outlets.

U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) maintained that its airstrikes only target al-Shabaab, stressing that American military operations have killed no civilians. The terrorist group and Amnesty insist that the American airstrikes, carried out by manned aircraft and drones, have indeed killed civilians.

Brian Castner, the senior crisis adviser on arms and military operations at Amnesty International, declared:

The civilian death toll [14] we’ve uncovered in just a handful [five] of strikes suggests the shroud of secrecy surrounding the US role in Somalia’s war is actually a smokescreen for impunity. Our findings directly contradict the US military’s mantra of zero civilian casualties in Somalia. That claim seems all the more fanciful when you consider the USA has tripled its air strikes across the country since 2016, outstripping their strikes in Libya and Yemen combined.

In a report titled The Hidden US War in Somalia, Amnesty alleged that five of the more than 100 bombs airdropped on Somalian jihadis in the past two years killed 14 civilians and wounded eight others, including women and children.

The human rights group reported:

Amnesty International uncovered compelling evidence that US air strikes killed a total of 14 civilians and injured eight more, in five attacks that may have violated international humanitarian law and could, in some cases, constitute war crimes. Reports of more civilian casualties from other strikes could not be sufficiently corroborated for inclusion in the report.

Amnesty reportedly relied on eyewitness testimony, satellite images, and other photographs to reach its conclusion.

“US forces are known to have carried out a further 76 air strikes in Somalia during the period Amnesty International examined, as well as 24 in the first two months of 2019, so the civilian death toll may well be much higher,” it added.

Earlier this month, the New York Times (NYT) recently acknowledged that it could not independently verify claims that U.S. airstrikes in Somalia killed civilians, noting that al-Shabaab “claims regularly that civilians are also killed.”

Amnesty attributed the civilian fatalities in part to the proliferation of U.S. airstrikes in Somalia after commander-in-chief Trump signed an Executive Order (EO) declaring parts of the African country an “area of active hostilities”.

“US forces carried out 34 strikes in Somalia in the last nine months of 2017 – more than in the entire five years from 2012 to 2016. This increased again in 2018, to 47 strikes; and there have already been 24 in the first two months of 2019 alone,” the human rights group emphasized.

Soon after Trump took office, the U.S. military intensified its air campaign against the ruthless al-Shabaab jihadis, killing more than 200 terrorists from the outfit this year alone.

Trump’s executive order to ramp up airstrikes against al-Shabaab, one of the largest al-Qaeda branches, ended former President Barack Obama-era restrictions.

“It’s very important and very helpful for us to have little more flexibility, a little bit more timeliness, in terms of [the] decision-making process and it’ll allow us to give — in fact, counter ISIS or in our case in Somalia, al-Shabaab,” Gen. Thomas Waldhauser, the AFRICOM chief, proclaimed in March 2017, referring to Trump’s EO.

Nevertheless, an unnamed retired American Brig. Gen. allegedly told Amnesty International that Trump’s order “lessened the burden on the US military to guarantee that civilians will not be killed in air strikes.”

Amnesty added:

Worryingly, the General also believes that the Executive Order widened the net of potential targets to include virtually any adult male living in villages sympathetic to Al-Shabaab and seen in proximity to known fighters. Such a broad targeting mandate would violate international humanitarian law and lead to unlawful killing of civilians.

The Mogadishu-based Hiraal Institute acknowledged in November 2018 that the unprecedented number of strikes against al-Shabaab led to a slight decline in the overall attacks by the jihadis. However, the researchers noted that the group is adapting to the “increasingly lethal air campaign.”

U.S. airstrikes in Somalia in 2018 yielded the “third record high” annual death toll (326) of suspected al-Shabaab jihadis, NYT learned from Pentagon data.

The pace of strikes so far in 2019 — which have already killed 225 terrorists — is on pace to eclipse last year’s record.

“The US government must carry out impartial, thorough investigations into credible evidence its rapidly escalating air strikes in Somalia have killed numerous civilians, Amnesty International said in a new report today,” Amnesty declared.


U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration pledged $500,000 in “rapid response non-lethal aid” to the United Nations-brokered Government of National Accord (GNA) in chaos-ridden Libya soon after the breakaway administration consolidated its control of two-thirds of the North African nation.

The funding, which complements the $30 million in ongoing security aid to the GNA, is intended to “bolster security and address current threats,” the U.S. Embassy in Libya declared in a press release issued Tuesday, citing deadly political rivalries between forces loyal to the internationally recognized government and warlord Gen. Khalifa Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA) as well as the ongoing menace posed by jihadi groups like the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL).

U.S. Embassy officials explained in a press release issued Tuesday:

The United States pledged $500,000 USD in rapid-response non-lethal assistance in support of Ministry of Interior efforts to strengthen the capacity of the [GNA’s] Tripoli Security Directorate [forces]. This new assistance complements the United States’ $30 million USD in ongoing security assistance in support of Government of National Accord priorities, including projects to provide training to the Tripoli Security Directorate, help implement international standards at key airports, improve Libya’s border security management capability, clear unexploded ordinance in Sirte, bolster security sector reform, and build coordination between relevant actors ahead of elections.

The American embassy’s announcement came as Gen. Thomas Waldhauser, the top U.S. commander in Africa, and American Amb. Peter Bodde traveled to Tripoli on Tuesday to meet with senior GNA officials including PM Sarraj.

“We reiterated United States support for Libya as a unified, secure, and prosperous state under a government that can serve the Libyan people,” the American Embassy noted, later adding, “We will not tolerate spoilers to the political process.”

Additional U.S. aid for Libya came at a critical point in the conflict that has been plaguing the North African country since the NATO-backed removal of dictator Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.

The U.S.-backed ouster of the dictator plunged Libya into political and security mayhem that has allowed jihadi groups like the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) and al-Qaeda to entrench themselves while rival militias loyal to Haftar and the GNA compete for power and influence in the country. Both Haftar and the GNA have fought against the jihadi forces in Libya.

Propped up by Russia, France, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and neighboring Egyp, strongman Gen. Haftar, the head of the Tobruk-based breakaway government’s LNA, strengthened his hands and further undermined the U.S.-backed GNA by seizing more territory in southern Libya, including some that once belonged to the U.N.-backed administration led by Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj.

The strongman general’s recent push into southwestern Libya left the warlord in control of two-thirds of the country, including most border crossings and the majority of onshore oil fields.

Haftar is the top rival of the internationally recognized Serraj administration based in Tripoli, which does not have any official forces of its own. The prospect of the Haftar moving in on Tripoli has triggered concerns of an all-out war between the two sides.

Citing unnamed diplomats, Reuters noted, “Haftar has not said whether he wants to march on Tripoli. But he has left some troops from the southern campaign in central Libya to build up pressure on Serraj to agree on a power-sharing deal which would make him official army commander.”

Russian-backed Haftar is now reportedly seeking to seize the coastal city of Sirte, located just a few hundred miles from the shores NATO’s southern flank.

Although the U.S.-led coalition and local forces have downgraded the so-called caliphate in Iraq and Syria to a hamlet of tents, ISIS remains a threat in and beyond the Middle East, including Libya where the group is reportedly trying to regroup.

The U.S. Embassy noted:

We thanked Prime Minister al-Sarraj and Minister [of Interior Fathi] Bashaga for Libya’s strong partnership in combating ISIS and other UN-designated terrorist groups, and stressed the importance of avoiding further conflict that would enable terrorism and increase social and economic hardships.

Soon after taking office, President Trump declared that his administration’s involvement in stabilizing Libya would be limited to combating ISIS.

Under Trump, the United States military has sporadically targeted Islamic terrorists in Libya with airstrikes.

Gen. Waldhauser and independent experts have expressed concerns that Russia’s support for the warlord Haftar could undermine U.S. interests in the North African nation.

At the end of February, Haftar and Serraj agreed to hold democratic elections by the end of 2019.

“The only lasting solution for Libya is to overcome its political impasse,” the U.S. Embassy noted, expressing support for the U.N.’s efforts to bring both sides to the negotiating table.

Last year, Haftar and Serraj failed to keep their pledge to hold elections by December 2018.

“A major military push south by the Libyan strongman Marshal Khalifa Haftar has left him in the ascendant, and possibly able with international backing to dictate the terms of a future Libyan political settlement, including presidential and parliamentary elections,” the Guardian reported on March 11.


Boko Haram terrorists attacked a Christian-majority town in northeast Nigeria Monday night, leaving an unknown number of casualties and sending residents fleeing for the surrounding mountains.

Muslim extremists of the Boko Haram terror group stormed Michika, in Adamawa state, killing “many people” as they looted houses, fired shots, bombed a bank, and set buildings on fire, according to reports by area residents to local media.

One attack eyewitness said he personally knew four people who were killed.

“I can confirm to you that many people were killed last night and many were injured as well,” said a man named Bala. “I may not know all of those who lost their lives but I am sure of four persons whom I know personally, that were killed in the attack.”

“My aunt’s husband and their daughter were killed. I also know of a retired soldier and local businessman that were killed in front of their houses,” he said.

This was the second attack on the town in as many months; Boko Haram militants attacked Michika and four other towns in February, reportedly killing women, children, and elderly people.

During the attacks on the towns of Michika, Madagali, Shuwa, Gulak, and Bazza, the terrorists reportedly shouted the jihadist slogan “Allahu Akbar (God is greater).”

Adamawa State Police spokesman Othman Abubakar said he could not confirm the casualties from Monday’s assault but said that security agents had restored order in the village, which Boko Haram had seized in September 2014 and held until Nigerian troops recaptured it four months later.

Mathew Favandzaer, chairman of the Local Government Council, confirmed the attack, adding that the numbers of casualties and displaced persons were as yet unknown.

Monday’s attack on Michika came ahead of the supplementary governorship election on March 23, one of 14 local governments to do so. Last Thursday, Boko Haram militants torched a Christian church building in neighboring Borno state, killing one person and abducting two women.

The jihadists also launched attacks in southern Borno state on February 2, February 7, and February 21, during which they assaulted members of Church of the Brethren and burned 26 houses. During one of the attacks, militants abducted a seven-year-old boy who has not been heard from since.

Christians make up a slight majority (51.3 percent) of Nigeria’s population and are concentrated primarily in the south, while Muslims make up 45 percent of the population and reside principally in the north and middle belt.

Attacks by Boko Haram are not the only source of violent persecution for Nigeria’s Christians, as Muslim Fulani militants in the middle belt have massacred well over a hundred Christians in the last several weeks. Despite the elevated numbers of casualties and brutality of the religiously motivated assaults, mainstream media have been strangely silent about them.

In its 2019 World Watch List of countries where it is hardest to be a Christian, Open Doors, a watchdog group for Christian persecution, ranked Nigeria number 12.

Increased attacks on Christian communities by Hausa-Fulani Islamic militant herdsmen “claimed the lives of hundreds of believers during the reporting period, and scores of villages and churches were burned to the ground,” Open Doors said.

Muslim Fulani militants killed nine more Christians in Nigeria’s Middle Belt over the weekend, the latest strike in a string of lethal, religiously motivated attacks.

The governor of Kaduna state, Nasir El-Rufai, confirmed that the assault in the Sanga local government area had claimed at least nine lives, adding to the death toll of 120 Christians massacred in central Nigeria since February.

“The security agencies have so far recovered nine corpses, including children,” El-Rufai said. “The attackers also burnt several houses in the village. The government condemns this attack on the lives and security of citizens and appeals to our communities to resist those who do not want peace.”

A week ago, the Fulani jihadists, who have become a greater threat to Nigerian Christians than the Islamist terror group Boko Haram, raided the villages of Inkirimi, Dogonnoma, and Ungwan Gora in the Kajuru Local Government Area, destroying 143 homes, killing 52 people, and wounding dozens more.

From June 2015 to June 2018, Fulani militants “killed 8,800 Christians and other non-Muslims,” Nigeria’s Daily Post reported last year. During that same period, terrorists torched “not less than 1,000″ churches and other places of worship.

Despite the severity of these massacres, they went virtually unreported by international media.

Governor El-Rufai has vowed that the government, security agencies, and religious institutions will work towards creating “sustainable peace.”

“In this moment of grief, we must come together to defeat the machinations of those who have no notion of respect for the lives of others,” El-Rufai said.

“Violence has left an unacceptable toll of death and injury, loss of livelihoods, pain and fear. We must overcome this by respecting our common humanity, settling differences peacefully and promptly reporting threats and suspicions to the appropriate authorities. Evil will never triumph over our common humanity,” he said.

When mainstream media have reported on the slaughter of Christians in central Nigeria, they have downplayed the religious nature of the killings, preferring to attribute the violence to “ethnic tensions,” a “battle for land and resources,” or even “climate change.”

Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari, who is himself of the Fulani ethnic group, has encouraged this narrative, minimizing the importance of religion in the conflict.

Two local Catholic bishops, however, along with other Christian leaders, have insisted in calling out the violence for what it is: a “clear agenda for Islamizing the Nigerian Middle Belt” by using armed Fulani jihadists.

One of the bishops, Matthew Ishaya Audu of Lafia, said last year that the ongoing attacks are not random or economically motivated, but purposefully target Christians.

“They want to strike Christians,” Bishop Audu said, “and the government does nothing to stop them, because President Buhari is also of the Fulani ethnic group.”

Other observers agree that the attacks form part of a larger plan to eliminate Christians from the area.

“The killings are becoming no longer herder and farmer clashes” but a “deliberate attempt to conquer and occupy the land of the people’s ancestral heritage,” said Dr. Soja Bewarang, while denouncing an attack on a Bible school that trained Christian missionaries in Gana-Ropp village.

Reverend Gideon Para-Mallam, of the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students in Jos, said that the violence is part of a pattern, an emerging agenda, which represents “another Boko Haram in disguise.”

The targeted nature of the attacks in central Nigeria is indicative, Para-Mallam said, “because Plateau state is the epicenter of Christianity.”

President Buhari condemned the most recent violence and the “ethnic and religious bigotry” in a statement Saturday. He stressed, however, that all “communities involved” must find a “lasting solution.”

“[The] lack of cooperation by those involved might frustrate government’s efforts towards finding a lasting solution, especially if those efforts are politicized,” Buhari said. “If the people resist government’s efforts to hold the perpetrators and their sponsors accountable, it would be very difficult to bring the violence to a permanent end.”

In its 2018 report, the independent United States Commission for International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) determined that Nigeria should be designated as a “country of particular concern,” or CPC, a term for governments “that engage in or tolerate systematic, ongoing, egregious violations of religious freedom.”

The USCIRF has designated Nigeria a CPC every year since 2009.

Political leaders and public figures were falling over themselves this weekend to condemn the mosque attacks in New Zealand, while dozens of Christians were slaughtered by Muslims in Nigeria to the sound of crickets.

The mosque attacks were indeed a horrific affair and worthy of universal condemnation. Presidents, prime ministers, royalty, and religious leaders rushed to extend their condolences to victims and their families — as well they should — while decrying the hate that purportedly motivated the shootings.

Without exception, the mainstream media gave top billing to the shootings, with newspapers carrying the story on their front pages and television news channels leading off their broadcasts with the story.

The bizarre aspect of the coverage was not, in fact, the attention paid to a heinous crime committed in New Zealand, but the absolute silence surrounding the simultaneous massacre of scores of Christians by Muslim militants in Africa.

As Breitbart News alone reported among major news outlets, Fulani jihadists racked up a death toll of over 120 Christians over the past three weeks in central Nigeria, employing machetes and gunfire to slaughter men, women, and children, burning down over 140 houses, destroying property, and spreading terror.

The New York Times did not place this story on the front page; in fact, they did not cover it at all. Apparently, when assessing “all the news that’s fit to print,” the massacre of African Christians did not measure up. The same can be said for the Washington Post, the Chicago Tribune, the Detroit Free Press, the LA Times, and every other major paper in the United States.

The news shows from the three major television channels did not mention the story, and nor did CNN or MSNBC.

There are several possible explanations for this remarkable silence, and none of them is good.

Since, in point of fact, Muslim radicals kill Christians around the world with alarming frequency, it is probable that one more slaughter did not seem particularly newsworthy to the decision-makers at major news outlets. Muslims being killed, on the other hand, may strike many as newsworthy precisely because it is so rare.

A second motive for the media silence around the massacre of Christians in Nigeria may be geo-political and racial. New Zealand is a first-world country where such things are not supposed to happen, whereas many people still consider Africa to be a backwards place where brutal killings are par for the course.

Moreover, the slaughter of black Christians in Africa may not enkindle rage among westerners the way that the murder of white and brown Muslims in New Zealand would.

Finally, the story simply does not play to the political agenda that many mainstream media would like to advance. How much mileage can be gained from Muslims murdering Christians, when Christians in America are often seen as an obstacle to the “progress” desired by liberals? The left sees Christians in the United States as part of the problem and seeks to undermine their credibility and influence at every turn rather than emboldening them.

Anti-Christian bias has been rightly called “the last acceptable prejudice,” one that few bother condemning.

“No one much cares about offending Christians,” wrote the coalition of African-American pastors in an essay last Tuesday. “In fact, mocking, belittling, and blaspheming Christianity is becoming a bit of a trend in our culture. Anti-Christian bigotry truly is the last acceptable prejudice.”

“The hypocrisy on display is astounding,” the pastors continued. “Christianity is the dominant religion of our country. It is the foundation of our government and morality. And yet, Christians are treated as fair game for mockery and insult.”

Christians are by far the most persecuted religious group in the world, but the mainstream media routinely ignore this fact as if it were unimportant or uninteresting. As a result, many people do not even realize how widespread the persecution is or that 75 percent of the victims of religious persecution around the world are Christians.

Whatever the reason — or reasons — for the media silence surrounding the most recent massacres of Christians in Nigeria as well as numerous other such events, it should give right-thinking people pause.

By all means, the lethal shootings of dozens of Muslims in New Zealand is a massive story and merits extensive coverage. But it only stands to reason that similar coverage should be devoted to the slaughter of Christians.

For the moment, it serves as a poignant reminder that a double standard is at work when it comes to news coverage, and that it is Christians who inevitably draw the short straw.

Sea-Eye, a non-governmental organisation (NGO) which ferried migrants to Europe, has claimed that despite a three-week search off the coast of Libya, they were unable to find a single migrant to “rescue” before returning to port in Mallorca.

The Alan Kurdi migrant ferry, named after the young boy of the same name who drowned and washed ashore in 2015 during the height of the migrant crisis, returned to Palma de Mallorca after three weeks at sea looking for migrants but finding none, Mallorca Zeitung reports.

Dominik Reisinger, mission leader on the vessel described the three-week trip as a success, saying, “It was a successful mission, we were there, we were well prepared, if there had been an assignment, we would have been there and could have helped people. Fortunately, it was not necessary.”

The weather on the Mediterranean was described as particularly fierce during the three weeks, with seven-metre tall waves.

While one radio distress call was received by the crew off the coast of the Italian island of Lampedusa, their offer to help was not replied to. “We hope that in these weather conditions nobody was on a dinghy at sea, which would have been deadly,” Reisinger said.

Salvini’s Border Control Migrant Policy Reduces Arrivals by 95 Percent https://t.co/07ltiUu62i — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 29, 2019

Since the tough border policies of Italy’s populist Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Matteo Salvini were enacted last year, the number of migrants from Libya has massively dwindled. In the month of January, the number was down 95 percent compared to 2018.

The stricter border controls, which have included a refusal to allow migrant “rescue” NGOs to dock in Italian ports, have led to many other organisations, including Doctors Without Borders (MSF), giving up their ferry operations entirely.

Even those who run migrant reception centres have slammed the previous open border policy of the former Italian government: last month, the head of the country’s largest migrant reception centre Francesco Magnano came out against open borders ideology, saying it had “created slums scattered throughout the country.”

“In our country, there are 600,000 denials. People who have lost not only the right to reception, but have lost their status, they are zombies who live in our country,” he added.

The recent death toll of Christians in Nigeria has reached 120 with this week’s slaughter of more than 50 by Fulani Muslim militants in the Kaduna state of Nigeria, the Christian Post reported.

The Fulani jihadists, who have become a greater threat to Nigerian Christians than the Islamist terror group Boko Haram, stormed the villages of Inkirimi, Dogonnoma, and Ungwan Gora in the Kajuru Local Government Area last Monday, destroying 143 homes, killing 52 people, and wounding dozens more.

The assailants reportedly split into three groups, the first of which fired upon the people, the second set fire to buildings, and the third chased down people fleeing from the scene. Victims of the assault included women and children.

Monday’s incident followed an attack the day before in the Ungwan Barde village in Kajuru, where 17 Christians were killed and dozens of homes were burned.

In the first week of March, Muslim extremists massacred more than 30 Christians in Karamar village, setting fire to several houses and a church. The terrorists reportedly shot at families trying to escape the fire, killing 32.

The spate of recent attacks against communities has taken place within the predominantly Christian Adara chiefdom of southern Kaduna.

The governor of Kaduna state, Nasir El-Rufai, has imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew on the Kajuru Local Government Area to try to contain the violence.

In late February, militants attacked the Maro village, killing 38 Christians and torching homes as well as a Christian church.

The Christian Post reported that Fulani militants killed thousands of Christians in 2018 alone in what many are calling a Christian genocide in Nigeria’s Middle Belt.

Last December, a leading Anglican bishop in Nigeria, Dr. Benjamin Argak Kwashi, said that the Muslim Fulani militants represent the number one terrorist threat facing Christians in Nigeria.

“The government is able to provide protection [to the Christians], but what’s obvious to everybody is that the government is unwilling,” Kwashi told Breitbart News.

“The Fulani herdsmen are a bigger threat,” Kwashi added. “Boko Haram operates in the northeast and scantily moves into other areas, but the Fulani herdsmen are widespread. They’re everywhere now. So the Fulani are a bigger threat.”

The crisis facing aviation giant Boeing intensified this week as 737 Max 8 aircraft were grounded around the world following the deadly Ethiopian Airlines crash on Sunday. President Donald Trump issued an emergency order following suit on Wednesday afternoon as they were banned by almost every other country in the world.

The New York Times previously tallied up the grounding orders and concluded the United States was “basically alone” in allowing 737 Max 8s to fly after Canada grounded them on Wednesday morning. Canadian authorities said they would not even allow 737 Max 8 and Max 9 planes from the U.S. to pass through their airspace. Canada’s transport minister said the decision was made based on “new data” about the Ethiopian Airlines crash received on Wednesday morning.

The European Union and India grounded 737 Max aircraft on Tuesday.

China, which owns about a quarter of the operational 737 Max aircraft in the world, suspended flights on Monday, an announcement that apparently inspired carriers across Asia and the Middle East to follow suit. NPR on Tuesday published a list of 29 countries that have grounded the Boeing planes, a list that did not yet include Canada.

The Canadian and Chinese grounding orders were especially momentous because their civil aviation authorities rarely disagree with the American Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Chinese officials reportedly consulted with the FAA before making their decision, but then declared the American agency is having “difficulty making a decision, so we took the lead.” China indicated it will allow 737 Max flights to resume once Boeing provides sufficient safety guarantees.

The FAA stated on Tuesday that will continue to “review extensively all available data and aggregate safety performance from operators and pilots of the Boeing 737 Max.”

“Thus far, our review shows no systemic performance issues and provides no basis to order grounding the aircraft. Nor have other civil aviation authorities provided data to us that would warrant action,” the FAA wrote.

The agency promised to take “immediate and appropriate action” if any defects in the aircraft are identified.

On Monday, the FAA ordered a series of design changes to the 737 Max line based on the investigation of a previous crash in Indonesia, including revised safety checklists, new training requirements, and “changes to the software that forces the nose down in certain situations to prevent an aerodynamic stall.” The order will go into effect next month. Boeing representatives said a “software enhancement” to the flight controls is already under development.

The Hill reported on Tuesday that while Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg gave President Donald Trump assurances the company’s planes are safe to fly, and the administration wanted to give the FAA more time to review the situation, pressure for immediate action is mounting both internationally and domestically:

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas,) chairman of a Senate subcommittee on aviation and space, urged the U.S. government to ground the planes “until the FAA confirms the safety of these aircraft & their passengers.” “Further investigation may reveal that mechanical issues were not the cause, but until that time, our first priority must be the safety of the flying public,” he said in a tweet. “I intend to hold a hearing to investigate these crashes, determine their contributing factors, and ensure that the United States aviation industry remains the safest in the world.” Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) called on Elwell to ground the aircraft, while Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said American Airlines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines should voluntarily suspend use of the 737 Max models “until we have answers.” Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) were among those who called on the FAA to ground the planes pending an investigation into the causes of recent crashes.

Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat running for her party’s presidential nomination in 2020, made it personal, political, and conspiratorial by demanding congressional hearings on “whether an administration that famously refused to stand up to Saudi Arabia to protect foreign arms sales has once again put lives at risk for the same reason.”

The Hill queried the top U.S. carriers that employ Boeing planes and found Southwest Airlines has 34 of the 737 Max 8 planes, American Airlines has 24, and United Airlines has 14 Max 9 models. All three of the airlines said they are working closely with the FAA and Boeing and are confident the planes are safe to fly.

The two major flight attendants’ unions, on the other hand, expressed concerns about the safety of the planes and demanded FAA action to restore public confidence. One of the unions implied its members might not be willing to fly on 737 Max 8 planes if their concerns are not addressed.

The Dallas Morning News reported on Tuesday that pilots have filed numerous complaints about the Max 8 with the FAA. The article cited five complaints filed in October and November related to the autopilot system, several of them noting that the plane suddenly nosed down on its own. Investigators believe this type of behavior was a factor in both the Indonesian and Ethiopian crashes, although the investigations are still ongoing.

Ethiopian Airlines CEO Tewolde GebreMariam told CNN on Tuesday that his pilot encountered “difficulties with the flight control of the airplane” and requested permission to return to base before the crash, which killed all 157 people aboard. GebreMariam stated Ethiopian Airlines pilots were given additional training on the 737 Max 8 after the Indonesian crash in October.

According to the Dallas Morning News, a total of 18 carriers have expressed confidence in the safety of the planes and decided not to voluntarily ground them.


NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) – French President Emmanuel Macron will be in Kenya today in the first visit by a French leader since the East African nation’s independence in 1963.

This is the latest stop in Macron’s Africa tour, followed by Ethiopia and Djibouti, focusing on investment and security in a region of increasing strategic importance.

The French leader is attending a U.N. environmental meeting and One Planet Summit in Kenya’s capital, Nairobi, and meeting with President Uhuru Kenyatta.

Macron’s office says that Kenya is the only African nation to reach the goal of making renewable energy 75 percent of its energy mix.

The office also notes the ongoing threat to Kenya from extremism. Al-Shabab is in neighboring Somalia.

French business leaders are also traveling with Macron. Kenya is East Africa’s commercial hub.


Spiralling knife, drugs, and gang crime in London has been leading many concerned Somali parents to send their teenage offspring, who grew up in Britain, away to Africa for their own safety.

With 50 to 70 per cent of members of the Somali community in Islington, north London, “directly affected” by knife violence and ‘county lines’ drugs crime, mothers who arrived from the troubled African country during the 1990s told the Observer they felt they had “no choice” but to send their children away from an increasingly dangerous UK.

Sadia Ali, the treasurer of the Islington Somalia Forum and a mother of seven, said she sent her 15-year-old son away to live in the country she once fled as a result of the threat of local gang violence in London, telling the newspaper that many other families in the area have done likewise for their children’s safety.

“Hundreds of youngsters have been taken to Somalia, Somaliland and Kenya, some taken all the way to the rural areas. Parents feel they have no choice if they want their son to be safe,” she said.

Rakhia Ismail, Islington deputy mayor, added: “Sending them away has become the only way they can be safer. This issue of safety has been repeatedly raised by the community but nobody has listened. So many children have gone abroad. Two weeks ago, there was a stabbing and a child was taken back home two days later.”

Yusuf Sheikh Omar, a research associate at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in London, lamented last week that “knife crime in British cities has brought many young Somalis into the criminal justice system and claimed several lives”.

Sweden So Violent, Migrants Consider Moving Back To War-Zone Homelands https://t.co/JfBY8cpM2v pic.twitter.com/4PV6xucibb — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 23, 2016

Young Somali men in Western nations are growing up “alienated and at risk of violence”, warned Dr Omar in the Conversation, where he argued that the demographic was “particularly susceptible to criminality and Islamist extremism” as a result of issues such as “marginalisation, poverty, unemployment, racism, identity crises [and] Islamophobia”.

Illustrating how Somalia is an increasingly safe country for migrants to return to, Breitbart London reported on the government of Denmark refusing to rule out deporting illegal Somali immigrants back to their homeland in the Horn of Africa. The Danish government asserts it is now becoming safe enough for them to return.

Danish Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen raised the issue after a meeting with his Somali counterpart in Egypt recently. In December, the country’s migration minister Inger Støjberg had urged individuals from Somalia whose “life and health are no longer at risk” in their homelands to “return home and [help] rebuild the country”.


Gen. Khalifa Haftar, the head of the breakaway government’s Libyan National Army (LNA), gained control of two-thirds of Libya – including most border crossings and the majority of onshore oil fields – after sweeping through the North African country’s southern region in recent weeks, the Guardian reported on Monday.

The Guardian article came on the same day that the U.N.-brokered Government of National Accord (GNA) based in Tripoli declared a state of emergency in the north-central coastal city of Sirte following reports of LNA forces marching towards the region.

In a statement calling on all fighters loyal to the GNA to duty against Haftar’s forces, the Sirte Protection Force (SPF) affiliated with the U.N.-brokered government declared, “Any attack on the city will mean a declaration of war and its consequences will turn into a disaster.”

Haftar’s army reportedly claimed that their forces advanced on territory near Sirte, but the SPF issued a statement on Sunday denying the allegation, the Libyan Express notes.

The strongman general has surfaced as the top leader of the Tobruk-based breakaway government in eastern Libya making him the top rival of the internationally recognized administration of Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj from the GNA.

With the alleged support of neighboring Egypt, Russia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and France, Gen. Haftar’s LNA — accused of war crimes by human rights groups — has conquered most of eastern and southern Libya, including the country’s largest oil field.

The Guardian reports:

A major military push south by the Libyan strongman Marshal Khalifa Haftar has left him in the ascendant, and possibly able with international backing to dictate the terms of a future Libyan political settlement, including presidential and parliamentary elections. …The push into the Fezzan region has left Haftar in control of two-thirds of the country, most border crossings and many key oil installations, including the large oil fields in the Murzuk basin.

Haftar’s push into Fezzan — which borders Algeria and Niger — means the strongman general “now controls the majority of Libya’s onshore oil fields,” Peter Millett, the former U.K. ambassador to Libya, indicated to the Guardian.

At the beginning of the month, LNA troops declared that it had captured Libya’s southern border with Algeria, claiming they now control all Libyan borders except one to the west that lies along Tunisia’s international boundary, according to the Libyan Express.

Libya has descended into chaos since the NATO-backed overthrow of dictator Muammar Qaddafi in 2011.

The United States has sporadically targeted Libya-based terrorists with airstrikes. U.S. military officials have expressed concern about Russian support for Gen. Haftar.

On February 27, Russian-allied Haftar and U.S.-back PM Serraj met in Abu Dhabi in what appeared to be a new attempt to end the nearly eight-year-old conflict that has rendered the country a fertile ground for human traffickers and jihadis like the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) and al-Qaeda.

Without setting a specific date, the Libyan leaders also agreed to hold democratic elections this year and lift the block on oil production at the al-Sharra field, Libya’s largest field that is now under LNA control.

Last year, both leaders failed to keep their pledge to hold elections by December 2018.

“It remains to be seen whether Haftar is truly committed to a democratic process, or whether, as some fear, he will prepare to take further territory in the west before a final push to Tripoli, the headquarters of resistance to him,” the Guardian notes.

Acknowledging that Libyans fear a showdown between the LNA and Pro-GNA troops, Reuters noted on Monday:

[Gen. Haftar] has not said whether he wants to march on Tripoli, which would dramatically escalate tensions. But his Libyan National Army (LNA) has hinted heavily that it might do so — if Haftar is not recognised as the country’s overall military commander, his aim since he began assembling the force in 2014.

It appears Haftar’ LNA is on the move to seize more territory, undeterred.


The U.S. military steadily ramped up airstrikes against the Somalian terrorist group al-Shabaab over the past year, shifting its focus away from the dying Islamic State to al-Qaeda’s most feral ally with relatively little media attention.

The U.S. military announced on Monday that an airstrike on Sunday killed 35 al-Shabaab fighters, bring the total number of terrorists killed in 2019 to over 180. According to the U.S. Africa Command, the strike targeted al-Shabaab fighters as they were “transitioning between locations in a rural area” and inflicted no civilian casualties.

The battle against al-Shabaab was escalated slowly but constantly, rather than surging into a “shock and awe” campaign, so it has not been covered in the press as a major shift in American strategic focus.

The New York Times tallied up the numbers on Monday and noted U.S. officials are talking about the air campaign in Somalia as the one military intervention that definitely will not be scaled back over the coming year:

A surge in American airstrikes over the last four months of 2018 pushed the annual death toll of suspected al-Shabab fighters in Somalia to the third record high in three years. Last year, the strikes killed 326 people in 47 disclosed attacks, Defense Department data show. And so far this year, the intensity is on a pace to eclipse the 2018 record. During January and February, the United States Africa Command reported killing 225 people in 24 strikes in Somalia. Double-digit death tolls are becoming routine, including a bloody five-day stretch in late February in which the military disclosed that it had killed 35, 20 and 26 people in three separate attacks.

Former National Security Council analyst Brittany Brown, now chief of staff for the International Crisis Group, told the NYT that American should pay more attention to the “massive war” developing largely on “autopilot” in Somalia, but another NSC veteran, Luke Hartig, offered the opposite analysis that U.S. commanders are trying to hit al-Shabaab hard and fast while they have the opportunity.

If Hartig’s take is correct, the U.S. is presumably hoping to wreck al-Shabaab’s infrastructure and degrade its manpower so that local allied forces can turn the tide against the terrorist group. Al-Shabaab is relatively small but vicious and nimble, and it prefers hit-and-run attacks such as the recent Mogadishu hotel massacre to Islamic State-style territorial conquest. The New York Times article quotes American commanders who reported success at goading al-Shabaab fighters into open combat by building outposts in their territory and then wiping out the attackers with heavy air support.

The Times noted President Donald Trump significantly escalated U.S. activities in Somalia, removing restrictions imposed by his predecessor President Barack Obama and authorizing U.S. commanders to order air strikes more quickly.

The Times article strives to portray the escalation as a war spiraling out of control with no clear strategic imperative, but details in the article such as the aforementioned outpost baiting strategy, deeper diplomatic engagement with the Somali government, and the growing strength of Somali security forces suggest a more coherent plan of action has been laid out, not just for Somalia but around the world as al-Qaeda eclipses ISIS as the major terrorist threat.

Foreign Policy last week quoted human rights activists who worried U.S. airstrikes are making the humanitarian crisis in Somali worse by driving people from their homes, although they could offer little in the way of evidence that American bombs are having a significantly more negative effect than the general violence between al-Shabaab forces, Somali government troops, and assorted peacekeepers. The one displaced Somali quoted in the article specifically stated she fled from her home due to fighting between al-Shabaab and government forces last summer, mentioning ten relatives were killed by “airstrikes” but providing no supporting details.

U.S. officials insist the airstrikes have targeted al-Shabaab positions with minimal collateral damage, and there have been few documented allegations to the contrary. The UK Guardian claimed in January 2018 that “dozens of civilians have been killed and wounded in Somalia as U.S.-led airstrikes against Islamist militants increase to unprecedented levels,” but the piece offers little evidence that most of these civilians were killed by American warplanes, only that American planes were “involved” in a few battles where civilian deaths were reported. Toward the end of the article, the Guardian noted that the United Nations blamed Kenyan forces for most of the confirmed civilian deaths in Somalia.

The Somali government accused the U.N. of interfering in its internal affairs in January because it felt the U.N. was excessively critical of civilian casualties incurred during Somali security operations against al-Shabaab. The U.N. reported heavy civilian casualties and widespread suffering in Somalia long before U.S. bombing began to increase, making it clear al-Shabaab is “the biggest threat to civilians” in the country, including both deliberate murders and collateral damage.


Medical teams frequently complain about the dangerous conditions in the violent rural areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). An alarming report published by Doctors Without Borders on Thursday said the effort to contain the Ebola outbreak in the Congo is “failing” due to community distrust and factional violence, including over 30 attacks on Ebola treatment centers over the past seven months.

Doctors Without Borders, commonly known by the acronym MSF for the French version of its name, said on Thursday it has temporarily shut down two treatment facilities near the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak because unknown attackers set them on fire. Dozens of other security incidents were reported last month. Over a hundred different armed groups are active in the area.

“The existing atmosphere can only be described as toxic. It shows how the response has failed to listen and act on the needs of those most affected,” warned MSF President Joanne Liu.

Liu said the problem is exacerbated by heavy-handed DRC government tactics that amount to dragging reluctant villagers into medical centers for involuntary treatment.

“Using police to force people into complying with health measures is not only unethical, it’s totally counterproductive,” she said.

MSF’s latest update on the Congo outbreak stated that over 40 percent of the new cases of Ebola detected this year were people who contracted the disease and died without leaving their communities to seek medical treatment. Furthermore, 43 percent of new patients over the past three weeks had no known connections to previous Ebola cases, making it difficult to track the spread of the disease.

“We have a striking contradiction,” said Liu. “On the one hand, we have a rapid and large outbreak response with new medical tools such as vaccines and treatments that show promising outcomes when people come early. On the other hand, people with Ebola are dying in their communities, and do not trust the Ebola response enough to come forward.”

Liu described aspects of the DRC’s forceful Ebola response that would seem terrifying to villagers: fleets of vehicles arriving to pick up a sick individual, people instructed to wash their hands but not given soap, dead bodies sprayed with chlorine and unceremoniously buried in plastic bags while their possessions are burned to keep Ebola from spreading.

The New York Times on Thursday contributed the story of a family that dressed up a young woman who died of Ebola, painted her face with makeup, propped her up in the seat of a car, and attempted to drive her through disease-control checkpoints so she could be buried next to her husband, a fellow Ebola victim. The effort was unsuccessful but demonstrated both a lack of understanding about how Ebola works and a lack of trust in the authorities, especially what rural Congolese see as a lack of respect for their burial traditions.

MSF said one of the latest discouraging wrinkles in the Ebola crisis came when the DRC suspended elections, leading skeptics of the government to suspect the Ebola outbreak is nothing but a political ploy.

DRC officials countered by insisting military personnel deployed to the outbreak area are not “involved in Ebola response activities” and have not been instructed to “enforce sanitary measures.”

MSF physicians say they have more success getting villagers to accept vaccinations when government troops are not present, but unfortunately their lives could be at risk from armed insurgents if they do not travel with military protection.

The number of Ebola cases reported in the Congo now numbers over 900 with 569 fatalities.


Extremism in the Somali community of Minneapolis has long been a concern of American counterterrorism officials, as both the Islamic State and al-Qaeda’s ally al-Shabaab have been alarmingly successful at recruiting from the area. The district represented by Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) has seen more men and boys attempt to join foreign terrorist organizations over the last 12 years than any other district in the United States.

A Fox News report in February noted federal officials are still “highly concerned” about Minneapolis even though ISIS lost its “caliphate” in Syria and Iraq:

FBI stats show 45 Somalis left to join the ranks of either the Somalia-based Islamic insurgency al-Shabab, or the Iraq- and Syria-based ISIS combined. And as of 2018, a dozen more had been arrested with the intention of leaving to support ISIS. Both numbers are far higher than those of alleged terrorist wannabes who left or attempted to leave the country from other areas in the country where Muslim refugees have been resettled. In the case of the Somalis, it’s no longer just the men. Early last year, a female was apprehended by authorities on charges of supporting providing material support to Al Qaeda and arson. […] “We are very conscious that there may still be fertile ground for that, and that is could re-start at any time,” one federal official told Fox News. “Based on historical experience, we had (an uptick) in 2007 and 2008 going for al-Shabab, then a lull. Then, as ISIS came back, we saw a whole bunch of people no longer headed for Somalia. They were headed for Iraq and Syria. That really caught us off-guard, we didn’t see that coming. It didn’t make sense to us. We understood why kids were going back to Somalia, but going to Syria was another we issue.”

The Fox report noted ISIS aggressively recruits online, while al-Shabaab works the insular Somali community with “word of mouth” and “face-to-face radicalization.” A major element of the al-Shabaab recruiting pitch involves blaming Somalia’s woes on foreign intervention and promising the terrorist group will create an Islamist paradise governed by strict sharia law.

National security analysts told Fox News part of the problem is the difficulty Somalian immigrants have with assimilating to American culture, making it easier for terrorist recruiters to play on their sense of alienation and exploit their affinity for Somali culture and Islam. The insular nature of the Somali community also makes it difficult for law enforcement to collect information or establish agents. A police crackdown on street gangs in Minneapolis further alienated Somali youth and drove them into extremist mosques.

The analysts who spoke to Fox were highly critical of Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) because she seeks leniency for terrorist recruits and exacerbates the Somali community’s sense of paranoia and alienation:

As for Omar, she spoke up for a group of six Somalis arrested in 2015 for trying to cross into Mexico, as part of a plan to join ISIS in Syria. As the case went to trial the following year, the then-state representative wrote a letter to the trial judge requesting “compassion” – and lighter sentencing on behalf of one of the Minnesota men, who was facing 30 years jail time. “Such punitive measures not only lack efficacy, they inevitably create an environment in which extremism can flourish, aligning with the presupposition of terrorist recruitment,” Omar wrote. “The best deterrent to fanaticism is a system of compassion. We must alter our attitude and approach; if we truly want to affect change, we should refocus our efforts on inclusion and rehabilitation.” Her position has been slammed by those who say she hasn’t taken a tough enough stand. “Rep. Omar is asking for our justice system to support known terrorists, this sets an extremely poor precedence and should not be allowed,” contended Rudolph Atallah, chief executive officer of White Mountain Research, and former Africa Counterterrorism in the Office of the Secretary of Defense. “She clearly has a bias and an agenda and does not understand what the United States truly stands for.”

This analysis is hardly limited to Fox News. NPR published an entire series in 2009 about the “Somali-Minneapolis Terrorist Axis” that hit the same basic points. Al-Shabaab has operatives who specialize at recruiting and training young men from Minneapolis. The FBI has worried for a decade that some of those recruits will use their dangerous skills in the United States.

The Washington Post in July wrote of the dangerous paradox that efforts to combat radicalization in the Minneapolis Somali community tend to exacerbate the very “fear and paranoia” that give terrorist recruiters so much to work with.

The Obama administration’s deliberately vague “Countering Violent Extremism” project made things worse by not telling Somali youths exactly what they were supposed to be avoiding, although the Post also cited concerns that making the message more specific – such as renaming the initiative to “Countering Islamic Extremism” – would just alienate the community in a different way.

Local activists complain money spent on counter-extremism programs would be better invested in community improvements, with an eye toward turning young people away from extremism by getting them involved in sports or giving them better sources of information about traditional Somali culture than terrorist recruiters. Unfortunately, the community has a history of losing funds for high-minded projects to fraud, and some of that money might be ending up in the hands of al-Shabaab and other extremist groups.

Recommendations for solving the problem vary widely, but almost everyone familiar with the Somali community in Minneapolis agrees insularity and alienation are its biggest problems. It is therefore profoundly unhelpful to watch the national Democrat Party excuse Rep. Omar’s anti-Semitism by arguing she represents an inscrutable alien culture that Americans must learn to accommodate.


WASHINGTON, DC — The top American commander in Africa warned lawmakers on Thursday against the potential expansion of China’s military activities beyond its first overseas base in Djibouti and Russia’s deployment of mercenaries to the Central African Republic (CAR) and ongoing military support for Libyan strongman Gen. Khalifa Haftar who has been accused of war crimes.

Gen. Thomas Waldhauser’s comments echoed U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton’s remarks in releasing President Donald Trump’s Africa strategy in December 2018.

Bolton cautioned that Russian and Chinese “predatory practices” on the continent — aimed at extracting natural resources and building alliances to the detriment of American influence — “interfere with U.S. military operations and pose a significant threat to U.S. national security interests.”

During a House Armed Services Committee hearing on Thursday, Gen. Waldhauser, the head of U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) declared:

Djibouti is the first overseas Chinese base. I have said before I don’t believe it will be the last. They are looking for other areas and so forth to especially ports because what they want to do to a large degree the infrastructure, they build ports, roads, bridges and whatnot is tied to the extraction, mineral extraction, they are conducting in those countries. … Their military growth for the future although unclear they certainly want to protect those investments. They want to protect their populations and the workers that they have there. So some would say that this was just the first step…We have some reports that [we] could probably go into [in a] closed [classified] session that they may look to increase their contributions to some of these groups that are in the counterterrorism effort. So I think that in the future it’s very likely that they could increase their military presence.

Meanwhile, Russia is deploying paramilitary troops into Africa in the form of mercenaries working with the private military company Wagner Group, which is linked to the Kremlin’s military intelligence apparatus, the top American commander warned, telling lawmakers:

What the Russians are doing in the Central African Republic is very concerning because they have the paramilitary group, the Wagner Group, who is heavily involved there, not only in training, but also an influence at the highest levels of government to include the president. And meanwhile, they been able to work the situation so they can have mineral extraction and so forth, gold, et cetera, to generate revenue as well. And so this model is very concerning in that if you bring in paramilitary group, they influence the government, they extract resources, this is very concerning if that model would be applied in another country.

Echoing Waldhauser, the Telegraph revealed this week that the Wagner Group has provided Gen. Haftar with at least 300 mercenaries and weapons.

Russia is reportedly using its support for Libyan strongman Gen. Haftar to ensure its influence in the oil-rich North African nation. Haftar is the leader of the Libyan National Army (LNA) — accused of war crimes by human rights groups — and the Tobruk-based breakaway government in eastern Libya.

Gen. Waldhauser testified:

Behind the scenes, there’s no doubt about the fact they [Russia] supported the LNA with all kinds of equipment, people, training, and the like. And they’ve supported Hafta. …[Support for Haftar] gives them influence and it gives them influence in a key location in the southern [Mediterranean], on the southern part of NATO, if you will, and it allows them then to reinvigorate some old [dictator Muammar] Gaddafi era contracts in the oilfield, weapon sales, and the like. So there’s a strategic interest for them to be behind both sides [including the United Nations-brokered government], but primarily, really, Haftar.

As part of the Trump administration’s decision to prioritize the fight against strategic competitors China and Russia, the U.S. has decided to reduce its counterterrorism presence in Africa.

The move comes despite the growing influence of China and Russia as well as the intensifying threat posed by jihadi groups on the continent.

Gen. Waldhauser argued the reductions will not affect America’s counterterrorism fight in Africa, telling lawmakers, “We’ll continue to provide intelligence, we’ll continue to provide logistic support and, with partners like the French and Western Africa.”

Referring to the proposed reduction of about 700 U.S. counterterrorism troops in Africa that is already underway, Waldhauser said:

At the moment, we don’t see a significant issue there. And whether we’ll ever be directed to execute the second half [of the withdrawal] is to be determined. …If we feel that it’s not in our best interest to do so, we will…push back on the plan that’s in place at the moment.

The general argued that the current U.S. military presence in Africa is “adequate” to deal with the growing threat of strategic competitors China and Russia.

“We need to…have [the current] 6,000 or so conventional forces plus Special Operations Forces on the continent today. We need to maintain that threshold force in order” to address the threats to American interests in Africa posed jihadi groups as well as Russia and China, he said.

Kathryn Wheelbarger, the acting assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs, noted that U.S. resources are struggling to keep up with the threat in Africa posed by jihadis and strategic rivals China and Russia.

“We’re trying to have a much more focused capability to, you know, bring resources to bear. We are challenged to keep up,” she told lawmakers.

The U.S. military has accused China of using its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative, also known as the One Belt, One Road (OBOR) project, as a vehicle to push predatory loans in Africa collateralized with natural resources and strategic assets.

Experts have warned that China’s “predatory lending practices” in Africa— used to undermine borrower countries’ sovereignty — allow Beijing to strengthen its military ties to the continent, enhance political leverage, export communist authoritarian ideology, and gain access to viable army positions that can threaten the American homeland.

The U.S. military considers the BRI project a national security threat. Under BRI, Beijing seeks to build an extensive network of infrastructure that would help connect China to the rest of Asia, as well as Africa, Europe, and even Latin America.

Gen. Waldhauser acknowledged that not all Chinese activities in Africa are bad, adding that there is room for cooperation with the United States.

“There are places, certainly on the African continent, where you know, we have to cooperate with the Chinese, but there were times we have to confront and also compete with them,” he said.


Pope Francis will focus on the situation of migrants when he visits Morocco at the end of March, according to the nation’s bishops.

In a press conference in Casablanca Tuesday, the archbishop of Rabat, Cristobal Lopez Romero, and the archbishop of Tangier, Santiago Agrelo Martinez, told reporters that the pope would be coming to Morocco as a shepherd, reaching out to the peripheries.

More than half of the 27,000 Catholic faithful living in Morocco are immigrants, many of them coming from Sub-Saharan Africa looking for work or educational opportunities, or en route to Europe. Assisted by local parishes, many of these hope to be able to see the pope during his apostolic visit this March 30-31.

“For logistical reasons the pope’s visit will center on the city of Rabat,” said the city’s Archbishop Cristobal Lopez Romero, “but there has been a great effort so that Christians from all around the country can travel to be able to see him. All the parishes are already mobilizing to find the way to bring as many people as possible.”

“Pope Francis loves to go to frontiers, to places of transit,” Romero said.

Tangier’s Archbishop Santiago Agrelo Martinez said that the pope’s visit would help highlight the situation of migrants, many of whom live in precarious conditions in the Muslim majority country.

“We have to prioritize to whom the aid goes first. Our church suffers from lack of funds,” said Agrelo Martinez. “We can give migrants food, plastic, covers, yet we can’t give them the respect they deserve. They are people, not animals.”

Agrelo Martinez said he hopes that Francis’s visit will bring hope and healing.

“We sometimes lose hope and I hope that the Pope’s visit will bring progress on this issue,” he said, adding that his “greatest concern” is the rights of migrants, who lack the means to defend themselves legally.

In past years, Morocco has distinguished itself in fighting against Islamic extremism by breaking up a series of Islamic terror cells and thwarting attacks.

As part of its efforts against terrorism, Morocco set up its own home intelligence agency in 2015, the Bureau Central d’Investigation Judiciaire (BCJI), which has taken credit for uncovering 40 terrorist cells and arresting nearly 600 people in its first two years of operations.

Also in 2015, Morocco passed a law calling for the monitoring of Moroccan travelers visiting Libya, Syria, or Iraq and stipulated severe punitive measures for anyone connected to terror groups.

The Moroccan population is overwhelmingly Muslim, with more than 99 percent of the nation professing Sunni Islam.

The remaining one percent is composed of Christians, Jews, Shia Muslims, and Bahais, who enjoy relative freedom of worship, which does not extend to full religious freedom, according to the U.S. Commission for International Religious Freedom (USCIRF).

The government of Burundi has forced the United Nations to close its local human rights office, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet announced on Tuesday.

The office in Burundi was opened in 1995 in the wake of shocking human rights violations perpetrated in the country following the murder of then-President Melchior Ndadaye. According to Reuters, the government claims that the progress they have made in terms of protecting human rights means the office is “no longer justified.”

“It is with deep regret that we have had to close our office in Burundi after a 23-year presence in the country,” Bachelet said. “Since the UN Human Rights Office in Burundi was established in 1995, for many years we worked with the Government on peacebuilding, security sector reform, justice sector reform and helped build institutional and civil society capacity on a whole host of human rights issues.”

As noted by the U.N.’s news agency, the office “helped ensure the incorporation of a human rights dimension to the implementation of the Arusha Agreement, which was the bedrock of the country’s stability for many years.”

However, human rights violations have become widespread since a surge in violence that began in 2015 after President Pierre Nkurunziza announced he would seek a third term, which opponents denounced as unconstitutional. Despite winning re-election, the move sparked mass demonstrations and a brutal security crackdown that left hundreds dead and forced around half a million people to flee the country.

“Unfortunately, many of these human rights gains have been seriously jeopardized since 2015,” Bachelet continued. “This meant that UN human rights staff were severely hampered in their ability to look into allegations of violations,” the High Commissioner said. Nonetheless, the UN Human Rights Office, in Burundi itself and at its Geneva headquarters, has continued to receive allegations of human rights violations and abuses.”

Bachelet also expressed her disappointment at the government’s lack of cooperation with the office, even threatening its employees and deporting foreign experts on charges of “spying.”

“Our reports on the human rights situation in Burundi have always been developed in a constructive spirit, intended to support the promotion and protection of human rights in the country,” she continued. “But I am disappointed by Burundi’s lack of cooperation in recent years with UN human rights mechanisms – which even went so far as to include threats to prosecute members of the independent international Commission of Inquiry established by the UN Human Rights Council.”

A private security company affiliated with the Russian military intelligence has been backing strongman Gen. Khalifa Haftar from Libya’s breakaway government with 300 mercenaries and has supplied his Libyan National Army (LNA) accused of war crimes with artillery, tanks, drones, and ammunition, the Telegraph recently found.

Russia’s support came as the general and his LNA forces consolidated their control of large swathes of territory in the eastern and southern part of Libya. Early last month, the U.S. military cautioned about the presence of “oligarch-funded, quasi-mercenary” Russian “military advisors” in Africa.

On Sunday, the Telegraph confirmed:

The murky private military company Wagner Group has been supporting Khalifa Haftar with 300 personnel in Benghazi and has supplied his Libyan National Army with artillery, tanks, drones and ammunition, a Whitehall source said. … The Russian defense ministry did not respond to requests for comment. …The news of Wagner’s involvement in Libya corresponds with Russia’s push to increase influence in Africa through an arsenal ranging from arms and energy deals to covert military and political support.

With the help of Russia and other countries, including neighboring Egypt and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Gen. Haftar has conquered most of eastern and southern Libya, including the largest oil field in the country.

A source close to the Libyan Russian Oil & Gas Joint Company told the Telegraph in April that “lots of Wagner fighters went [to Libya], and there are rumors that military personnel also went there”.

“They are trying to secure the deep-water ports of Tobruk and Derna for the Russian Fleet” and also “could control the flow of oil to southern Europe” if they take over Libya’s energy industry, the source reportedly added.

The LNA has defeated jihadist groups and allegedly committed war crimes against civilians as it advanced across eastern and southern Libya.

As the main leader of the Tobruk-based breakaway government in eastern Libya, Gen. Haftar is the top rival of the internationally recognized administration in Tripoli led by Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj from the United Nations-brokered Government of National Accord (GNA).

Haftar and PM Sarraj agreed to hold elections last Thursday, without setting a specific date for the vote.

Over the weekend, Gen. Haftar’s LNA declared that it had captured Libya’s southern border with Algeria, claiming they now control all of the North African country’s borders except one to the west that lies along Tunisia’s international boundary, the Libyan Express reported.

The U.S. military has expressed concerns about Russia’s activities in Libya, which has descended into chaos since the NATO-backed overthrow of dictator Muammar Qaddafi in 2011, ultimately becoming a fertile ground for the likes of the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) and al-Qaeda.

Anna Borshchevskaya, an expert on Russian foreign policy at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, warned U.S. lawmakers in 2017:

Moscow’s foothold in Libya is growing. This issue is important to watch in the months ahead. Putin increasingly supports Libya’s Gen. Khalifa Haftar, who controls the oil-rich eastern part of the country but wants more.

Libya’s turmoil led to the formation of the two rival governments — one in Tobruk led by Haftar and the internationally recognized one Tripoli.

Haftar served under Gaddafi before going into exile in the United States after falling out of the dictator’s favor. Some news outlets have crowned Haftar the “New Qaddafi.”


A young Zimbabwe lawmaker could face up to 20 years in jail for urging her constituents to attend widespread anti-government protests in January that led to three deaths at the hands of state security forces.

Zimbabwe opposition lawmaker Joanna Mamombe, 25, was arrested in Harare this weekend on charges of subversion after she allegedly asked her constituents to participate in anti-government protests in January over the sharp rise in gasoline prices and the country’s worsening economic crisis.

The demonstrations were eventually crushed by the country’s military, who have since arrested around 1,000 people for their involvement. Those detained include dozens of opposition officials, labor leaders, and political activists.

Mamombe’s lawyer Jeremiah Bhamu confirmed his client’s arrest and said she is expected in court this week.

“She was brought to Harare and she has been charged with subverting a constitutionally-elected government and the allegations are that she addressed a press conference on January 14 and advocated, suggested or urged people to engage in civil disobedience and called for (sabotaging of) government’s essential services intending to overthrow the government,” he said.

Mamombe’s party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), reacted angrily to the news, accusing the ruling Zanu PF of creating “vigilante groups” to crack down on all political opposition.

“A team of about eight henchmen, who snatched Honourable Mamombe Boko Haram style, claimed to be from the police Law and Order section and were driving a Toyota Fortuner registration number ACI 4582,” explained party chief whip Prosper Mutseyami.

“This is a result of the Zanu PF military-political settlement, which has seen them create vigilante groups and vested powers of the state to these killer units resulting in the death of at least 17 people in January and seven others on August 1, 2018,” he continued.

President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who succeeded the ousted dictator Robert Mugabe in 2017 and won a disputed presidential election last year, has accused Western countries of engineering the protests in a bid to oust his far-left regime.

“We regret the loss of life but we needed to protect property as well as other citizens not involved in the protests,” Mnangagwa said last month. “We have told the western countries that they cannot turn around and raise concerns when they are the ones sponsoring the violence.”

In a statement, the U.S. Embassy in Harare condemned the arrests, warning that such repression damages the country’s reputation in the post-Mugabe era.

Harassment and targeted arrests of civil society leaders damage Zimbabwe’s reputation & economic future. We call on the Zimbabwean government to uphold its constitution, protect human rights, and foster an environment where all can contribute to the nation’s progress. — U.S. Embassy Harare (@usembassyharare) February 26, 2019

“Harassment and targeted arrests of civil society leaders damage Zimbabwe’s reputation & economic future,” they wrote. “We call on the Zimbabwean government to uphold its constitution, protect human rights, and foster an environment where all can contribute to the nation’s progress.”

The United States and its allies are losing the war against Islamic terrorism in the Sahel region of Africa, a top American general on the continent cautioned Thursday.

In an interview with Voice of America (VOA), U.S. Maj. Gen. Marcus Hicks, the head of U.S. Special Operations Command Africa, also urged President Donald Trump’s administration not to reduce the American military presence in Africa any further after the Pentagon pulled out up to 200 forces from West Africa, home to Boko Haram and the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL).

Although Gen. Hicks said he “would not recommend more drones or more advisers” at this time, he added that he would not advise reducing the American military footprint in the region neither.

“We’re trying to avoid as much as possible the kinetic activity that could eventually disenfranchise the people from the legitimate government,” the top general noted.

As part of the Trump administration’s decision to prioritize the fight against strategic competitors Russia and China, the Pentagon ordered a ten percent American troop reduction in Africa over the next few years.

There are an estimated 6,000 American troops and 1,000 Pentagon civilians or contractors deployed across Africa, mainly training and conducting exercises with local forces.

“I would tell you at this time, we are not winning” in the Sahel region, Gen. Hicks told VOA Thursday.

Hicks, however, also told the New York Times (NYT), “The notion that we’re leaving the Sahel is simply not true. This is just a natural transition,” referring to the recent withdrawal of American troops from Africa.

The head of U.S. Africa Command’s (AFRICOM) special operations wing spoke to news outlets on the sidelines of Flintlock, a major American-led military drill in the region that involves about 2,000 commandoes from more than 30 African and Western countries.

Burkina Faso — which is plagued by an insurgency from several al-Qaeda affiliates — hosted the exercise this year.

“What we fight against, what we see every day is like a toxin,” Lt. Col. Coulibaly Kanou from Burkina Faso told VOA. “I do not know what the terrorists want from us.”

“The threat is growing,” U.S. Ambassador to Burkina Burkina Faso Andrew Young told VOA. “We’re in a tough fight, and the fight is getting harder.”

Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), considered the international terrorist organization’s “wealthiest” wing, likely generates tens of millions of dollars annually, primarily through drug trafficking linked to violent Latin American cartels, the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) think tank revealed in December 2017.

In response to the jihadi threat, the U.S. embassy in Burkina Faso is expected to boost the amount of resources applied to the deteriorating security conditions in the African country and efforts devoted to economic development.

“We have asked for resources, and the resources have been provided to us to accomplish the mission,” Amb. Young declared.

According to the most recent Global Terrorism Index (GTI), compiled by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP), terrorism is on the rise in Africa.

GTI revealed that Africa in 2017 was home to half of the top ten countries with the highest number of terror-linked fatalities — Somalia, Egypt, Central African Republic, Mali, and Kenya.

Despite the rise in terrorism, the U.S. military already withdrew between 100 and 200 American troops from West Africa where thousands of jihadis from Boko Haram and its Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) breakaway faction are wreaking havoc.

“U.S. military officials have not revealed where future troop cuts will hit,” VOA noted, adding, “Niger and Mali are fighting al-Qaida-linked militants, and Chad is combating a militant push from the expansion of Islamic State and Boko Haram in neighboring Nigeria.”

NYT reported on Friday:

President Trump has ordered most American troops to withdraw from Syria. He wants to bring home thousands more from Afghanistan. Now hundreds of United States commandos and other forces are leaving West Africa — despite an onslaught of attacks from an increasingly deadly matrix of Islamist fighters. The shift has unnerved African commanders in Burkina Faso and neighboring nations in the Sahel, a vast sub-Saharan scrubland increasingly racked by bombings, massacres, kidnappings and attacks on hotels frequented by Westerners.

In releasing U.S. President Donald Trump’s Africa strategy in December 2018, U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton acknowledged the jihadi threat on the continent and warned that Russian and Chinese activities threaten American interests.

“France, the former colonial power in West Africa, maintains 4,500 troops in the region to help battle insurgents in Niger, Chad, and Mali, where it routed Al Qaeda’s affiliate from the north in 2013,” the Times acknowledged.

As the United States and its partners dial down operations against the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq and contemplate a withdrawal from Afghanistan, the focus of global jihadist activity will shift to Africa,” Stratfor, a private intelligence firm, predicted on Thursday.


A suicide bombing attack on a hotel in Mogadishu, Somalia on Thursday evening quickly escalated into a massive gun battle between Somali security forces and jihadis loyal to al-Shabaab, the al-Qaeda ally that is becoming increasingly active across the region.

30 fatalities and 80 injuries are the worst estimates so far in Mogadishu’s worst terrorist attack in years. Official estimates provided to the media on Friday morning counted about half as many dead and injured, but said the numbers were likely to rise, especially since the area around the hotel was packed with diners and shoppers when the unusual nighttime attack began.

The attack began with a pair of bombs detonated outside the Hotel Maka al-Mukarama, the largest hotel in Mogadishu. The death toll from these explosions was not been completely tallied up as of Friday morning. The bombs were powerful enough to collapse several buildings and set dozens of parked vehicles ablaze. Rescue workers compared the carnage to a 2017 truck bombing that killed over 500 people. News agencies reported hospitals overflowing with horrible injuries and police firing shots into the air to keep crowds away from the conflict zone.

The hotel advertises the security of its area as a selling point for guests, who include many government officials, making it an inviting high-profile target for the jihadis. Al-Shabaab has targeted the building before, but Thursday’s attack appears to be their bloodiest success.

“Al-Shabaab like attacking Maka al-Mukarama because it is the heart of Somalia,” political analyst Hassan Haile told the BBC.

Haile said the area around the hotel is among the most heavily guarded streets in the city but the terrorists have been able to stage repeated attacks by bribing police or threatening their families.

“There is negligence from the government,” he said. “The soldiers have no money and they don’t get encouragement which makes these kinds of attacks possible.”

Former Somali security official Abdisalam Guled told the BBC the attack was part of al-Shabaab’s retaliation for increased U.S. airstrikes. He said the terrorist gang is taking advantage of the mismanagement Haile described, exploiting low morale among security forces, and acting more aggressively as African Union troops are withdrawn from Somalia.

After the bombs went off, a squad of terrorist gunmen attacked, occupying a residential structure next to the hotel. The Somali government responded with its counter-insurgency “Alpha Group,” an elite rapid-response force trained by American special forces. The ensuing gun battle was still in progress after the sun rose on Friday morning.

“The government tried three times to enter the building but we repulsed them. We still control the hotel,” an al-Shabaab spokesman said on Friday.

Police officials said the militants are using grenades and Kalashnikov rifles to fight security troops. At least two soldiers have been seen leaving the area on stretchers.


U.S. troops in Africa recently pledged to provide additional support to an ongoing Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) offensive against Boko Haram and the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) breakaway faction in the Lake Chad region.

Jihadis from the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) broke away from the Nigeria-based Boko Haram terrorist group in 2016 over leadership differences. The U.S. government has treated both groups — which operate in and around Nigeria — as different entities.

The MNJTF — a coalition of troops mainly from Nigeria, Chad, Niger, Benin, and Cameroon that has been fighting Boko Haram for years — recently launched a military offensive dubbed “Operation Yacin Tafki” to push jihadis out of the Lake Chad region.

Troops from U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) provide some support to MNJTF’s counterterrorism efforts in the form of intelligence, training, advisers, and equipment, while avoiding direct engagement in military operations, which border the task force members’ countries.

In a press release published on Wednesday, the MNJTF revealed:

The United States Africa Command (US AFRICOM) has pledged to support the Multinational Joint Task Force in the ongoing Operation YANCIN TAFKI in the Lake Chad Area. The Commander, Special Operations US AFRICOM, Major General Marcus Hicks gave this hint during a recent visit to the Tactical Headquarters of the Multinational Joint Task Force in Diffa, Republic of Niger.

U.S. Maj. Gen. Rogers Cloutier from AFRICOM also visited the African task force headquarters in Chad.

“Discussions between the Force Commander, Major General Chikezie Ude, and General Cloutier focused on the role of the MNJTF in combating the threat of Boko Haram and the Islamic State in West Africa,” the coalition’s press statement added.

U.S. Maj. Gen. Marcus Hicks reportedly offered intelligence support while addressing the African troops.

Brig. Gen. Seydou Badjie, the deputy force commander of MNJTF, reportedly commended the U.S. military for “its interests in the activities of MNJTF” and urged AFRICOM to remain engaged “in order to deal with Boko Haram.”

For the most part, the U.S. has avoided providing direct military assistance to Nigeria over the country’s alleged human rights violations.

AFRICOM has often chosen to work directly with neighboring Cameroon, Chad, and Niger, bypassing Nigeria.

Gen. Thomas Waldhauser, the AFRICOM chief, told U.S. lawmakers in early February:

We do not have offensive strike capabilities or authorities in those countries [where Boko Haram and ISWAP operate], so we can’t strike. We can strike in Somalia, we can strike in Libya, but not in Nigeria, Chad and the like. So we don’t have authorities there. Now, ISIS West Africa has grown. They go by different names every once in a while, but they have grown in numbers. There now in the neighborhood probably in the neighborhood of around 3 to 4,000.

Waldhauser noted that Boko Haram has about 1,000 fighters. The AFRICOM commander also said that the U.S. has intensified efforts to expand Nigeria’s intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities.

In releasing U.S. President Donald Trump’s strategy in December 2018, U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton indicated that the United States intended to continue ramping up military pressure on jihadi groups in Africa.

The most recent Global Terrorism Index (GTI), compiled by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP), revealed that Africa is home to half of the top ten countries with the highest number of terror-linked fatalities — Somalia, Egypt, Central African Republic, Mali, and Kenya.

“As the United States and its partners dial down operations against the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq and contemplate a withdrawal from Afghanistan, the focus of global jihadist activity will shift to Africa,” the private intelligence firm Stratfor predicted on Thursday.


The founder of the Filipino website Rappler, which has been strongly critical of hardline President Rodrigo Duterte, has been arrested for the second time on violating laws barring foreign ownership of media.

Journalist Maria Ressa was re-arrested at Manila airport on Thursday, and was later charged with violating laws barring the ownership or management of domestic media outlets by foreign entities, as well as a separate charge of securities fraud. She was later granted bail after posting a 90,000 peso ($1700) bond.

“Obviously, this is yet another abuse of my rights. I am being treated like a criminal when my only crime is to be an independent journalist,” she told reporters. “Every action takes us farther into a descent into tyranny. This is the weaponization of the law.”

Advocates for press freedom say the veteran reporter, who was named as one of Time Magazine’s People of the Year in 2018, say that Duterte is targeting her because of Rappler’s critical reporting of his administration.

Ressa’s lawyer Francis Lim said in a statement they were not surprised and had “prepared ourselves for it,” after several of her colleagues were charged with similar crimes this week.

“Let it be crystal clear that these acts of harassment will not deter our clients from doing their duty as journalists,” Lim said. “We believe in the rule of law and it is our fervent hope that we will prevail in the end.”

The 55-year-old told CNN that she was very concerned about other colleagues at Rappler who may now be targeted.

“I’m very worried about our directors. These are upstanding, successful members of the business community, the tech industry,” she said. “It’s insane, it has ripples not (only) in terms of press freedom, but business. I’ve overused the word ‘ludicrous’ (in describing previous legal procedures). It’s sad to see my nation like this, it’s an abuse of power and weaponization of the law.” Fears over a press clampdown are heightened given that Rappler has been a vocal critic of Duterte’s security crackdown, that has involved the aggressive targeting of communists, Islamists, and drug traffickers. The campaign group The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) accused Philippine officials of “abusing their authority by issuing arrest warrants” against Ressa and other journalists. “It is clear that the government is manipulating the law to muzzle and intimidate one of its most credible media critics. This egregious harassment must stop,” the organization said in a statement.

WASHINGTON, DC — The United States must tackle the Taliban’s top source of funding in Afghanistan – deadly opium and its heroin derivative – whether there is a peace agreement or not, U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) John Sopko told Breitbart News on Thursday.

Sopko’s assessment of Afghanistan’s insidious narcotics problem came soon after he delivered a speech at the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS) about the watchdog agency’s 2019 High-Risk List report, which identifies significant threats to America’s $132 billion reconstruction effort.

Breitbart News asked, “What happens if the United States fails to push the Taliban to cut its ties to the cultivation and trafficking of opium in Afghanistan during the peace talks?”

The SIGAR chief replied:

I can’t discuss the peace talks, so maybe they are doing it, I don’t know, but as we highlight [in the high-risk list report], the Taliban are intimately involved with the narcotics problem so what we just highlighted is you have to deal with that. If there is a peace treaty or not, how do you get the Taliban out of the narcotics trade? And that’s a complication to [the] reintegration [of an estimated 60,000 Taliban jihadis into Afghan society] and so on. Again, I don’t know I can’t discuss the peace because we’re not part of it, but obviously, it’s a big issue because we’ve identified the narcotics as a major source of funding for the Taliban.

SIGAR stressed that the illicit narcotics trade in Afghanistan is a significant menace to America’s nation-building efforts. Sopko acknowledged that some reconstruction efforts have benefited the opium trade.

The watchdog agency cast doubt on whether or not a peace agreement will “translate into the collapse or contraction of the illicit drug trade,” noting the opium trade plays a significant part in feeding the ailing Afghan economy.

The report declared:

A truce or peace settlement between the Taliban and the Afghan government may not necessarily lead to a decline in the illicit narcotics trade…With or without a peace agreement, Afghanistan runs the risk of becoming a ‘narco-state’ and has already been described as such by former officials from the U.S. government and international organizations. …The country requires a growing economy or favorable economic conditions to provide farmers and former insurgents with legitimate employment and a reliable income to replace opium poppy cultivation.

Despite nearly $9 billion awarded by the United States for anti-drug operations since the war began in October 2001, Afghanistan remains the top producer of opium and heroin in the world. The U.S. Drug Enforce Agency (DEA) confirmed to Breitbart News earlier this year that a small amount of Afghan heroin is fueling the historic number of lethal drug overdoses in the United States.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of State (DOS) — which oversees the intensified peace-seeking efforts by President Donald Trump’s administration — indicated that it is unclear whether or not the United States is urging the Taliban to stop cultivating and trafficking opium as part of the peace negotiations.

SIGAR did report that at the February 2019 peace talks hosted by Russia in February 2019 — a separate ordeal from the U.S. efforts — the Taliban delegation vowed to “reduce poppy cultivation and drug trafficking to zero throughout the country” and work with neighboring countries to combat the illicit narcotics trade once the war ends.

Sopko told Breitbart News the United States must “trust and verify,” echoing former Republican U.S. President Ronald Reagan, adding in the report:

It is possible that the Taliban may be amenable following a peace agreement to reducing poppy cultivation in return for foreign assistance… However, it remains to be seen whether a future government in which the Taliban is a part would be willing or able to follow through with such promises.

Besides the Taliban, SIGAR has linked corrupt Afghan government officials and members of the country’s security forces to the lucrative opium business.

Citing the United Nations, SIGAR reported on Thursday:

In 2017, the poppy crop generated approximately $1.4 billion for Afghan farmers, plus billions more for refiners and traffickers, amounting to the equivalent of 20% to 32% of Afghanistan’s gross domestic product—a share about the size of the country’s entire licit agricultural sector and far exceeding licit exports of goods and services in 2016.

“A peace agreement is unlikely to change that dynamic, as shown by the record of other countries at peace which continue to produce large quantities of narcotics,” the watchdog agency continued, citing Colombia, which is producing unprecedented amounts of cocaine following the domestic government’s deal with the U.S.-designated terrorist group the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).

Sopko reported that that the opium trade could reverse the gains achieved by the hundreds of billions of dollars in American taxpayer funding devoted to the war, noting:

The illicit opium trade hinders the Afghan government’s efforts across numerous sectors, including security, governance, and economic and social development. The cultivation and trafficking of illicit drugs finances drug trafficking organizations and antigovernment groups, undermines the government’s legitimacy, and feeds corruption, benefiting insurgent groups and corrupt government officials alike.

The war in Afghanistan has come at a tremendous cost of blood and treasure to the United States — nearly $1 trillion or about $3 billion per month, 2,280 American military deaths, and more than 20,430 injuries.

Taliban narco-jihadis have rejected a Trump administration proposal to leave behind a residual U.S. counterterrorism force that could ensure the terrorist group keeps its promises. While the Taliban wants all foreign forces out in months, the United States has reportedly proposed pulling out its military troops within three to five years.

Sopko warned against keeping the flow of U.S. assistance going post-a peace deal-linked American military withdrawal, something that the Taliban wants.


A dispute erupted on Twitter this week between rival neighbors Pakistan and Afghanistan over U.S.-led peace talks with the Taliban, prompting the Pakistani minister for human rights to dismiss the American ambassador in Kabul as “little pigmy.”

The comments from Shireen Mazari, the minister, came after U.S. Ambassador John Bass rebuked Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan for allegedly suggesting on Monday that Afghanistan should set up an interim government to help expedite the U.S.-Taliban negotiations.

Afghan President Ashraf Ghani’s administration, who has rejected proposals for an interim government and the already delayed elections, quickly took issue with Khan’s comments.

Referring to Khan’s remarks, which the Pakistani Foreign Ministry claims were taken out of context, Gandhara, a component of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) noted, “The comments caused uproar in Afghanistan, which on March 26 recalled its Islamabad ambassador and summoned Pakistan’s deputy ambassador to Kabul to discuss what a Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman called the “irresponsible” remarks by Khan.”

On Wednesday, Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry argued that news outlets reported Khan’s comments “out of context…leading to [an] unwarranted reaction from various quarters.”

Nevertheless, Bass condemned Khan on Twitter, reportedly writing, “Some aspects of cricket apply well in diplomacy, some do not.”

Bass went on to urge the Pakistani leader to “resist [the] temptation to ball-tamper with the Afghanistan peace process and its internal affairs.”

Some aspects of #cricket apply well in diplomacy, some do not. @ImranKhanPTI, important to resist temptation to ball-tamper with the #Afghanistan peace process and its internal affairs. #AfgPeace — John R. Bass (@USAmbKabul) March 27, 2019

Those comments triggered a response on Twitter from Pakistani Minister Mazari, who wrote, “Clearly you little pygmy your knowledge of ball tampering is as void as your understanding of Afghanistan and the region! Clearly in your case ignorance is certainly not bliss”:

Clearly you little pygmy your knowledge of ball tampering is as void as your understanding of Afghanistan and the region! Clearly in your case ignorance is certainly not bliss! Another sign of Trumpian mischief a la Khalilzad style! https://t.co/ZOySvWJNDq — Shireen Mazari (@ShireenMazari1) March 27, 2019

Referring to U.S. President Donald Trump’s top Afghan reconciliation envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, the Pakistani minister then said Bass’s comments are yet “another sign of Trumpian mischief a la Khalilzad style!”

Khalilzad also blasted Pakistani PM Khan for his comments on Twitter.

While #Pakistan has made constructive contributions on the #AfghanPeaceProcess, PM Khan's comments did not. The future of #Afghanistan is for #Afghans, and only Afghans, to decide. The role of the international community is to encourage Afghans to come together so they can do so. — U.S. Special Representative Zalmay Khalilzad (@US4AfghanPeace) March 26, 2019

The dispute came as Khalilzad, the chief U.S. official leading the negotiators with the Taliban, heads back to the region as “part of the overall effort to facilitate a peace process that brings all Afghan parties together in inclusive intra-Afghan negotiations,” according to the U.S. Department of State (DOS).

DOS oversees the office of Khalilzad who has held several rounds of peace negotiations with the Taliban. The latest round led to two draft agreements — the eventual withdrawal of U.S. military troops and assurances by the Taliban that Afghanistan will not harbor international terrorists again as it did with al-Qaeda both before and after the September 11 attacks on the American homeland.

The U.S. has credited Pakistan with using its influence over the Taliban to bring the narco-jihadis to the peace negotiation table.

So far, ongoing peace negotiations have excluded Kabul at the Taliban’s behest, irking Kabul. Taliban terrorists, who are fighting to implement strict Islamic laws or Sharia, consider themselves the only legitimate government of Afghanistan, dismissing the Ghani administration as a U.S. “puppet.”

The recent Afghanistan-Pakistan rift marks the “third time in just over a month that Kabul has demanded an explanation from Islamabad over comments related to peace talks aimed at ending 17 years of war in Afghanistan,” NDTV reported.

President Trump has made the negotiated political reconciliation of Kabul and the Taliban the primary tenet of his strategy to end the nearly 18-year-old war.

The Taliban claims it will only talk to Kabul after the full withdrawal of foreign forces, rejecting U.S. proposals to keep a residual military force to ensure the terrorist group keeps its promises.


WASHINGTON, DC — A potential U.S.-Taliban peace deal “will likely” fail to prevent Afghanistan from grappling with terrorists and descending into a “narco-state,” the U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), a watchdog agency, declared in a report issued Thursday.

SIGAR chief John Sopko released the agency’s High-Risk List report, which covers threats to America’s multi-billion dollar nation-building efforts, at a Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) event.

The report declares:

With or without a peace settlement, Afghanistan will likely continue to grapple with multiple violent-extremist organizations, who threaten Afghanistan and the international community …With or without a peace agreement, Afghanistan runs the risk of becoming a ‘narco-state’ and has already been described as such by former officials from the U.S. government and international organizations.

According to the Pentagon, Afghanistan is still home to the “highest regional concentration of terrorist groups in the world.”

SIGAR cast doubt on whether or not the Taliban and Afghanistan as a whole will ever end its involvement in the opium trade, which serves as a major source of funding for both.

Citing the United Nations, the watchdog agency reveals:

In 2017, the poppy crop generated approximately $1.4 billion for Afghan farmers, plus billions more for refiners and traffickers, amounting to the equivalent of 20% to 32% of Afghanistan’s gross domestic product—a share about the size of the country’s entire licit agricultural sector and far exceeding licit exports of goods and services in 2016. A peace agreement is unlikely to change that dynamic.

The High-Risk List report identifies serious threats to America’s $132 billion reconstruction effort, including widespread insecurity, underdeveloped civil policing capabilities, endemic corruption, sluggish economic growth, the illicit narcotics trade, threats to women’s right, the challenge of reintegrating about 60,000 Taliban fighters into society and the country’s U.S.-backed security forces, and restricted oversight.

The report points out:

While an equitable and sustainable peace agreement in Afghanistan could end much of the violence that presents the greatest threat to the reconstruction effort, a peace agreement may bring its own set of challenges to sustaining the gains that the United States, its Coalition partners, and the Afghan government have achieved over that time. For example, a failure to successfully reintegrate Taliban fighters and their families into Afghan society, a failure to improve civil policing, and a failure to ensure effective oversight of continuing foreign financial assistance could each undermine the sustainability of any peace agreement that might be reached.

SIGAR notes that a peace deal may ultimately pose risks to the U.S.-funded reconstruction effort, including:

The capability and effective use of Afghan security forces, particularly for counterterrorism operations.

Protection of human rights, including the rights of Afghan women.

Securing democratic governance processes and upholding the rule of law.

Suppressing corruption.

Countering the narcotics trade and promoting alternative livelihoods for farmers.

Promoting economic growth and development.

Oversight of and accountability for U.S. funds provided directly to the Afghan government or routed to it via multilateral trust funds.

Sustainability of U.S.-funded institutions, programs, and property provided in Afghanistan.

Although the U.S. has devoted over $80 billion, the majority (about 65 percent) of reconstruction funding, to the development of the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF), they continue to suffer from capability lapses that hinder the effectiveness and readiness of the forces and may undermine the rule of law after a peace pact, SIGAR determines.

The ANDSF, which includes military and police units, are also unable to operate independent of U.S. military assistance, Sopko indicated at the CSIS event.

SIGAR reveals in the report:

Throughout the reconstruction effort, the United States has placed more emphasis on reconstructing the Afghan National Army (ANA) than on the Afghan National Police (ANP). In the event of a peace settlement, there is no comprehensive strategy for a competent civil police force backed by the rule of law. Current ANP sustainment costs are well beyond the Afghan government’s ability to fund and will require continued foreign assistance well into the future.

Echoing comments by Afghan President Ashraf Ghani in early 2018, the report notes that Afghanistan would collapse without international funding, which along with the opium trade are the main drivers of the war-ravaged country’s economy.

SIGAR notes:

The ANDSF will also continue to be constrained by capability and sustainability challenges. In a post-settlement environment, depending on the terms of an agreement, there may also be the challenge of integrating former Taliban fighters into the national security forces and society. …These issues could become more acute should international financial and military support decline sharply before, during, or after peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban.

In recent months, U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has boosted its efforts to achieve peace with the Taliban. The Trump administration has made the reconciliation of Kabul and the Afghan government the primary goal of its strategy to end the war.


Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen made a stopover in Hawaii on Wednesday after visiting several of Taiwan’s Pacific allies. From there she held a teleconference with the Heritage Foundation in which she praised the Trump administration’s support for Taiwan and its positive response to a request for more advanced weapons to hold China at bay.

“Taiwan is a force for good in the region,” Tsai told the Heritage panel. “We are a democracy, and the only democratic Chinese-speaking country in the world, showing – as Vice President Pence said – a better path forward for all of the Chinese people.”

“We’re proud that freedom and human rights are the basis of our values, and we are determined to take the lead in improving livelihoods across the Pacific,” she said, highlighting Taiwan’s efforts in medicine, humanitarian relief, economics, and human rights.

“Today, I want to make clear that we are ready to play our part in ensuring that the Indo-Pacific remains free and open for generations to come,” she said.

Tsai encouraged the free world to be “much more proactive in defending democratic values, both at home and abroad” because the enemies of democracy have become more proficient at subversion in the Information Age. She cited the relentless pressure campaign waged against Taiwan by authoritarian China as a prominent example.

“We have taken a much more aggressive approach to counteract the Chinese government’s infiltration of our society and economy, as well as their interference in our domestic affairs,” she said.

Tsai praised the close cooperation her government has received from the United States and Japan as a model for the aggressive mutual promotion of democracy she envisioned and vowed Taiwan would take the lead in pushing back against China’s campaign to expand its influence in the Pacific Islands.

“Taiwan is grateful for the United States’ support in keeping our diplomatic allies,” she said, alluding to China’s campaign to systematically isolate Taiwan. “We remain committed to working with like-minded countries to protect the core values of good government, accountability, and sustainable development in the Pacific.”

Tsai stressed the importance of maintaining a strong defense to deter Chinese aggression.

“Fortunately, in facing these challenges Taiwan does not stand alone,” she said. “The United States’ commitment to Taiwan is stronger than ever.”

Along those lines, Tsai said her government has held “frank discussions with the U.S. on the right equipment for Taiwan’s defense” and the Trump administration “is responding positively to our request.”

That request includes dozens of F-16V fighters and M1 Abrams tanks, the latter representing a major upgrade to Taiwan’s armored warfare capability. The Chinese government restated its firm opposition to the arms deal after Tsai’s remarks to the Heritage Foundation and repeated its routine threat to respond with “all necessary measures” if Taiwan makes a bid for full independence. Beijing also warned the U.S. could damage its relationship with China by selling arms to Taiwan.

Tsai mentioned Taiwan’s steadily increasing defense budget, which is dwarfed by China’s even more rapidly increasing military spending, and how it must cover the costs of advanced training and the transition away from military conscription to an all-volunteer force like America’s.

“Altogether, I hope that these actions will ensure that the people of Taiwan remain able to choose our own future free of coercion,” she said.

Tsai made numerous references to Taiwan’s “asymmetrical defense strategy,” a doctrine developed in 2017 that moves away from the earlier “war of attrition” model that assumed China would never pay the cost in manpower necessary to take the island by force. That model assumed a level of overwhelming technological superiority over China that Taiwanese forces no longer enjoy, and China’s advances also make the geography of the Taiwan Strait a less formidable obstacle than it once was.

The asymmetrical defense strategy basically involves hitting a hypothetical Chinese invasion force at its most vulnerable points: blanketing the Taiwan Strait with so many anti-ship missiles that ferrying troops to the island becomes all but impossible, preventing the Chinese air force from attaining the air superiority it would need to shut Taiwan’s anti-ship defense down, and covering key invasion beaches with a blanket of land and sea mines.

Chinese invaders would find themselves facing a frustrating barrage of missiles launched from trucks and small boats that could not be wiped out in a first strike, the beaches would explode when Chinese troops set foot upon them, and invaders who made it past the land mines would find themselves facing powerful M1 Abrams tanks.

The new weapons Taiwan has requested are important for the strategy because the idea is to raise the ante of troops and hardware China would have to land on Taiwan’s beaches to stand a chance against its ground forces. An invasion force that could go toe-to-toe with the Abrams tanks would have to be formidable indeed.

Tsai praised bipartisan congressional support for Taiwan as a sign of the American people’s commitment to the island, a commitment bound to impress Chinese strategists who might otherwise hope the current administration is succeeded by one less invested in protecting Taiwan.

Tsai cited the dismaying example of Hong Kong as a reason why Taiwan could never accept China’s false promise of “one country, two systems.” She called Hong Kong a “deeply concerning case study” for Taiwan.

“It reflects that democracy is inherently incompatible with the Chinese regime, especially the CCP [Chinese Communist Party] system,” she said. “Hong Kong is a reminder that all politicians in Taiwan, regardless of political party, should carefully avoid falling into a trap laid by China which includes economic incentives and other promises, but ultimately leads to the same destination – that is, ‘one country, two systems.’”

“Sooner or later, just like the 1992 Consensus has become ‘one country, two systems,’ that ‘one country, two systems’ will become just one country, which is the example of Hong Kong, and is exactly what Hong Kong is going through right now,” she warned.


General Robert Abrams, the top American commander in South Korea, testified before Congress on Wednesday that North Korea’s recent actions are “inconsistent” with dictator Kim Jong-un’s pledge to dismantle his nuclear missile program.

Gen. Abrams told the House Armed Services Committee that diplomacy with North Korea has “produced a number of nascent confidence-building measures,” including improvements in the security environment along the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), less bellicose rhetoric from Pyongyang, and greatly improved communications between the two Koreas.

“Current modifications in atmospherics, however, do not represent a substantive change in North Korea’s military posture or readiness,” he said. “The North Korean military remains formidable and dangerous, with no discernable differences in the assessed force structure, readiness, or lethality my predecessor reported in 2018.”

Abrams praised the “hard work of diplomacy” and the results achieved thus far, but said he is “clear-eyed about the fact that little to no verifiable change has occurred in North Korea’s conventional and asymmetric capabilities that continue to hold the United States, South Korea, and our regional allies at risk.”

Although he was not at liberty to discuss sensitive intelligence assessments of widely reported satellite photos that show North Korea making improvements to its missile test facilities, Abrams said these activities are “inconsistent with denuclearization.”

Abrams stressed the importance of keeping sufficient U.S. military assets in South Korea to carefully monitor the North and respond quickly to provocations.

The Hill noted on Wednesday that several other defense and intelligence officials have testified there are few indications North Korea is seriously pursuing denuclearization, although it has at least halted nuclear warhead detonations and ballistic missile tests. Most of these experts and officials, including Abrams, said they wanted the Trump administration to continue its diplomatic efforts with Pyongyang.

Assistant Secretary of Defense Randall Schriver testified before the same House committee as Abrams on Wednesday and said he also has “not seen any progress to speak of” on denuclearization.


The five high-risk Taliban commanders released from the U.S. military prison in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, by the previous administration in exchange for Bowe Bergdahl who was captured by the terrorist group after deserting his post in Afghanistan are now reportedly negotiating peace in the war-ravaged country with their former captors.

“During our time in Guantánamo, the feeling was with us that we had been brought there unjustly and that we would be freed,” Mullah Khairullah Khairkhwa, one of the Taliban Five, as the former Gitmo prisoners are now known, told the New York Times (NYT) in an article published Tuesday. “But it never occurred to me that one day there would be negotiations with them, and I would be sitting there with them on one side and us on the other.”

In December 2015, a report issued by the Republican-led House Armed Services Committee and congressional testimony by a U.S. Army lieutenant colonel revealed that multiple alternatives were on the table for former President Barack Obama’s administration despite his Pentagon chief’s assertion that releasing the terrorists was the only option to free the American prisoner.

Bergdahl was later convicted of desertion and misbehavior before the enemy, dishonorably discharged, and demoted to private.

Obama’s own Joint Task Force Guantanamo (JTF-GTMO) deemed each one of the Taliban five as a “high” risk to the United States and its allies.

Furthermore, senior intelligence officials told lawmakers that the top five Taliban commanders— Fazl Mohammad Mazloom, Mohammed Nabi, Abdul Haq Wasiq, Mullah Norullah Nori, and Khairullah Khairkhwa—were likely to return to terrorist activities against the U.S. if they were set free.

NYT does note that at least one of them — Mullah Mazloom — may be guilty of “mass killings and scorched-earth brutality,” adding that it obtained documents under a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request showing that the battle-hardened jihadi “showed no remorse.”

The December 2015 House panel report found that “at least three” of the Taliban fighters have resumed “threatening activities” after being released to Qatar from Guantánamo Bay in May 2014.

So, in a way, the five Taliban narco-jihadis are “lucky” to be sitting across from their captors as part of the terrorist group’s delegation discussing the U.S. military withdrawal to end the more than 17-year-old Afghanistan war.

The Times reported:

Now, in a stark demonstration of the twists and contradictions of the long American involvement in Afghanistan, five of those men are sitting across a negotiating table from their former captors, part of the Taliban team discussing the terms of an American troop withdrawal. …The five senior Taliban officials were held at Guantánamo for 13 years before catching a lucky break in 2014. They were exchanged for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, the only known American service member to be held by the insurgents as a prisoner of war.

Although they Taliban Five were reunited with their families in Qatar, home to the terrorist group’s primary political office, the Qatari authorities continue to keep a watchful eye on the jihadis at the request of the United States, the Times reported.

However, Qatar has long served as a safe haven for the Taliban and other terrorists. According to David Ibsen, the executive director of the non-governmental Counter Extremism Project (CEP), Qatar likely influenced the re-engagement in jihadist activities of some of the Taliban Five.

Taliban leaders made a point of ensuring the former Guantánamo prisoners participate in the ongoing negotiations in recent months.

Trump administration officials have intensified peace negotiations with the group in recent months, angering Afghan President Ashraf Ghani’s team, which has so far not been allowed to participate in the discussions at the behest of the Taliban.

The Taliban — which has stepped up the fight to implement strict Islamic laws or sharia amid the negotiations — considers itself the only legitimate government, dismissing the Ghani administration as an American “puppet.”

Taliban narco-terrorists claim they will only talk to Kabul after the complete withdrawal of foreign forces.

The latest round of negotiations, which ended March 12, did yield two draft agreements — the eventual U.S. military withdrawal and counterterrorism assurances by the Taliban jihadis who do not believe themselves to be terrorists.

“During days of slow and at times frustrated discussions at the most recent session, which ended on March 12, it was the Taliban side that was often more emotional. Some gave impassioned speeches about how vital it was that the Americans completely leave Afghanistan in as little as six months,” the Times noted.

Besides Mullah Khairkhwa, the other Taliban Five members appeared reluctant to speak, NYT acknowledged.

The Taliban has rejected a reported offer by the Trump Pentagon of pulling out American troops within three to five years. Taliban jihadis had also repudiated the Trump administration’s proposal to leave behind a residual force to make sure the terrorists keep their promise of ensuring Afghanistan does not once again harbor international terrorists like it did with al-Qaeda when it was under the Taliban regime right before the September 11 attacks on the U.S. homeland.

It was the Taliban’s decision to shelter al-Qaeda that triggered the longest American war to date.


Documents unsealed by a Spanish court on Tuesday shed new light on a strange incident from February in which a mysterious group of armed individuals attacked the North Korean embassy in Madrid. The perpetrators have been revealed as members of a cultish group called Cheollima Civil Defense that appears dedicated to avenging the murder of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un’s half-brother, Kim Jong-nam.

Cheollima Civil Defense, also known as “Free Joseon,” announced itself with a 2017 communique that cited the murder of Kim Jong-nam in Malaysia. The infamous killing was carried out with a nerve agent spread on the victim’s face by two women who claim they were duped by North Korean agents into believing they were playing a harmless prank for a TV show. Charges were abruptly dropped against one of the women in March, while the trial of the other has been put on hold until April.

The Cheollima Civil Defense group, which takes its name from a mythical winged horse that often figures in North Korean propaganda, announced it was protecting Kim Jong-nam’s son Kim Han-sol from death at the hands of North Korean agents. (The other name often used by the group, “The Provisional Government of Free Joseon,” is a reference to the 14th Century Korean dynasty that contributed much of modern Korean culture.)

The group was never particularly secretive, boasting a website and YouTube channel upon which Kim Han-sol has appeared, but it remained enigmatic over the past two years, possibly because it wasn’t taken very seriously. Describing itself as a human rights organization committed to assisting defectors and hastening the end of the brutal Kim dynasty in North Korea, its activities mostly consisted of blogging, urging North Koreans to defy their dictatorship, and spray-painting its logo on whatever North Korean property it could gain access to, including the wall of the embassy in Madrid.

In March, Cheollima Civil Defense declared itself to be the legitimate interim government of North Korea, a “single and just organization” reflecting the will of the people.

Next came the bizarre attack on the North Korean embassy in Madrid, carried out a few days before U.S. President Donald Trump held his second summit with Kim Jong-un in Hanoi, Vietnam. According to the newly-unsealed Spanish court documents, ten members of Cheollima Civil Defense stormed the facility by pretending to visit on legitimate business and producing weapons once they were inside. The group claims the intruders used fake guns and never had any intention of seriously harming anyone, although court documents indicate they were also armed with very real knives, machetes, and metal clubs.

The intruders took embassy staffers prisoner with shackles, beat some of them, and occupied the facility for about five hours. They took the North Korean attache down to the basement and unsuccessfully tried to persuade him to defect. They filmed themselves smashing portraits of the previous North Korean dictators, Kim Jong-il and Kim Il-sung, and uploaded the video to YouTube.

Another hostage escaped from the building and screamed for help, prompting worried neighbors to call the police. When the police arrived, Cheollima Civil Defense leader Adrian Hong Chang met them at the front door wearing a Kim Jong-un badge on his lapel, convinced them he was an embassy official, and talked them into leaving without investigating any further.

The intruders ultimately escaped in several stolen embassy vehicles, taking computers and data discs from the embassy with them. Chang, a Mexican national who lives in the United States, reportedly escaped through Portugal, flew to New Jersey, contacted the FBI, and offered to hand over the materials he seized from the Madrid embassy.

Members of Cheollima Civil Defense made statements implying they have some relationship with the U.S. government, which supposedly teamed up with China and the Netherlands to help them get Kim Han-sol to safety after his father’s murder. Spanish media buzzed with rumors that the embassy attack team had military training and two of its members are linked to the American CIA, possibly tasked with finding information about the former North Korean ambassador to Spain and his ties to Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons program. The former ambassador, Kim Hyok-chol, was involved in organizing the Hanoi summit.

The FBI refused to comment on the matter on Tuesday after the Spanish court documents were unsealed, while a State Department spokesman insisted, “The United States government had nothing to do with this.”

A second member of the team that attacked the North Korean embassy was identified as an American citizen named Sam Ruy, while a third was said to be a South Korean named Woo Ran Lee.

Cheollima Civil Defense posted a message on its website Tuesday insisting it does not work for any single government, but it claimed it did share information seized during the Madrid raid with the FBI “under mutually agreed terms of confidentiality.”

“This information was shared voluntarily and on their request, not our own. Those terms appear to have been broken,” the statement said, essentially blaming its putative FBI contacts for leaking information to the media. The group complained that secrecy is essential to its survival and exposing the identity of any member could put others, along with family members in North Korea, at risk.

The group claimed it did not “attack” the Madrid embassy at all, and contrary to the Spanish court documents, it said its team did not carry weapons of any kind. It claimed it was invited into the embassy in response to some “urgent situation.”

“Out of respect for the host nation of Spain, no weapons were used. All occupants in the embassy were treated with dignity and necessary caution,” the statement claimed.

Cheollima Civil Defense concluded its statement by railing against the North Korean regime, accusing it of using its embassies as “hubs of illicit narcotics and arms trafficking” as well as “launchpads for global cyber attacks and thefts, assassinations, kidnapping, and hostage-taking.”

The Spanish court filing indicated police believe all ten of the embassy attackers fled to the United States, from which Spain might seek permission to extradite them. Former U.S. State Department official Lee Wolosky, retained by the group as its legal counsel, dismissed Spanish national court judge Jose de la Mata as “inaccurate and uninformed” about the true nature of Cheollima Civil Defense, which he said is primarily involved in helping defectors flee North Korea.

The court indicated no police reports have been filed by the North Korean government or any of the hostages, which partially accounts for the low media profile of the embassy attack. Another possible reason is embarrassment by the Spanish government over the inadequate police response to the incident and the attackers’ easy escape – or, if the more conspiratorial versions of the story are to be believed, the Spanish government tacitly facilitated the raid and allowed the attackers to get away.

Some theorize the group broke into the North Korean embassy on a mission to grab sensitive material it could sell to foreign governments in order to finance its activities, while others see them as a renegade group of North Korean defectors seeking to disrupt diplomacy between the Kim regime, South Korea, and the United States.

Cheollima Civil Defense presents itself as a tiny rebellion seeking to overthrow an evil empire.

“The struggle we are engaged in with the incumbent regime is not a political race between equals, but a small revolutionary group, fighting and resisting a totalitarian regime that maintains concentration camps, keeps its people enslaved, and regularly kills its opponents and their families,” the group stated on its website.


Beijing Kunlun Tech Co Ltd, the Chinese company that owns popular gay dating app Grindr, is reportedly looking to sell the app based on the U.S. government calling it a “national security risk.”

According to Reuters, the company is looking to sell Grindr, which it acquired between 2016 and 2018, “after a U.S. government national security panel raised concerns about its ownership.”

“The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has informed Kunlun that its ownership of West Hollywood, California-based Grindr constitutes a national security risk,” Reuters reported, adding that, “Grindr has hired investment bank Cowen Inc to handle the sale process, and is soliciting acquisition interest from U.S. investment firms, as well as Grindr’s competitors.”

The Chinese company’s acquisition of Grindr proved to be very controversial, sparking privacy fears.

In 2017, Grindr assured users that the Chinese government would “not have access to your account,” and declared, “We want to keep it real with you (and we don’t want anyone spreading crazy conspiracy theories), so here’s what you need to know… Your privacy remains paramount. Nothing changes with how we will protect your personal information.”

“The Chinese government will not have access to your account,” the company claimed. “Beijing Kunlun is not owned by the Chinese government. This sale doesn’t change how Grindr safeguards our user data.”

However, the Daily Mail at the time warned that “some cybersecurity experts aren’t so sure,” noting “that the Chinese government is able to exert significant pressure and control on the country’s private enterprises.”

The Washington Post‘s Josh Rogin also warned, “Grindr’s assurances notwithstanding… the risk to Grindr users that the Chinese government will know their secrets has just increased.”

In 2018, it was reported that Grindr had allegedly been sharing the HIV statuses of its users with third parties.

In the same year, the president of Grindr, Scott Chen, also faced controversy for claiming marriage is “between a man and a woman.”


Brunei’s already strict Islamic criminal code will enter an even tougher new stage next week with the introductions of laws mandating lengthy prison terms, whipping, and even execution for homosexual behavior. Brunei is set to become the first Asian country to punish homosexuality with the death penalty, as several Arab countries do.

Brunei began imposing sharia law with a three-stage process in 2014. The first stage criminalized Christmas celebrations, getting pregnant out of wedlock, and failing to attend Muslim prayer services. Homosexuality was also criminalized, but the penalty in Stage One of the sharia revolution was merely 10 years in prison.

The sultanate disregarded five years of criticism from international human rights groups and quietly issued court orders to proceed with Stage Two on April 3. Gays will be whipped, imprisoned for much longer sentences, and could be executed by stoning, although Brunei has recently been lax about actually carrying out death sentences.

Another perennial sharia favorite, cutting of the hands of thieves, is included in the upgraded legal code. According to Amnesty International, many of these harsh penalties with be applicable to children.

“Brunei must immediately halt its plans to implement these vicious punishments and revise its Penal Code in compliance with its human rights obligations. The international community must urgently condemn Brunei’s move to put these cruel penalties into practice,” Amnesty International researcher Rachel Chhoa-Howard said on Wednesday.

Reuters reported on Monday that the new laws are being “fast-tracked” after a period of hesitation on the part of the sultanate. There has been little in the way of a formal announcement, and the prime minister’s office has not responded to media inquiries. This week’s outraged responses from human rights groups were based largely on researchers uncovering government documents ordering implementation of the new punishments to begin in April.

“We are trying to get pressure placed on the government of Brunei but realize there is a very short time frame until the laws take effect. It took us by surprise that the government has now given a date and is rushing through implementation,” said Australian activist Matthew Woolfe of The Brunei Project. His reaction suggests the fast track was chosen so that critics would be caught off guard.

Channel News Asia suggested on Wednesday that Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah might be embracing hard line sharia law as an exercise in virtue-signaling, shoring up his Islamic bona fides after a lifetime of conspicuous consumption and some family scandals:

Brunei’s Sultan is no stranger to controversy at home – the monarchy was deeply embarrassed by a family feud with his brother Jefri over the latter’s alleged embezzlement of US$15 billion during his tenure as finance minister in the 1990s. Court battles and investigations revealed salacious details of Jefri’s jetset lifestyle, including claims of a high-priced harem of foreign women and a luxury yacht he owned called “Tits”.

Human Rights Campaign director Ty Cobb called on the Trump administration to take a public stand against Brunei’s legal code:

We are facing a dangerous crisis as Brunei is close to implementing laws that impose state-sponsored torture and murder of LGBTQ people. It’s absolutely crucial that the international community speak out now and demand that the Sultan of Brunei stop these barbaric changes that threaten the lives of Brunei citizens. The Trump-Pence Administration must also immediately make clear that these outrageous human rights abuses will not be tolerated.

The Trump State Department expressed concerns about the direction of Brunei’s legal system in 2017, noting the laws criticized as anti-gay could technically impose death by stoning against heterosexual couples for engaging in “carnal intercourse against the order of nature.” The State Department noted numerous reports of discrimination from gays and lesbians in Brunei, including intimidation by the police.


China’s “social credit” system–a dystopian surveillance nightmare that monitors people in countless ways and automatically dishes out punishments for poor citizenship and political dissidence–is humiliating “discredited individuals” by forcing them to use an embarrassing ringtone on their cell phones.

The South China Morning Post reported on Tuesday that most people with low social credit scores were labeled “discredited” or “deadbeats” because they have debt problems. The most widely reported punishment meted out by the computerized system is restricted travel privileges. Many of the subjects learn they have slipped into the worst category, known as laolai, when they attempt to board an airplane and are turned away at the gate.

The SCMP pointed out that many other indignities are heaped upon the laolai, such as forcing them to ride on special slow trains, banning them from renting hotel rooms–and, most bizarrely, forcing them to use a special ringtone that embarrasses them every time they receive a phone call in public.

Australia’s ABC News said the ringtone sounds like a siren and is accompanied by a verbal message cautioning callers to be “careful in their business dealings” with the alleged deadbeat.

ABC News reported on another over-the-top aspect of the social credit system: an app running on WeChat that generates a map with a radar-style graphic overlay that “pings” every laolai around the user. The app is commonly known as the “Deadbeat Map.”

As of January, the system appeared to be displaying the registered home addresses of people with low credit scores, but there is no reason it could not be upgraded to show their current live locations based on their cell phones and other information gathered by the increasingly inescapable Chinese surveillance system.

“Tapping on a person marked on the map reveals their personal information, including their full name, court case number and the reason they have been labeled untrustworthy. Identity card numbers and home addresses are also partially shown,” ABC reported.

For the benefit of anyone still foolish enough to believe there is meaningful separation between the totalitarian Chinese Communist government and “private” Chinese business enterprises, WeChat management insisted the Deadbeat Map is totally compliant with its user privacy and data security standards. It is an app that will display extensive personal information to complete strangers if the government decides to lower one’s “social credit” score below a certain threshold–a decision citizens are not always informed of in a timely manner, but it’s no problem at all for WeChat’s privacy standards.

A “discredited individual” named David Kong, who was recently forced onto a 30-hour train ride because his low social credit score barred him from taking a three-hour trip by airplane, told the South China Morning Post that being a laolai is worse than serving time in prison.

“Being on the list means that as long as you can’t clear your debts in full, your name will always be there,” he said.

Kong went on to explain that not only was the 30-hour train ride uncomfortable, but the business associates who picked him up at the railroad station instantly knew he had a low social credit score. He noted this aspect of the system creates a downward spiral where people with debt problems cannot make business deals or land good jobs to earn the money they need to address their financial situation. His creditors essentially told the SCMP that he deserves his fate because he went into debt taking out loans for a sham book publishing company.

Kong actually wanted to make the social credit system more extensive by adding more inputs that would help “deadbeats” repair their reputations by doing community service and engaging in responsible activities. According to ABC, the engineers of the Orwellian system are thinking more in terms of adding more ways to reduce social credit scores:

One private credit system using data from Alibaba rates people not only on their financial capacity but also on their consumer choices. The example Sesame Credit technology director Li Yingyun gave Chinese media is that a person who buys nappies regularly is responsible, while someone who plays video games all day would be considered lazy.

Getting kicked off an airplane because the national computer system decides you play too many video games sounds like a satire of dystopian science fiction, but it is actually a logical progression of the system, whose stated goal is to increase “social dependability”–in other words, the old Communist ideal of hard-working, obedient, politically reliable subjects.

Any American tempted to laugh at the absurdity of the Chinese system should pause to reflect that most of the data processing capacity and raw information to inflict such a system on Americans is already in place. It is not difficult to imagine a “Medicare for All” socialized medicine system that monitors how much time its captive subjects spend playing video games versus healthy fitness activity and adjusts their mandatory “contributions” accordingly.


The U.S. trade deficit fell by nearly 15 percent in January as higher tariffs held back imports from China and the price of oil fell.

The deficit in goods and services dropped to $51.1 billion from a revised $59.9 billion in December, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. That was the narrowest trade gap in five months and smaller than the $57.3 billion economists expected.

The trade deficits in goods with China fell to $33.2 billion as imports from the nation plunged 12.3 percent.

Imports subtract from gross domestic product because U.S. incomes are spent on production abroad. So the smaller deficit could provide a lift to first-quarter economic growth.

The U.S. tends to run a deficit in goods and a surplus in services, meaning we import more goods than we export but export more services than we import. The goods deficit narrowed to $73.3 billion in January, while the surplus in services climbed slightly to $22.1 billion.

A ten percent tariff on $200 billion of Chinese goods was imposed at the end of September and was set to rise to 25 percent on January 1. Nonetheless, the trade deficit hit the highest level in a decade in December, suggesting that importers had rushed to bring in goods from China ahead of the hike to 25 percent.

Some highlights:

Soybean exports rose more than 400 percent to $1.21 billion in January. Compared with a year earlier, soybean exports were up 50 percent. This rise may reflect increased purchases by China after the country promised to buy more U.S. agricultural products as part of the trade deal it is trying to strike with the Trump administration.

The cost of imported oil fell to the lowest level in three years.

Exports of U.S. cars and auto parts rose by $1.2 billion.

Exports of civilian aircraft fell $1.3 billion.

For the year, the trade deficit in 2018 rose $621 billion, the highest level in 10 years. That was largely due to a strengthened U.S. economy that boosted U.S. domestic demand and global economic weakening that depressed demand for U.S. exports. Retaliatory tariffs from China also weighed on some U.S. exports.

The January data was delayed for three weeks because of the partial government shutdown.


A former Chinese central banker described U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and other U.S. trade negotiators as “a team of barking dogs,” the South China Morning Post reported Tuesday.

The criticism of the U.S. officials came from Tsinghua University’s economics professor David Li Daokui, a former member of the monetary policy committee of the People’s Bank of China, according to the SCMP report. Li was speaking at Credit Suisse’s Asia Investment Conference in Hong Kong.

Li said the U.S. side was “perceived to be overly aggressive, unnecessarily aggressive by the Chinese general public.”

“You have to show respect. Otherwise it does not work,” Li said.

Li also revealed China’s tactic was to attempt to wait out President Trump’s team by allowing negotiations to stall-out and tariffs to rise.

From the South China Morning Post:

“China was patient, and was not eager to reach a deal in [the period between] May and November” last year, Li said at Credit Suisse’s Asia Investment Conference in Hong Kong, recounting a December 2018 phone call with the Chinese head of state Xi Jinping. “Let’s see who blinks first,” he recalled Xi as saying.

Li also recounted the prediction by Xi that Trump would fail in his attempts to reform U.S. politics and trade deals.

“We are prepared for this new president to create trouble,” Xi said, according to Li. “He is new, from outside political institutions. He does not believe in a lot of things. He will try, but he will be burnt.”

Ambassador Lighthizer is scheduled to travel with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to Beijing this week to meet with counterparts in hopes of hammering out a preliminary trade deal within the next two weeks.


WASHINGTON, DC — U.S. President Donald Trump “may have avoided getting entrapped into a bad deal” by refusing to accept dictator Kim Jong-un’s scant denuclearization offer in exchange for major sanctions relief at the second unprecedented summit with North Korea earlier this year, a renowned expert on negotiations with the rogue regime told lawmakers Tuesday.

Dr. Victor Cha, who served in the George W. Bush White House and is now the Korea chair at the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS), testified before the Senate Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on East Asia and the Pacific alongside Kelly Magsamen from the liberal Center for American Progress (CAP).

Both experts discussed U.S. policy towards North Korea following the second summit that failed to convince the regime to take credible steps towards the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean peninsula in exchange for relief from crippling economic sanctions and security guarantees.

The two unprecedented meetings between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader — at Singapore in June 2018 and in Vietnam in late February 2019 — failed to deliver an agreement on denuclearization.

Moreover, Cha and Magsamen determined North Korea has continued its nuclear activities despite the negotiations, echoing recent U.S. intelligence assessments. Both experts, however, conceded the Trump administration’s economic pressure campaign is having an impact on the negotiations, citing Kim’s insistence on getting sanctions relief. The two experts believe the sanctions have granted the Trump administration “leverage” in the U.S.-North Korea talks.

Despite acknowledging that the economic pressure campaign on Kim is bearing fruit, the CAP expert urged the Trump administration in her written testimony to “explore what limited sanctions relief might support an interim agreement without necessarily removing leverage.”

“I want to be clear at the outset that I am a strong supporter of diplomacy with North Korea, but I want to also be clear that I think the Administration is doing it wrong,” Magsamen stated.

In his written testimony, Cha, who also serves as a professor at Georgetown University, declared:

The president indeed may have avoided getting entrapped into a bad deal at Hanoi. What North Korea put on the table in terms of the Yongbyon nuclear complex is a fraction of their growing nuclear program that does not even break the surface of their underlying arsenal and stockpiles of fissile materials, not to mention missile bases and delivery systems. And what they sought in return, in terms of major sanctions relief on five UN Security Council resolutions that target ninety percent of their trade, would have removed one of the primary sources of leverage, albeit imperfect, on the regime. In this instance, no deal was better than a bad deal.

Dictator Kim has reportedly offered to demolish the Yongbyon nuclear plant and other facilities for making nuclear-bomb fuel. Nevertheless, Kim has continued to enrich uranium at the plant following his first summit with Trump last June.

Trump expressed disappointment at reports of ongoing missile and potential nuclear activity in North Korea.

Consistent with Cha’s position, the CAP expert noted, “In the case of the Hanoi summit, many of us were worried about the possibility of a bad deal. The good news is that this did not happen. The bad news is that the way forward is now deeply uncertain and full of risks.”

Both Dr. Cha and Magsamen noted that the Hanoi summit had left the United States with an uncertain road ahead on the ongoing menace posed by North Korea’s nuclear ambitions, considered by the American military to be one of the top threats facing the United States.

“When leaders’ summits fail to reach [an] agreement, diplomacy by definition has reached the end of its rope…the failed summit leaves a great deal of uncertainty going forward,” Cha noted.

Unlike his predecessors, President Trump has refused to budge an inch on sanctions relief, vowing to maintain economic pressure on the regime until it takes steps towards denuclearization.

Before the first summit in Singapore, the administration made it clear the U.S. president was prepared to “walk away” if presented with a bad deal. In the wake of the second meeting with Kim, Trump said, “Sometimes you have to walk, and this was just one of those times.”

Magsamen from the liberal CAP think-tank urged the Trump administration to agree to “temporary and proportional sanctions relief’ for North Korea, adding:

It will be important to ensure that UN sanctions that deal directly with North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic programs remain in place. However, the Administration can look to temporary and proportional sanctions relief – through waivers and exemptions — with built-in snap-back provisions to incentivize North Korea to not just take but sustain increasingly meaningful steps.

She urged the administration to model its agreement after former President Barack Obama’s failed Iran nuclear pact, from which Trump pulled the United States out, arguing that it was not working.

Echoing the CAP expert, Cha told lawmakers he does not think the uncertainty generated by the summits “will mean a return to the ‘fire and fury’ days of 2017 when armed conflict was possible.”

In August 2017, Trump threatened to take military action against North Korea if it endangered the United States.

Magsamen told the Senate panel on Tuesday:

After two U.S.-North Korea summits in Singapore and Hanoi, North Korea still has upwards of 60 nuclear weapons and is continuing to accumulate fissile material to make more. It retains the ballistic missile capability to threaten Hawaii, Alaska, the West Coast, and of course, our ally Japan and has proven the capability to range most of the continental United States. And North Korea retains a conventional capacity to put South Korea at unacceptable risk. In sum, the threat has not changed. …And while better than the days of “fire and fury,” this problem is not going to be solved through reality TV episodes. It’s going to take deliberate, integrated and coherent interagency effort in close partnership with the international community.

Both Cha and Magsamen noted that the U.S. must include human rights in the ongoing negotiations, acknowledging that the Trump administration has taken some steps to apply pressure on the regime regarding human rights.

“Human rights continue to be neglected in the administration’s summit diplomacy with North Korea… It is impossible for U.S. denuclearization diplomacy to succeed without integration of the human rights issue,” the CSIS expert told lawmakers.


Chinese Premier Xi Jinping and French President Emmanuel Macron signed a range of deals worth billions of Euros on Monday, although the latter pushed back against Beijing’s proposed ‘Belt and Road’ infrastructure initiative.

During Xi Jinping’s visit to France on Monday, the two sides signed 15 separate deals worth €40 billion (US$45 billion), including an order for 300 of France’s Airbus planes, matching a similar purchase he made of 300 Boeing aircraft from the U.S. during his visit to Washington last November. Other deals everything from the renewable energy sector to shipping and banking, while Xi also agreed to lift China’s embargo on French poultry.

However, Macron was unwilling to sign up to China’s ambitious ‘Belt and Silk Road’ initiative, citing concerns that it would not benefit the French economy and increase their own trade deficit with the world’s second-largest economy.

“Europe must be united and have a coherent message,” Macron said at a joint press conference following their talks at the Elysee Palace. “That’s what we are doing on strategic investment.”

Macron’s refusal to sign up to the ‘Belt and Road’ came just a day after Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte agreed to sign Italy up to the initiative, further exacerbating the divide between Macron’s globalist vision and Italy’s populist administration.

“Our goal with these accords is to start to rebalance an imbalance for which there is a lot of ‘Made in China’ coming to Italy and too little ‘Made in Italy’ that goes to China,” Italy’s Minister for Economic Development Luigi Di Maio said. “We now expect a substantial and gradual increase of exports and we hope that in the next years we can balance out the trade imbalances.”

Following his meetings with Macron, President Xi argued that such initiatives would benefit all parties and lead to “win-win outcomes.”

“China is willing to work with France to inherit the past and create the future, enable our close and enduring comprehensive strategic partnership to continue leading the way, and make more historic contributions to building an open, inclusive, clean and beautiful world that enjoys lasting peace, universal security, and common prosperity,” he said.

“Under the new situation, the two sides should do much better in those three aspects, and continue to explore the way for major countries to get along with each other, which should feature independence, mutual understanding, foresight, mutual benefit, and win-win outcomes,” Xi continued. “In politics, we should not only build a strong ‘dam’ of mutual trust, but also a ‘lighthouse’ of ideal.”

Taiwanese computer hardware company ASUS has confirmed reports claiming that the company was used by hackers to install backdoors on customers’ computers.

On Monday, Vice’s Motherboard reported that hackers used ASUS to push “malware to hundreds of thousands of customers through its trusted automatic software update tool,” and on Tuesday, ASUS confirmed the report in a statement.

“A small number of devices have been implanted with malicious code through a sophisticated attack on our Live Update servers in an attempt to target a very small and specific user group. ASUS customer service has been reaching out to affected users and providing assistance to ensure that the security risks are removed,” declared ASUS.

“ASUS has also implemented a fix in the latest version (ver. 3.6.8) of the Live Update software, introduced multiple security verification mechanisms to prevent any malicious manipulation in the form of software updates or other means, and implemented an enhanced end-to-end encryption mechanism.”

“At the same time, we have also updated and strengthened our server-to-end-user software architecture to prevent similar attacks from happening in the future,” the company continued, adding, “Additionally, we have created an online security diagnostic tool to check for affected systems, and we encourage users who are still concerned to run it as a precaution.”

Though ASUS claimed that only “a very small number of specific user group were found to have been targeted by this attack and as such it is extremely unlikely that your device has been targeted,” the company recommended those affected to backup their files and then restore their device to factory settings.


Australia could jail Big Tech company executives who fail to remove extremist content from their platforms, according to a report.

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison is reportedly meeting with Google, Facebook, and Twitter executives on Tuesday to discuss proposed legislation which would threaten Big Tech company CEOs with prison if they fail to combat “extremist material” on their platforms.

The Australian Financial Review reported, Tuesday, that under “proposed laws, it would become a criminal offence if a social media company failed to remove footage as soon as possible after it was reported or otherwise becoming known to the content hosts that offending footage was distributed on their platform.”

“The laws would also allow the government to declare footage of an incident filmed by a perpetrator and being hosted on a content site was ‘abhorrent violent material’, and create a separate offence if it were not rapidly removed,” the Australian Financial Review explained, adding that “individual social media executives based in Australia would face the risk of penalties, including jail time.”

In a statement, Morrison declared, “If social media companies fail to demonstrate a willingness to immediately institute changes to prevent the use of their platforms, like what was filmed and shared by the perpetrators of the terrible offences in Christchurch, we will take action.”

“We are considering all options to keep Australian safe,” he continued.

New Zealand recently banned the Christchurch mosque shooter’s manifesto, ordering citizens to destroy any copies they possess.

Those caught possessing or sharing the manifesto could face a lengthy prison sentence, while one 22-year-old accused of sharing a video of the massacre online faces up to ten years in prison.

Following the shooting, most major internet service providers in New Zealand also banned websites which hosted the video of the massacre, and Reddit banned two “gore” subreddits.

Social networks reportedly struggled to remove copies of the video following the attack, however, Facebook rejected calls for the platform to implement a television-style live video delay, claiming it would only create a longer response time for police to respond to incidents.


Google requested a meeting with the U.S.’s top general, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, after he called the tech company out for conducting work that directly benefitted China’s military, while refusing to work with the U.S. military.

“The general is tentatively scheduled to meet with a senior Google official in Washington DC at Google’s request,” said Dunford’s spokesman, Air Force Col. Pat Ryder in an email on Thursday.

Dunford first revealed the meeting during a discussion on Thursday at the Atlantic Council, where he was speaking about great power competition with China and Russia.

He also revealed that a Google representative was attending his talk and planned to meet with him at a luncheon hosted by the Atlantic Council.

“I think I have a meeting next week. And I think I might have one at lunch here today. I think somebody’s here from Google. And I’m happy to have that debate,” he said.

Google’s offensive comes after Dunford criticized the company during a high-profile hearing with the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier this month, in response to a question from Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO).

“The work that Google is doing in China is … indirectly benefitting the Chinese military,” Dunford said. “We watch with great concern when industry partners work in China knowing that there is that indirect benefit. And frankly, ‘indirect’ may be not a full characterization of the way it really is, it’s more of a direct benefit to the Chinese military.”

Last June, Google canceled a project working with the Pentagon to help develop artificial intelligence capabilities due to concerns from employees that their work could go towards warfighting in the future. However, earlier that year in January, Google opened an artificial intelligence research center in Beijing.

Google has also faced criticism after secret plans for creating a censored search engine for China were leaked to The Intercept. Google has reportedly shelved those plans.

Dunford remained unflinching in his criticism at the Atlantic Council, though he broadened that criticism to U.S. technology companies that conduct work benefitting China and did not specifically target Google.

He said historically, U.S. industry has helped give the U.S. military a competitive advantage, by allowing it to tap into intellectual capital of the American people, innovation, and production.

He said Chinese President Xi Jinping is trying to do the same thing and break down barriers between the military and industry in China. Thus, he said, high-tech U.S. firms doing business in China are ultimately handing over intellectual property not only to the company, but to the Chinese military.

“Typically, if a company does business in China, they’re automatically going to be required to have a cell of the Communist party in that company. And that is going to lead to that intellectual property from that company finding its way to the Chinese military. It’s a distinction without a difference between the Chinese Communist Party, the government and the Chinese military,” he said.

He said the problem with helping China develop its artificial intelligence in China is that it would help its authoritarian government assert control over its own population and enable the Chinese military to take advantage of the technology that is developed in the U.S.

He said he highlighted Google at the hearing due to its artificial intelligence venture in China.

“I think it’s a reasonable assertion even an open venue like this, to assert that the benefit of that venture for artificial intelligence in China, it’s one of many ventures of our companies that are there, indirectly benefits the Chinese military and creates a challenge for us in maintaining a competitive advantage,” he said.

“This is not about me and Google. This is about us looking at the second and third order effects of our business ventures in China, Chinese former government, and the impact it’s going to have on the United States’s ability to maintain a competitive military advantage and all that goes with that,” he added.

Dunford also later expressed concerns about allies who are signing contracts with Chinese companies like Huawei to develop their 5G networks — which U.S. national security officials and experts fear could later be compromised by China.

“Inside the Pentagon, we certainly look at that as a critical national security issue,” he said. “I’ve talked recently about to my counterparts is that you know, our relationships rely on trust.”

“And so whether it’s 5G or not, today or in the future, our ability, our willingness to exchange information, intelligence with a partner, is going to be based on their ability to protect that information and it’s going to be based on the information assurance of the systems that we’re using,” he said.

“This is why I think American industry needs to step out and dominate 5G because it’ll be in our national interest to do so.”


Taliban narco-jihadis killed at least 68 members of the U.S.-backed Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) and injured 38 others in fierce clashes over the weekend in the terrorist group’s opium-rich stronghold of Helmand, Afghanistan’s largest province located along the Pakistani border.

According to the New York Times (NYT), the fatalities accounted for the ANDSF’s “worst loss of the year.”

While Voice of America (VOA) noted that the “predawn” attack took place on Saturday, NYT reported that it took place the previous day.

The Taliban has intensified deadly attacks against American troops and members of the ANDSF, which includes military and army units, as U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration boosted peace-seeking efforts in recent months.

Acknowledging that a military victory is unattainable, Trump administration officials have made the negotiated reconciliation between the Afghan government and the Taliban the primary goal of its strategy to end the war — raging since October 2001.

This month peace negotiations have yielded two draft agreements — the eventual U.S. military withdrawal and Taliban assurances that Afghanistan will no longer harbor international terrorists. However, the narco-jihadi group continues to refuse to agree to a ceasefire and allow Kabul to participate in the ongoing negotiations with the Trump administration.

Over the weekend, Taliban jihadis launched an attack on “several security outposts” in Helmand province, the terrorist group’s stronghold, VOA reported.

“Several outposts were captured and looted by insurgents,” Hajji Dawoud Shah, the head of Helmand’s Sangin district where the attack took place, told the Times.

“All three posts were wiped out by the Taliban, none of the forces in them survived,” Mira Jan Akka, a tribal elder from Sangin, added, echoing Shah.

Sen. Mohammed Hashim Alokozai who represents the Helmand district and sits on the Afghan parliament’s defense panel told VOA the Taliban assault “killed at least 65 pro-government forces, including 48 Afghan National Army (ANA) personnel, and injured 38 others.”

NYT placed the estimated number of injuries at up to 43.

“The clashes were still continuing in the area,” he added, VOA noted on Sunday.

On Monday, Khaama Press (KP), citing the Helmand government, reported that airstrikes killed the shadow intelligence for Sangin district recently appointed by the Taliban along with fiver other jihadis.

“More than 20 Taliban fighters have been killed in Helmand in the last week,” KP noted.

A spokesman for the Taliban acknowledged that the terrorist group overran two bases in Helmand and killed at least 52 soldiers over the weekend.

Helmand and neighboring Kandahar, the Taliban’s birthplace, are considered two of the bloodiest provinces for U.S. troops and their allies.

According to the United Nations, they are also the two top opium-producing provinces in Afghanistan, the world’s number one supplier of opium and heroin despite nearly $9 billion in American taxpayer funds devoted to counternarcotics in the South Asian country since the conflict started.

Taliban jihadis generate most of their funding from trafficking and cultivating opium, the primary ingredient in deadly heroin that is making its way onto American streets where it is fueling the unprecedented number of lethal drug overdoses.

According to the U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), a watchdog agency, the Taliban controls the vast majority of Helmand.

“Hilmand remained the country’s leading opium poppy cultivating province, followed by Kandahar, Uruzgan, and Nangarhar,” the U.N. reported in November 2018.

It remains unclear whether the United States will push the Taliban to cut its ties with opium and heroin.

The Trump administration quietly ended its much-touted counter-opium airstrike campaign in recent months after SIGAR criticized the approach as too expensive, noting that it only takes the jihadis a few days to replace the destroyed heroin labs.

The Pentagon has long accused Pakistan of harboring the Afghan Taliban, an allegation denied by Islamabad. Trump administration officials have recently credited Pakistan with using its influence over the Taliban to convince the group to engage in peace negotiations with the United States.

VOA noted:

The Taliban has conducted big attacks in other Afghan provinces this month, killing dozens of police and soldiers. Clashes with the insurgents in northern Kunduz province on Friday also killed two American soldiers, according to the U.S. military. Pro-government forces in Afghanistan have suffered heavy casualties in recent years while battling the Taliban. But Afghan officials have been barred from releasing battlefield casualty information to media since 2017.

Nevertheless, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani revealed in January that predominantly Taliban terrorists had killed 45,000 ANDSF members since he took office in September 2014 alone.

Taliban narco-jihadis and the United States are expected to reconvene peace negotiations later this month in Qatar.

The Helmand attack marked the second large scale attack at the hands of the Taliban in less than a month.

On March 17, Taliban terrorists captured at least 58 members of the ANDSF and killed an estimated 16 others in Afghanistan’s Badghis province located along the country’s border with Turkmenistan.


The U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) over the weekend identified the two American soldiers killed on Saturday by an alleged “Taliban insider” donning an Afghan military uniform as the United States and the narco-jihadi group continue peace negotiations to end the more than 17-year-old war in Afghanistan.

On Saturday, the Pentagon revealed:

Spc. Joseph P. Collette, 29, of Lancaster, Ohio. Collette was assigned to the 242nd Ordnance Battalion, 71st Explosive Ordnance Disposal [EOD) Group, Fort Carson, Colorado. Sgt. 1st Class Will D. Lindsay, 33, of Cortez, Colorado. Lindsay was assigned to 2nd Battalion, 10th Special Forces Group (Airborne), Fort Carson, Colorado.

“Both soldiers died March 22, 2019, in Kunduz Province, Afghanistan, as a result of wounds sustained while engaged in combat operations,” DOD noted.

“The incident is under investigation,” it continued, without elaborating further.

Citing Afghan officials on the day of the incident, the New York Times (NYT) reported that a “Taliban insider” in Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) attire “deliberately provoked the attack” by opening fire from a security checkpoint on the late U.S. Green Beret, EOD tech, and their Afghan special forces counterparts around 3 a.m. on Saturday as they

The incident triggered a firefight between U.S. troops and Afghan soldiers stationed at the nearby outpost the Times learned from Mohammed Ibrahim, the commander of Afghan Local Police in Kunduz Province, “who described it as an accident set off by the insider who first opened fire.” ANDSF troops include military and police units.

“The combined Afghan and coalition ground force was fired on by an unknown assailant at close range from the checkpoint as well as from two other directions,” Sgt. 1st Class Debra Richardson, a spokeswoman for the U.S. military in Afghanistan told the Times. “The fire from the enemy was indiscriminate and came from multiple directions.”

NYT found that a subsequent U.S. airstrike in the Kunduz city region killed at least 14 civilians, including women and children, as well as four Afghan soldiers. The possible friendly fire incident came about 10 days after a misunderstanding resulted in Afghan service members opening on a patrol of their counterparts and American advisers in southern Afghanistan’s Uruzgan province, triggering a battle and U.S. airstrikes that killed at least five Afghan soldiers and injured nine others.

“We are fighting in a complex environment and this firefight is a prime example of the challenges Afghan and coalition forces face every day,” Sgt. Richardson told NYT on Saturday. “The Taliban were hiding in civilian homes and maneuvered in and out of compounds without any concern for the families living inside.”

“We maintain the right to engage the enemy in self-defense and we take every measure to prevent civilian casualties, even as the Taliban intentionally hide behind women and children,” she added.

On Friday, Voice of America (VOA) reported that two U.S. Army soldiers and an Afghan partner in Kunduz were killed in “joint counter-Taliban operation,” without mentioning anything about an insider attack.

A spokesman for the Taliban reportedly acknowledged that the clash took place in territory held by the terrorist group around Kunduz city, the capital of a volatile province of the same name.

The two recent deaths bring the total number of American military fatalities in the ongoing Afghanistan war to 2,280, according to Pentagon figures. There have also been 20,434 maiming incidents since the conflict began in October 2001. Several U.S. government and independent assessments have deemed the Afghan Taliban the top perpetrator of casualties sustained by the United States and local forces and civilians.

So far this year, four American service members have paid the ultimate sacrifice in Afghanistan. An additional 13 U.S. troops were reportedly killed in combat operations in Afghanistan last year, a slight increase from 11 in 2017.

The vast majority of U.S. military fatalities (74 percent) and injuries (86 percent) took place under former American President Barack Obama’s watch: 1,689 dead and 17,535 wounded.

U.S. President Donald Trump inherited chaotic security conditions from his predecessors — primarily a Taliban emboldened by unprecedented power and influence.

In recent months, the Trump administration has intensified its Taliban peace-seeking efforts to end the conflict, which has come at a cost to American taxpayers of an estimated $3 billion monthly.

Amid the ongoing U.S.-Taliban negotiations to convince the terrorist group to engage in peace talks with the Kabul government, the narco-jihadis have intensified attacks against American troops as well as Afghan forces and civilians.

The terrorist group has managed to make small territorial gains during the peace negotiations, which so far have yielded two draft agreements on the eventual U.S. military withdrawal and assurances by the Taliban that Afghanistan will no longer harbor international terrorist groups like al-Qaeda and the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) — both currently active in the country.

Taliban terrorists still refuse to allow Afghan President Ashraf Ghani’s administration to participate in the talks despite America’s insistence that the negotiations are Kabul led and owned.

In 2015, the Taliban briefly occupied Kunduz city, marking the first provincial capital to fall to the narco-jihadis since American troops removed the terrorist group’s regime from power soon after invading Afghanistan in late 2001. Taliban jihadis overran the city again the following year and have maintained a heavy presence in and around Kunduz city since.

Pentagon officials reportedly offered to pull the U.S. military troops out of Afghanistan within three to five years, acknowledging that it is essential to leave behind a residual counterterrorism force to ensure the Taliban keeps its promises. However, the terrorist group rejected the offer.

Taliban jihadis have long said they will negotiate with Kabul after the complete withdrawal of foreign forces.

According to the latest U.S. government assessment, the Taliban holds more territory and influence now than during any other time since U.S. troops removed its regime from power soon after invading the country in late 2001.


The U.S. sailed warships through the Taiwan Strait this weekend, leading to an angry response from China who warned such actions could further undermine relations between the two countries.

According to Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense, two U.S. vessels sailed through Taiwanese waters off the island’s southwest coast on Sunday, angering officials in Beijing who claim sovereignty over the region.

“China has been closely monitoring from start to end the passage by the U.S. warships through the Taiwan Strait,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a regular news briefing in Beijing on Monday. “China has lodged stern representations with the U.S.”

Meanwhile, Seventh Fleet spokesman Lt. Joe Keiley said that USS Curtis Wilbur and U.S. Coast Guard cutter Bertholf went through “in accordance with international law.”

“The ships’ transit through the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the U.S. commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific,” he said. “The U.S. will continue to fly, sail and operate anywhere international law allows.”

Earlier this month, the U.S. also granted an official request from the Taiwanese government for the purchase of new fighter jets aimed at “countering current enemy threats,” as the Chinese military steps up its aggression against the self-governing island. The two countries separated during the 1949 Civil War, but Beijing now argues that Taiwan should remain under its jurisdiction and demands that they must be reunified, in what is referred to as the ‘One China Policy.’

The U.S., however, has consistently shown steadfast support for Taiwan’s right to self-determination, with last year’s Defense Act stating that it will “strengthen defense and security cooperation with Taiwan to support the development of capable, ready and modern defense forces necessary for Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability.”

The incident comes just days before a scheduled visit to Beijing by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, as the two sides continue negotiations over trade between the world’s two largest economies. Next month, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will also lead a delegation to Washington for follow up talks.

A dark cloud has lifted from over the trade talks between the U.S. and China.

For months, the prospect that President Donald Trump or his close associates could be accused of collusion with Russia has thrown a shadow over the administration’s trade negotiations with China. Sunday’s release of the special counsel’s conclusions, which largely ended the threat of impeachment, give China more incentive to agree to a deal, according to many experts.

“This will be seen as a win for the President. And therefore, on balance, it will be seen as strengthening the U.S. negotiating position,” Kevin Rudd, president of the Asia Society Policy Institute and former Australian prime minister, said on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” Monday morning.

John Rutledge, SAFANAD Chief Investment Officer, agreed with CNBC “Worldwide Exchange” anchor that the end of the Mueller investigation and exoneration of Trump would “open up the possibility for more hardcore, real talks.” Rutledge said the report helps because it makes it more likely Trump will win re-election.

“I think it helps,” Rutledge said. “I think the Mueller report, or actually the Barr report, has now increased the duration of the Trump administration. And so you’ve got more likelihood you are dealing with the same guys in two years. And you’ve also got more likelihood that you’ve got the same tax rates in two years. ”

Some analysts expressed concern that the Mueller report could embolden the Trump administration to push China beyond its tolerance for change in the trade talks.

“China will still have red lines, and a deal is by no means guaranteed, but the fact that an impeachment looks less likely will be meaningful for Beijing’s calculus,” Michael Hirson, Asia director at consulting firm Eurasia Group, said in an email to CNBC. “One question now is whether Trump himself decides that he now has more leverage over Beijing and drives a harder line in negotiations.”

Investors appeared to agree. On Monday, foreigners dumped the most Chinese shares on record, according to Bloomberg.

“Overseas investors net sold 10.8 billion yuan ($1.6 billion) of mainland shares Monday, the biggest single-day sale since the second exchange link with Hong Kong opened in December 2016,” Bloomberg reported.


New Zealand has banned possession of the Christchurch mosque shooter’s manifesto, and ordered citizens to destroy any copies they may possess. The Country’s “Chief Censor” says the manifesto “promotes murder and terrorism.”

According to Business Insider, New Zealand’s Office of Film and Literature Classification “made the decision to ban the document” written by Brenton Tarrant, who killed 50 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, this month, and “told people in possession of the publication to destroy their copies and remove hyperlinks to them online.”

“Anyone found possessing and distributing the manifesto could face up to 10 years and 14 years in prison respectively,” Business Insider reported, adding that New Zealand’s “censorship office” also “made the possession and sharing of the livestream illegal.”

In a statement, New Zealand’s Chief Censor, David Shanks, claimed the manifesto “promotes murder and terrorism.”

“We have dealt with terrorist promotional material before which was deliberately designed to inspire, encourage and instruct other like-minded individuals to carry out further attacks,” Shanks explained. “For example we have found a number of ISIS publications to be objectionable in previous decisions… This publication falls in the same category.”

“There is an important distinction to be made between ‘hate speech,’ which may be rejected by many right-thinking people but which is legal to express, and this type of publication, which is deliberately constructed to inspire further murder and terrorism,” he continued.

New Zealand Free Speech Coalition spokesman Stephen Franks, however, warned against outlawing the manifesto.

“This is a completely improper use of the censorship powers,” Franks declared. “Most New Zealanders will have no interest in reading the rants of an evil person. But there is a major debate going on right now on the causes of extremism. Kiwis should not be wrapped in cotton wool with their news and information censored.”

“New Zealanders need to be able to understand the nature of evil and how it expresses itself,” he expressed. “Our society has surmounted many more terrible threats than this by allowing each citizen to engage, hear, read, and reject evil for themselves. It is completely alien to our history and our strength of a self-ruling citizenry to be told that only those in power may know and tell us what they want us to think an evil person has written.”

“For the same reason we don’t ban Mein Kampf, the manifesto should not be driven underground,” Franks concluded.

Following the shooting, New Zealand announced a ban on semiautomatic rifles and “high-capacity” magazines, while most major internet service providers in the country started to ban websites which hosted the video of the massacre.

One 22-year-old man is already facing up to ten years in prison for allegedly sharing the video of the shooting online, while in England, at least four people have also been arrested over comments they made about the shooting.


North Korean diplomatic staff returned to the joint liaison office in Kaesong on Monday, three days after withdrawing in apparent anger over new U.S. sanctions against Chinese companies that conducted illegal business with North Korea.

The return was seemingly inspired by President Trump ordering the sanctions withdrawn… but the White House said over the weekend that he was referring to different sanctions that have not been imposed yet.

The South Koreans are happy to see Kaesong back in business, but profess a little confusion over the whole affair, as in Chosun Ilbo’s report on Monday:

U.S. President Donald Trump in a surprise announcement Friday withdrew a new round of sanctions against North Korea that had been announced only 24 hours earlier by his own government. “It was announced today by the U.S. Treasury that additional large-scale sanctions would be added to those already existing sanctions on North Korea,” Trump tweeted. “I have today ordered the withdrawal of those additional sanctions!” The move came 17 hours after Pyongyang notified Seoul that it is pulling officials from the new inter-Korean liaison office in the North Korean border town of Kaesong. It is unclear what specific sanctions Trump was canceling. He may have been referring to the Treasury’s announcement of sanctions targeting two Chinese shipping companies that helped North Korea evade sanctions. But U.S. media said he was talking about another round of massive sanctions his administration was preparing to announce this week. Trump’s spur-of-the-moment change of position is no longer surprising but cause confusion because he seemed uncertain what he was talking about. Until then it seemed that Washington was determined to take a harder line on North Korea after a bilateral summit in Hanoi collapsed.

According to Chosun Ilbo, South Korean officials were “flummoxed” on Friday when their North Korean counterparts packed up some papers and departed from the Kaesong office, which is located near a currently inactive joint industrial facility on the border between the two Koreas. They were equally flummoxed when a half-dozen North Koreans showed up for work at the liaison office on Monday, but quickly responded by beefing up the South Korean presence at the facility to a total of 79 staffers, about triple the number that stayed at their posts over the weekend after Pyongyang withdrew its delegation. South Korea’s diplomatic reinforcements arrived at Kaesong in a convoy of 17 vehicles, a passage which had to be approved by the North Korean government.

Seventy-nine South Koreans arriving at Kaesong to engage with five North Korean officials sends quite a message about the South’s eagerness to resume dialogue, even though Chosun Ilbo admitted “no meaningful work” has been done at the facility since it opened last September.

“South Korea’s Unification Ministry earlier would not explain exactly what the 64 officials would be doing at the office without their North Korean counterparts, but a spokesman said Seoul is seeking to try to ‘normalize’ operations at the office,” Reuters wrote.

Or, as South Korea’s deputy chief of the liaison office Kim Chang-su put it, much more poetically: “Although the North side has pulled out of the liaison office, the embers remain, and in order to guard the embers we are going to work today as usual.”

Stars and Stripes reported the North Korean delegation “held a meeting with their South Korean counterparts” on Monday, but it was “unclear whether operations were being fully restored.”

North Korean staffers reportedly told South Korean officials, “We came to do our shift as usual today.” They declined to elaborate on precisely why most of the North Korean delegation left on Friday.

The North Korean staffers added that Pyongyang wishes the joint liaison office to “implement projects in accordance with the inter-Korean joint declarations” made over the past year. North Korea’s state-run media carried exactly the opposite message on Monday morning, railing against the South Koreans for “shamefully” daring to pursue “inter-Korean cooperation projects” while sanctions remained in place against North Korea.

South Korean media reported on Monday that the United Nations granted a six-month waiver from sanctions against agencies providing humanitarian assistance to North Korea, including food and medical services.


Chinese President Xi Jinping ignored overtures by the Vatican, meeting with state leaders but avoiding Pope Francis during his visit to Rome this week.

Mr. Xi met with Italian President Sergio Mattarella, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and even made time to visit the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier but requested no meeting with the pope, despite several hints by the Vatican that the doors were open to a meeting. It is unusual for visiting heads of state not to see the pope when visiting Rome.

On Saturday, Italy signed up to China’s Belt and Road Initiative, a commercial alliance that has alarmed Italy’s neighbors and allies.

For its part, Italy has insisted that the deal is a win-win situation that will shore up infrastructure at ports such as Genoa and Trieste and inject new life into its ailing economy.

“We remain an ally of the U.S. and NATO, but when it’s a question of commercial relations, [signing accords] is what interests me,” said Luigi Di Maio, a deputy prime minister and leader of Italy’s Five Star Movement, following the signing ceremony.

A week ago Reuters reported that “senior Vatican sources” said that the pope had made known to the Chinese president his willingness to meet with him.

In a follow-up, the Vatican’s secretary of state Cardinal Pietro Parolin said China had nothing to fear from the Catholic Church.

In the preface to a new book on China published this past week, Cardinal Parolin wrote that the Vatican harbors “no distrust or hostility toward any country” and that the Church adopts “a stance of respect, esteem, and trust toward the Chinese people and their legitimate state authorities.”

In 2017, Pope Francis said he would love to visit China “as soon as they invite me,” while working to reestablish diplomatic relations that were severed in 1951.

“China always has this aura of mystery about it that is fascinating,” Francis said. “In China the churches are full. You can practice your faith in China.”

Earlier, the pope had said the West should not fear China’s growth as an emerging power on the world stage. “Fear is not a good counselor,” Francis said in 2016, while adding that China’s growth should come as no surprise to anyone.

It is obvious, he said, “that so much culture and so much wisdom, and in addition, so much technical knowledge – we have only to think of age-old medicinal techniques – cannot remain enclosed within a country; they tend to expand, to spread, to communicate.”

The Vatican signed a provisional agreement with China last September, which involved yielding an unspecified role to the Communist party in the naming of Catholic bishops in the country, a deal that some high-ranking Church officials have labeled a “betrayal” of Chinese Catholics. Ever since then, the Chinese Communist party has continued its ongoing crackdown on religious expression that does not conform to China’s socialist ideals.

The former bishop of Hong Kong, Cardinal Joseph Zen has been a vocal critic of what he sees as the Vatican’s over-eagerness to reestablish relations with China at any cost, saying that Pope Francis “is really naïve” and “doesn’t know the Chinese communists.”

At the moment, the Vatican maintains diplomatic relations with Taiwan, but would have to sever them in order to establish diplomatic relations with mainland China.

A closely-watched measure of inflation unexpectedly turned negative in January, providing the latest evidence that the Federal Reserve’s 2018 rate hikes went too far.

The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, the price index for personal-consumption expenditures, fell 0.1 percent in January from December. Economists had expected prices to remain flat.

Compared with the prior year, the index is up just 1.4 percent, the Commerce Department said Friday.

Lower energy prices played a role in holding down inflation. The so-called core PCE price index, which strips out volatile food and energy components, rose 0.1 percent from December. That was also below expectations for a 0.2 percent rise. Compared with a year ago, core PCE was up 1.8 percent.

Both the headline number and the core figure are below the Federal Reserve’s target of 2 percent inflation. The Fed has undershot its inflation target on an annual basis ever since the Great Recession, with a brief exception in 2012.

In January, the Fed changed its monetary policy from gradual rate hikes to “patience,” meaning the Fed would hold off on further hikes until more evidence came in about the strength of the economy and inflation. Projections of Fed policymakers released after the Fed’s meeting last week showed most of the central bankers do not foresee moving the Fed’s target rate from a range of 2.25 percent and 2.5 percent this year.

The market in fed funds futures now appears to be pricing in at least one rate cut by the end of the year and gives a 25 percent chance of a second rate cut. Last week, the yield curve inverted, a sign that traders think interest rates will decline in the future. An inverted yield curve is considered a harbinger of recessions, particularly if the curve stays inverted for several months.

Stephen Moore, the economic pundit Trump is expected to appoint to a vacant seat on the Federal Reserve’s board, has said he thinks the Fed should reverse its last two rate hikes. Moore was severely critical of those hikes and even called for Fed chair Powell to resign after December’s rate raise, a stance Moore now says he regrets.

Fed Vice Chair Randall Quarles on Friday said he believes the economy will be strong enough to support a rate hike, seeming to push back against market expectations that the next move in rates will be downward.


President Donald Trump took his fight with GM and an auto union to a rally stage in Michigan Thursday night, declaring, “get the damn plants open. Everyone else is coming in.”

“General Motors did just announce a $300 million dollar investment at its Orion assembly plant here in Michigan, right now,” said the president. “But I’m also fighting with General Motors and the [United Automobile Workers] to take swift action on the GM plants at Hamtramck and Warren, Michigan, and Lordstown, Ohio. Get the damn plants open. Everyone else is coming in. Get ‘em open now!”

The Lordstown plant closure could cost an estimated 8,000 American jobs in that town. GM let 1,500 American workers at the Lordstown plant go in 2018. Production in Mexico and China either maintained pace or increased production.

“So with companies like Chrysler and Ford and Toyota and Volkswagen all investing heavily in America and heavily in the state of Michigan, we think General Motors will soon be doing the same,” said Trump. “I really do believe it.”

“They went, before my time, they went to China, they spent a lot of money building stuff. They went to Mexico, they spent a lot of money building stuff,” said President Trump. “That’s not helping us.”

A New Jersey state union official said she now regrets her tweet Wednesday stating she hopes U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos “dies a horrible, horrible death.”

“I hope she dies a horrible horrible death,” says @CWA_NJ state director @HettyRosenstein after Betsy DeVos cut federal funding for the Special Olympics. https://t.co/8FnQk7HdEf — David Wildstein (@wildstein) March 27, 2019

Hetty Rosenstein, a Communications Workers of America state director, said she tweeted her hopes for DeVos’s “horrible, horrible death” after she heard the Trump administration was seeking to make cuts to the Special Olympics program.

“Late at night on Tuesday I learned that Betsy De Vos was cutting 100% of federal funding for the Special Olympics,” Rosenstein said, according to the New Jersey Globe. “I don’t know the last time I heard such horrible news or felt such despair. I had just posted that I couldn’t sleep. And so I said something out of that despair that I regret.”

"I said something out of that despair that I regret. I should not have said it," says @HettyRosenstein, apologizing for a tweet about @BetsyDeVosED. https://t.co/Nf4DA8uFoI — David Wildstein (@wildstein) March 28, 2019

Cuts to the Special Olympics – a private organization – however, have been recommended by both the Trump and Bush administrations in the past, but have been ignored by Congress. In fact, Congress has even increased funding to the program for children with disabilities.

Cutting federal funding to the special olympics isn't a new idea: the Trump admin proposed it last year, and Bush in his last year in office. (Both requests were ignored by Congress.) This is the first year it's really blown up https://t.co/VWOxvCuUBR — Michelle Hackman (@MHackman) March 27, 2019

Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, a Republican who chairs the Senate appropriations subcommittee that oversees education spending, had already said Special Olympics funding would not be cut.

“Our Department of Education appropriations bill will not cut funding for the program,” Blunt said.

Nevertheless, Democrats this week are portraying the Trump administration as dismissive of children with disabilities because of the proposed budget cuts to the Special Olympics organization.

Politico reported comments about DeVos’s defense of the administration’s budget proposal during a congressional hearing “went viral.”

On Tuesday, Democrats pounced on the proposed cut in funding. Rep. Barbara Lee of California referred to the plan as “appalling.”

“I still can’t understand why you would go after disabled children in your budget,” she said.

“The department’s fiscal 2020 proposal would eliminate federal money for Special Olympics Education programs,” Politico noted. “The department’s last two budget proposals would also have eliminated federal funding, but nothing would be cut unless Congress agreed to do so, and Congress has rejected administration plans. In fact, Congress has increased the funding.”

DeVos released a statement Wednesday targeting the spread of the inaccuracies over the proposed budget cuts to Special Olympics.

“It is unacceptable, shameful and counterproductive that the media and some members of Congress have spun up falsehoods and fully misrepresented the facts,” the secretary said, adding that President Donald Trump’s budget “supports our nation’s 7 million students with disabilities through a $13.2 billion request for IDEA funding, the same funding level appropriated by Congress.”

“All of that money goes directly to states to ensure students with disabilities have the resources and supports they need,” DeVos continued. “The budget also requests an additional $225.6 million for competitively awarded grants to support teacher preparation, research and technical assistance to support students with disabilities.”

“I should not have said it,” Rosenstein said about her tweet hoping for DeVos’s death. “I am a leader and I should have mustered something to help to inspire others to continue to fight for justice and to fight the power and privilege and immorality of the politics of DeVos.”

In 2018 DeVos announced she would donate part of her salary to the Special Olympics.

“The Special Olympics is not a federal program,” the secretary said in her statement Wednesday. “It’s a private organization. I love its work, and I have personally supported its mission. Because of its important work, it is able to raise more than $100 million every year.”


If a cliche dies in the forest and no one reports it, has it really died?

Over the last two years there have been an uncountable number of reports that the Trump administration’s trade policies would hurt American workers. One widely reported study even claimed that for every one job created by the tariffs on steel and aluminum tariffs, five jobs would be lost. A study commissioned by Koch Industries claimed last year that tariffs would throw 2.75 million American out of work.

Here’s a pretty typical story from MarketWatch:

Back when economists such as Paul Krugman and Mark Zandi feared that Donald Trump’s election would make markets sell-off en route to a recession, they typically argued that tax cuts would goose the economy early in Trump’s term, but protectionist trade policies would spoil the party in the end. Now we may get to see if they were right… “It’s the worst possible nightmare for the economy,” said Economic Outlook Group chief economist Bernard Baumohl, with perhaps a touch of hyperbole. More expensive steel in the U.S raises costs for companies making cars, homes, office buildings and more — and could push inflation up above 3% by 2019 or 2020, he argues. “More workers in the U.S. make products that are made from steel, than make steel itself.”

That was from March of 2018.

We’re now just over the one year mark since the Trump administration began raising tariffs, first on metals and later on China. And we have our answer to Market Watch’s: there are no signs that tariffs are hurting U.S. workers either by raising unemployment, triggering layoffs, or raising prices.

Inflation undershot the Federal Reserve’s target last year. In the most recent report, the consumer price index gained 2.1 percent year-over-year. There’s no evidence of tariffs raising consumer prices generally. And inflation expectations recently hit a 50-year low.

The best and most timely data we have on layoffs in the U.S. are the weekly jobless claims. And these have shown no signs of tariff related layoffs. In fact, they have been at or near historic lows.

This week was no different. The number of Americans filing applications fell by 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 211,000 in the week ended March 23, according to the Labor Department. Economists surveyed by Econoday expected 225,000 new claims last week.

Not only that, prior claims data was revised down. The prior week’s claims, initially reported at 221,000, came in at 216,000.

While the weekly jobless claims data is dutifully reported by the financial media, they are otherwise ignored. As a result, outlets such as the New York Times still print headlines claiming “Trump Tariffs Threaten U.S. Jobs.”

It’s another journalist claims data can be volatile from week to week. But the four-week moving average of claims also declined this week. And it has been remarkably steady, even while the government partially shut down for 35-days. The volatility of jobless claims has virtually vanished because claims have been so consistently low.

Unfortunately, I doubt we’ve seen the last article claiming tariffs are costing U.S. jobs. Apparently one of the rules of financial journalism in the Trump era is to never let the facts stand in the way of the narrative.


President Donald Trump slammed leaders in Mexico and Central America on Thursday morning for allowing the wave of economic migrants to reach U.S. borders, just a few hours after United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen announced a “historic” deal with Central American countries.

Trump’s tweet said he might “close the Southern Border” to penalize Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador which rely heavily on trade with the United States. But any border closure would generate a roar of objections from business leaders and GOP legislators in Congress.

Mexico is doing NOTHING to help stop the flow of illegal immigrants to our Country. They are all talk and no action. Likewise, Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador have taken our money for years, and do Nothing. The Dems don’t care, such BAD laws. May close the Southern Border! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 28, 2019

Trump’s statement that Central American leaders “do Nothing” came less than a day after Nielsen declared a “historic” agreement with leaders in Central America:

I'm pleased to announce the U.S. & our Northern Triangle allies have reached a HISTORIC agreement to confront the root causes of the crisis on our border. Working with Central American govts to increase security & prosperity in the region has been one of my greatest priorities. pic.twitter.com/QQMpZVI9yp — Sec. Kirstjen Nielsen (@SecNielsen) March 27, 2019

Nielsen did not explain the “historic” deal in her tweet, which came out as border officials said the cross-border inflow hit 4,100 migrants on Tuesday and is on track to hit almost 1 million during 2019. The inflow is rising because Congress and the courts have cut many legal loopholes in border laws.

Trump said Mexican officials are “doing NOTHING to help stop the flow of illegal immigrants to our Country. They are all talk and no action.”

The charge comes after DHS officials revealed the existence of low-cost bus routes through Mexico for Central Americans seeking to reach the U.S. border. The Central Americans migrants take the bus routes through Mexico, then walk across the U.S. borderline, cross the fence or wall, ask for asylum, and are then released to take jobs and school seats in the United States.

However, the U.S. Congress is doing nothing to close the border loopholes and is actually aiding the migrant inflow. In February, for example, Congress agreed to spend more than $400 million to aid the migrants. It also established rules to protect the illegal immigrants in the United States who pay the cartels to smuggle their children through Mexico to U.S. border agencies.

The rising inflow of migrants will force down wages for blue-collar Americans, weaken schools used by blue-collar Americans, and drain government aid used by blue-collar Americans in an economy that already includes at least 11 million illegal migrants. The resident illegals — as well as 34 million legal immigrants — shift U.S. income towards employers, investors, and real-estate owners and also grab much attention and sympathy from elite Americans in Congress, the courts, and the media.

Nielsen also tweeted out a video of her speech to a Wednesday meeting of regional leaders:

.@DHSgov @SecNielsen’s closing statement at the V Northern Triangle security ministers meeting in #Honduras. https://t.co/DOsmYHk7Yh — US Embassy Honduras (@usembassyhn) March 27, 2019

She said:

Our message to criminals is this ‘You will be caught and you will be prosecuted.’ While this agreement between our nations is the first of its kind, and it is not a silver bullet to ending our shared migration crisis, the United States stands with its friends in the Northern Triangle and have always helped spur economic prosperity throughout out the region. However, more must be done to combat this crisis and the United States must see measurable improvements in the short term.

Each year, roughly four million young Americans join the workforce after high school or university. The federal government then imports roughly 1.1 million legal immigrants, refreshes a resident population of roughly 1.5 million white-collar guest workers and roughly 500,000 blue-collar visa workers, and it also tolerates about eight million illegal workers.

In 2019, because of catch-and-release rules mandated by Congress and the courts, the federal government also will likely release at least 350,000 Central American laborers into the U.S. job market, even as at least 500,000 more migrants sneak past U.S. border defenses or overstay their visas.

Overall, in 2019, the U.S. government will allow at least two million new foreign workers into the United States to compete for the starter jobs sought by the latest wave of four million U.S. graduates. The new migrants also undermine the 24 million other Americans and the roughly three million legal immigrants who have joined the workforce since 2014.

This federal policy of using legal and illegal migration to boost economic growth for investors shifts enormous wealth from young employees towards older investors by flooding the market with cheap white-collar graduates and blue-collar foreign labor.

This cheap labor economic policy forces Americans to compete even for low wage jobs, it widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids’ schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines millions of marginalized Americans, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.


Democrats this week are portraying the Trump administration as dismissive of children with disabilities because of proposed budget cuts to the Special Olympics organization.

U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos released a statement Wednesday in defense of cuts to the Special Olympics – a private organization – that have been recommended in the past, but ignored by Congress anyway.

The Wall Street Journal‘s Michelle Hackman tweeted:

Cutting federal funding to the special olympics isn't a new idea: the Trump admin proposed it last year, and Bush in his last year in office. (Both requests were ignored by Congress.) This is the first year it's really blown up https://t.co/VWOxvCuUBR — Michelle Hackman (@MHackman) March 27, 2019

While Democrats and their allies condemn abortion restrictions that ban the procedure simply because an unborn baby is diagnosed with a disability, they let loose a social media firestorm on the Trump administration for suggesting $17.6 million in federal funding cuts to the Special Olympics program.

Democrat politicians are portrayed in media as defending disabled children, “vowing” the cuts will not happen – when the fact is, they have never happened. In fact, Congress has provided even more funding to the Special Olympics.

Politico reported DeVos’ defense of the administration’s budget proposal during a congressional hearing “went viral”:

On Tuesday, Democrats pounced on the proposed cut during the hearing, with Rep. Barbara Lee of California calling the plan “appalling.” “I still can’t understand why you would go after disabled children in your budget,” Lee said.

“Some tweets claimed DeVos had already cut the funding,” the report continued:

Betsy DeVos just confirmed the Department of Education cut all funding for the Special Olympics — Roger Sollenberger (@SollenbergerRC) March 26, 2019

As the report also stated, however:

The department’s fiscal 2020 proposal would eliminate federal money for Special Olympics Education programs. The department’s last two budget proposals would also have eliminated federal funding, but nothing would be cut unless Congress agreed to do so, and Congress has rejected administration plans. In fact, Congress has increased the funding.

“It is unacceptable, shameful and counterproductive that the media and some members of Congress have spun up falsehoods and fully misrepresented the facts,” said DeVos in her statement Wednesday, adding that President Donald Trump’s budget “supports our nation’s 7 million students with disabilities through a $13.2 billion request for IDEA funding, the same funding level appropriated by Congress.”

“All of that money goes directly to states to ensure students with disabilities have the resources and supports they need,” the secretary continued. “The budget also requests an additional $225.6 million for competitively awarded grants to support teacher preparation, research and technical assistance to support students with disabilities.”

Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, a Republican who chairs the Senate appropriations subcommittee that oversees education spending, has already said Special Olympics funding would not be cut.

Folks, the cuts are not happening! Roy Blunt, the senator in charge of Education Department funding: "Our Department of Education appropriations bill will not cut funding for the program." https://t.co/dAqqqPJ33x — Michelle Hackman (@MHackman) March 27, 2019

“I’m a longtime supporter of Special Olympics and proud that Missouri is home to the largest Special Olympics training facility in the world,” Blunt said in a statement. “I was just at the World Games and saw, as I have many times before, what a huge impact the organization has on athletes, their families, and their communities. Our Department of Education appropriations bill will not cut funding for the program.”

“The Special Olympics is not a federal program,” DeVos stressed. “It’s a private organization. I love its work, and I have personally supported its mission. Because of its important work, it is able to raise more than $100 million every year.”

In 2018 DeVos announced she would donate part of her salary to the Special Olympics.


The U.S. economy grew at a modest pace in the fourth quarter, slower than previously reported.

Gross domestic product, a broad measure of the goods and services produced in the U.S., expanded at a 2.2 percent annual rate in October through December, the government said Thursday. That was less than the 2.6 percent growth reported in the prior estimate published in February.

The downward revision was in line with expectations. In the third quarter, real GDP increased 3.4 percent.

The estimate was pushed lower by downward revisions of estimates of spending by consumers, state and local government,s and businesses. In a welcome development for the Trump administration, foreign trade was revised to show a smaller drag from net imports

The economy grew at 3.0 percent last year, when measured by comparing its output in the fourth quarter of 2018 versus the fourth quarter of 2017. The Federal Reserve and most business economists prefer to use that measure. The Bureau of Economic Analysis uses a different measure, which looks at total output for 2018 compared to total output for 2017. By this measure, the economy grew 2.9 percent in 2018.


The number of migrants daily crossing the U.S. border hit a decade-long record of 4,100 on Tuesday, says border commissioner Kevin McAleenan.

According to the Washington Post:

McAleenan said the agency detained more than 4,100 migrants Tuesday, the highest one-day total at the border in more than a decade, and agency projections have border apprehensions on pace to exceed 100,000 this month — an increase of more than 30 percent. By comparison, at the height of the last border crisis, in May 2014, agents apprehended more than 68,800 migrants that month.

The inflow includes a record number of youths and children who are being delivered to the border by coyotes, often under a contract with the foreign parents who are already living and working illegally in the underground economy. The Post reported:

[Customs and Border Protection] officials say they are particularly alarmed by the soaring number of unaccompanied juveniles in crowded detention cells because Health and Human Services can’t place them in shelters fast enough. CBP officials said they have 1,350 underage migrants in holding cells without a parent — and 20 percent are 12 years old or younger.

Trump's deputies are arresting more of the US-based illegals/parents who hire cartels to smuggle their children up to US cities. The arrests shrink the US-exit of the 'UAC' pipeline even as more UACs to arrive. Obvs, biz & Democrats oppose the arrests. https://t.co/6SxqAEQ7NJ — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) December 11, 2018

But the inflow of foreign children and youths into Americans’ blue-collar schools and jobs is aided by statements from McAleenan and other agency officials who say the young migrants cannot be repatriated until Congress changes a 2008 law. But that law targeted “severe trafficking,” such as the involuntary movement of prostitutes under the control of international criminal gangs.

The cross-border flow of children and youths — dubbed “UACs” — is also being protected by a clause in the 2019 budget which makes it difficult for enforcement officials to detect and deport the foreign parents who pay coyotes to deliver their children to the U.S. border agents who then relay the young migrants to temporary shelters run by the Department of Health and Human Services. The parents then pick up their children at the shelters by offering to “sponsor” them until a later court hearing. The UAC-smuggling clause was demanded by Democratic negotiators and approved in February by the GOP negotiators, who had earlier agreed to exclude DHS experts from the closed-door talks.

The 2019 DHS spending bill provides $1.4 billion for the border wall – and also encourages migrants by promising aid, busses & legal advice/shields, plus favorable future media coverage & Dem cheerleading. Overall, GOP gains on $ and Dems gain on policies https://t.co/rxFzl8Fas0 — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) February 14, 2019

In a Wednesday speech at the border, McAleenan declared:

Two weeks ago, I briefed the media and testified in Congress that our immigration system was at the breaking point. That breaking point has arrived this week at our border … We are on pace for over 100,000 apprehensions and encounters with migrants in March, with 90 percent of those — 90,000 people — [being unable] to be repatriated expeditiously and instead are almost guaranteed to be released and to remain in the U.S. indefinitely, regardless of the merits of their immigration or asylum claim.

The March inflow will include roughly 15,000 parents and 40,000 children in “family units” who will ask for asylum — and then will be released — plus roughly 35,000 single adults who will try to evade border officers, he said.

McAleenan pinned the blame on Congress and the judges who have jointly cut legal holes in the border fences by allowing migrants to stream into U.S. cities, jobs, and schools if they merely ask for asylum:

The increase in family units is a direct response to the vulnerabilities in our legal frameworks where migrants and smugglers know that they will be released and be allowed to stay in the U.S. indefinitely pending immigration proceedings that could be many years out. This is due to court orders that undermine the integrity of our immigration system. There is no questioning [about] why this is happening.

“This economic migration … is overwhelming [the smaller] legitimate asylum population,” that is likely to win court cases for asylum, he said.

Border security is at "breaking point" says border commissioner, as data suggests 1M by Oct.

The Sheriff’s Department in California’s Orange County is ending its contract with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to hold illegal migrants in jail.

The Orange County decision comes amid a rapid rise in demand for mental health services, including counseling and hospital care for Californian criminals, according to a press statement.

The change means that illegal migrants caught by DHS will be transferred to other prison space that is being rented to DHS’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) by states and local jurisdictions around the nation.

But the decision comes as progressives are pressuring jurisdictions to give up the valuable contracts and also pressuring banks to stop providing loans to companies who wish to build jails for DHS contracts.

The campaign is one of many efforts by progressives to constrict enforcement of immigration law despite the popular support for enforcement of the nation’s immigration laws.

The sheriff’s department says the decision was made to free up space for the mental health treatment of its California prisoners.

KABC reported:

Over the last five years, the county has seen a 40-percent spike in mental health cases. Some of the services will include counseling, medication management and psychiatric inpatient care. The county will also be expanding the number of beds available. Once the contract is formally terminated, ICE has 120 days to relocate its detainees who are currently in the custody of the sheriff’s department.

Nationwide, DHS keeps around 50,000 in detention while it processes them for court hearings or deportations.


Americans’ border security is collapsing this week, says Kevin McAleenan, the commissioner of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency.

“Two weeks ago, I briefed the media and testified in Congress that our immigration system was at the breaking point,” McAleenan said at press conference in El Paso, Texas.

“That breaking point has arrived this week at our border,” he said, adding:

We are on pace for over 100,000 apprehensions and encounters with migrants in March, with 90 percent of those — 90,000 people — [being unable] to be repatriated expeditiously and instead are almost guaranteed to be released and to remain in the U.S. indefinitely, regardless of the merits of their immigration or asylum claim.

The March inflow will include roughly 15,000 parents and 40,000 children in “family units” who will ask for asylum — and then will be released — plus roughly 35,000 single adults who will try to evade border officers, he said.

McAleenan pinned the blame on Congress and the judges who have jointly cut legal holes in the border fences by allowing migrants to stream into U.S. cities if they merely ask for asylum:

The increase in family units is a direct response to the vulnerabilities in our legal frameworks where migrants and smugglers know that they will be released and be allowed to stay in the U.S. indefinitely pending immigration proceedings that could be many years out. This is due to court orders that undermine the integrity of our immigration system. There is no questioning [about] why this is happening.

“This economic migration … is overwhelming [the smaller] legitimate asylum population,” that is likely to win court cases for asylum, he said.

But McAleenan’s comments are just blame-shifting, said Jessica Vaughan, policy director at the Center for Immigration Studies.

Congress has shown it is unwilling to block the flow of migrants, yet officials at the Department of Homeland Security are doing little to shame Congress or to work around it, she said. Officials should be pressuring judges to repair the damage caused by pro-migration announcements, pressuring regulators to fast-track new regulations, rebuking business groups, rejecting media pressure, and forcing agency lawyers to discard pro-migration rules set by former President Barack Obama, she said.

McAleenan’s “CBP keeps shooting down various [internal] proposals that would untie the hands of government [officials] and are internally vetoing a lot of ideas that might work,” partly because top DHS officials are deferring to the pro-migration preferences of business groups, she said.

For example, McAleenan said the 2008 TVPRA law bars DHS from repatriating youths from Central America. But that law was passed to protect the victims of “severe trafficking,” such as prostitutes under the control of gangs. However, McAleenan’s agency has former President Barack Obama’s policy of defining “severe trafficking” to include the “UAC” youths who are being safely escorted to U.S. border agencies by coyotes working under contracts with the youths’ illegal-immigrant parents.

Agency officials “seem more concerned about their professional image than they are about implementing the tough border security that is needed to protect the country and American communities,” she said.

“They have to fight back, they can’t just throw a white flag and say, ‘Congress must fix this,'” she said.

McAleenan, for example, did not try to criticize legislators’ or judges’ unwillingness to guard the nation’s borders, even though a televised tide of Central Americans are rushing themselves and their children through the border to take low-wage jobs, school spaces, and government aid from blue-collar Americans.

He did not point out that elite Americans, employers, real estate owners, and government workers all gain as the flood of low-wage workers and government-dependent migrants gratefully work at low wages, bid up rental costs, and take free schooling and other aid from government agencies.

Immigration lawyers and judges also gain from their ability to get paid while awarding American green cards to the grateful migrants.

McAleenan said large groups of migrants are helping the Mexican cartels smuggle drugs and more cheap labor into U.S communities. “They are bringing drugs, they are being adults who are trying to evade capture behind those families as we are bogged down [processing the] large groups.”

But McAleenan did not note that drugs killed roughly 70,000 Americans in 2017, amid elite efforts to hide the problem during Obama’s terms. Wages were also flat during Obama’s term, as he helped elite companies and investors by encouraging the mass migration of cheap workers.

The border inflow dropped sharply in 2017 because of President Donald Trump’s focus on border security. As a result, wages rose by more than three percent during 2018, as Trump’s “Hire American” policy reduced the inflow of illegal and legal cheap labor.

Goldman Sachs says Trump's tight labor-market policy (AKA 'Hire American') gave 4% raise to blue-collar/middle-class in 2018. But upper-income graduate salaries lagged – maybe b/c of 1.5 million visa-worker graduates who work for spaghettiOs & green cards https://t.co/g6jtv9BS81 — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) March 14, 2019

Trump’s wage-boosting policy is strongly opposed by business groups, nearly all Democrats, by many GOP legislators, and is largely ignored by establishment media outlets who are eager to focus on the welfare of the migrants. Throughout 2018, these opponents also blocked Trump’s border security reforms and minimized funding for Trump’s proposed border wall.

McAleenan described some of the steps which his agency is taking to manage the rising inflow.

“In the absence of immediate correctional action which we are asking and calling for again for today … we’re going to be taking every action in our power to try to manage this crisis,” McAleenan said.

The crisis is forcing the agency to divert up to 40 percent of officers to provide aid and healthcare to migrants who cross the border, McAleenan said. “Our security posture at the border is negatively impacted,” he added.

The agency has also moved 750 officers from the formal “ports of entry,” even as Democrats say officers should focus on the ports to prevent the smuggling of drugs in autos and cargo vehicles. The personnel shift ensures “there will be a slowdown in the processing of trade … this is required to help us manage this operational crisis,” he said.

But, McAleenan warned, “the only way to fundamentally address these flows is for Congress to act.”

“That’s what he and [DHS Secretary Kirstjen] Nielsen keep saying … as if they are absolved from doing anything [more] with their own authority,” said Vaughan, adding:

The leadership of the House does not want to do anything and I’ve not convinced the leadership of the Senate wants to do anything. Secondly, what they want to do [is worse] … House Democrats want to allow people to come in and ask for asylum. This [border collapse] is all fine with them, so why would they feel any urgency to act? The only way Democrats would help is if they think they can get something they want, which is a massive amnesty and more restrictions on enforcement and more green cards.

That option was hinted by Leon Fresco, an immigration attorney who helped write the disastrous 2013 “Gang of Eight” amnesty for Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer:

This is serious — it is time for the serious people in Congress to get together to do something. Don't worry about the White House for now. Just come up with a bill with strong bipartisan support that solves as many problems as we can solve.https://t.co/zBSu4sHdvE — Leon Fresco (@FrescoLeon) March 27, 2019

Fresco’s reference to “as many problems as we can solve” hints at the Congress’s desire to help business allies by importing more white-collar and blue-collar labor, Vaughan said.

For example, Fresco and business groups are already pushing for legislation — H.R. 1044 and S. 386 — that would offer roughly 100,000 green cards per year to low-wage Indian graduates if they take U.S. jobs from hundreds of thousands of middle class Americans.

Weird but true: GOP and Dems in Congress are offering fast-track green cards to encourage 300,000+ vr. low wage Indian workers to take jobs from middle class American voters & graduates. FWIW I don't think the pols & staffers recognize what they are doing https://t.co/4TIUFzhC9b — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) March 1, 2019

Border curbs “are only problems for the cheap labor crowd,” said Vaughan. “To them, the problems are not enough cheap labor,” she said. “For Americans, the problem is not enough enforcement, security, and jobs for Americans,” she said.

But, she added, “there should be a real concern that the administration is willing to give up on all of that in exchange for the ability to enforce the border, which would be a terrible deal.”


Foreign interference helped swing votes to Democrats in the midterm elections, say economists who studied the impact of retaliatory tariffs on the United States.

Thomas Fetzer and Carlo Schwarz of the University of Warwick looked at the voting patterns in places that were targeted by retaliatory tariffs imposed by Canada, China, Mexico, and the European Union. They found that Republican candidates in counties most exposed to retaliation fared worse by between 1.4 to 2.7 percentage points.

The retaliatory tariffs particularly hurt President Donald Trump’s approval ratings among Democrats, the economists found. Among Republicans, however, the negative effect was much smaller and not statistically significant.

This was not accidental. The study finds that the retaliatory tariffs were “strongly and distinctly targeted towards areas that supported Trump in the 2016 election.” More startlingly, the tariffs were calibrated not just to sting Trump supporting areas but were specifically aimed at areas that swung to Trump in the 2016 presidential election.

The economists go so far as to describe a secret algorithm used to target swing Trump counties:

It appears that the targeting is sharp and distinctly designed to hit areas that saw disproportionate changes in support for Donald Trump as Republican candidate in the Presidential elections 2016, but not to areas that swung to Republican candidates in the House or Senate elections that also took place in 2016. This suggests a high degree of calibration of the retaliation response, which, in the case of the European Union is designed using a secret algorithm, which has been described as the ‘weapon of war’ in this dispute.

Fetzer and Schwartz explained that “our findings suggest that, similar to sanctions, retaliatory tariffs can be used to affect political outcomes.”

By their estimate, at least $15 billion of U.S. exports were affected by the retaliation measures between July and December 2018.

The economists are not Trump supporters. In their paper, they take a critical tone when discussing the Trump administration’s tariffs and characterize the retaliation as an inevitable response to U.S. provocation.

“Our results indicate that nativist policies themselves, by triggering retaliation of trading partners, may itself have non-negligible adverse economic effects and may trigger a political backlash, by virtue of the retaliation being highly targeted,” they write.

To Fetzer and Schwartz, the lesson is that “retaliatory measures can harm the electoral outcomes of politicians. Therefore, policymakers would need to consider the impact of likely retaliatory measures before making a decision on trade policy.”

That, however, assumes that politicians should make policy not according to what is in the national interest but in their own political interest.


Vice President Mike Pence assured American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) attendees Monday in the wake of the Mueller report that the Trump administration will remain focused on issues important to America.

“After two years of investigation and reckless accusations by many Democrats and members of the media, the Special Counsel confirmed what President Trump said along: There was no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election,” Mike Pence told the AIPAC crowd. “And the Attorney General confirmed there was no obstruction of justice,” he said to applause from the crowd.

“Make no mistake about it, my fellow Americans: This was total vindication of the President of the United States and our campaign, and it should be welcomed by every American,” said the vice president.

He assured that the Trump administration would keep its focus on a more prosperous America and a safer world:

Even if some Democrats want to spend more time on discredited allegations, the American people can be confident the president and I are going to continue to focus where we always have — on the issues that are most important to our country: on a stronger and more prosperous America and on a safer world. And that’s exactly what we’ve done since the first day of this administration.

The crowd again applauded.

Pence spoke of massive investment in America’s military, the end of the Islamic State (ISIS) caliphate, an American economic resurgence following massive tax and regulatory cuts, and a deep commitment to the alliance between America and Israel.

U.S. geopolitical power needs a steady supply of fresh immigrants to serve as soldiers and workers, according to a pro-migration op-ed in Bloomberg news.

“A large working-age population serves as a source of military manpower,” says the op-ed by Hal Brands, the Henry Kissinger Distinguished Professor at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies. He continues:

… a relatively young, growing and well-educated population is a wellspring of the economic productivity that underlies other forms of international influence … countries with healthy demographic profiles can create wealth more easily than their competitors [and] can also can direct a larger share of that wealth to geopolitical projects as opposed to pensions and health care.

Brands acknowledges — but denounces — the reality that immigration is largely unpopular among the voters who suffer from the resulting diversity, elite disengagement, job theft, and wage loss. That turmoil helped outsider Donald Trump win the White House in 2016. Brands dismisses the public’s measured response as “draconian … xenophobia … race-based politics,” and says:

… if current trends are any indication, the U.S. could easily squander its demographic advantages [over China and Russia] by enacting draconian immigration restrictions or simply destroying its image as a country that welcomes ambitious newcomers. Conversely, if the proportion of immigrants continues to rise while the white population shrinks, xenophobia and race-based politics could become more common and more toxic.

After making these dire predictions, Brands declines to offer the public anything in exchange for the diversity, political divisions, taxpayer costs, and wage losses caused by the government policy of “refreshing the population”:

If the U.S. is to keep its demographic edge, it will have to find ways of reconciling two competing imperatives: refreshing the population through immigration while preserving social and political stability.

Brands dismisses the public’s expectation that their government serves citizens and their children, and he instead echoes the 1960s demand that Americans must give up their homeland to become a “nation of immigrants” to help beat Russian communism.

In an October 2018 article for Time magazine, Democratic Rep. Joe Kennedy explained the government-boosting origin of the “Nation of Immigrants” claim:

Few felt it as deeply as President John F. Kennedy. In his 1964 book A Nation of Immigrants, recently re-released, my great-uncle outlines the compelling case for immigration, in economic, moral, and global terms. “The abundant resources of this land provided the foundation for a great nation,” he writes. “But only people could make the opportunity a reality. Immigration provided the human resources.”

Both Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush strongly favored this cheap labor, high growth policy. In 1990, the first President Bush signed a bill doubling legal immigration, and in 2006 and 2007, George W. Bush pushed for a bill that would have further increased immigration.

In March 2019, the George W. Bush center released a video which effectively wrote Americans out of their own nation, while urging more immigration to spur national economic growth by reducing wages. “America’s story is an immigrant story,” says the video. “Now as before, American is a nation of immigrants,” says the video which refers to 280 million Americans as the “population,” “labor force,” “workers,” and even “natives.”

George W. Bush's Bush Center posts pro-migration, pro-business video which writes Americans out of American history: 'America’s story is an immigrant story,' says the video, which even describes some Americans as immigrants. https://t.co/oZEv3QpGop — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) March 18, 2019

Brands’ pitch, however, ignores the recent report by President Donald Trump’s economic advisors which said the nation can continue to grow without an extra supply of foreign workers.

There are “plenty of [American] workers on the sidelines able to come off” and fill jobs in the growing economy, said Rich Burkhauser, a member of Trump’s Council of Economic Advisors. Americans’ productivity is rising and more sidelined Americans are returning to the workforce as wages rise, said the report, titled, “Economic Report of the President.”

Investors and CEOs are increasingly desperate for an infusion of more foreign workers to lower the marketplace pressure for wage increases during 2019.

Goldman Sachs says Trump's tight labor-market policy (AKA 'Hire American') gave 4% raise to blue-collar/middle-class in 2018. But upper-income graduate salaries lagged – maybe b/c of 1.5 million visa-worker graduates who work for spaghettiOs & green cards https://t.co/g6jtv9BS81 — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) March 14, 2019

Each year, roughly four million young Americans join the workforce after high school or university. The federal government then imports roughly 1.1 million legal immigrants, refreshes a resident population of roughly 1.5 million white-collar guest workers and roughly 500,000 blue-collar visa workers, and it also tolerates about eight million illegal workers.

In 2019, because of catch-and-release rules mandated by Congress and the courts, the federal government also will likely release at least 350,000 Central American laborers into the U.S. job market, even as at least 500,000 more migrants sneak past U.S. border defenses or overstay their visas.

Overall, in 2019, the U.S. government will allow at least two million new foreign workers into the United States to compete for the starter jobs sought by the latest wave of four million U.S. graduates. The new migrants also undermine the 24 million other Americans and the roughly three million legal immigrants who have joined the workforce since 2014.

This federal policy of using legal and illegal migration to boost economic growth for investors shifts enormous wealth from young employees towards older investors by flooding the market with cheap white-collar graduates and blue-collar foreign labor.

This cheap labor economic policy forces Americans to compete even for low wage jobs, it widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids’ schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines millions of marginalized Americans, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.

The Federal Reserve’s monetary policymakers no longer believe they will raise rates this year. But the market has gone further and is pricing in a rate cut in the latter half of 2019.

The Fed Funds futures market, where traders can place bets on where the Fed’s overnight interest rate target will be in the months ahead, now forecasts that the rate will be lower by the end of the year than it is now.

The market is currently pricing in a 96 percent chance that rates will be unchanged at 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent after the Fed’s May meeting, with a sliver of a chance of a cut and no chance of a hike. But traders have bid enough on contracts for the June meeting that they are forecasting a 25% chance of a cut by then, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch Tool. By the July meeting, the odds rise to around a 33 percent for a cut.

The September meeting’s odds for a cut are 52.2 percent, which includes a non-trivial 11 percent chance of two cuts by that meeting. That rises to 57.7 percent for the October meeting and 66.6 percent for the December meeting. By January of 2020, the odds favor a cut by 74.1 to 25.9 percent.

This can be seen as the market agreeing with President Donald Trump’s claims last year that the Fed was too aggressive when it came to hiking rates. The Fed typically cuts rates in an effort to avoid or cut-short an economic slump, which means that traders in the Fed Funds Futures market are predicting a slower economy this year will prompt Fed action.


Wall Street analysts were reportedly underwhelmed by Apple’s latest event due to worries over the continued slowing of iPhone sales.

CNBC reports that following Apple’s recent event in which the tech company announced a number of new services, analysts were underwhelmed citing worries about the slowing of iPhone sales as a continued issue for the company. Goldman Sachs analyst Rod Hall stated: “Apple’s services reveal was materially different than we had anticipated. With small calculated impacts from these, ‘other services’, we expect the focus to return to the slowing iPhone business post this event.”

Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz commented on the event in a slightly more optimistic manner stating: “Overall, it appears that Apple’s new services provide better solutions to solve relatively niche problems in media business and they may prompt existing iOS users to stay more invested in Apple’s ecosystem. Pricing of Apple TV Plus is one of the biggest unanswered questions we have after the event.”

Morgan Stanley projects a higher stock price for Apple in the future stating: “Big picture, this strategy aligns with our thesis that Services, not devices, hold the key to Apple revenue and profitability growth over the next 5 years… However, the lack of specifics around pricing and timing limits us from raising estimates today…We still believe Apple is likely to bundle hardware/services and/or multiple services over time, with our September 2018 analysis suggesting Apple could generate $22-37 B in revenue by 2025 for an Apple Media bundle alone, up from $3..8B in 2018.”

Bank of America also gave Apple stock a buy rating but echoed concerns others had about the pricing of Apple’s new services stating: “Given some of these services are not available until the fall, it is surprising that Apple chose to schedule this event in March. Release dates and pricing for Apple Arcade and Apple TV+ were not announced, potentially because it is still working towards pricing agreements… In our opinion, pricing (and possible bundling of services) would in large part determine adoption rate.”

Details have been revealed about Mastercard’s controversial “digital identity” system, which will “bind” your identity to a smartphone or other device, and which has been compared to China’s social credit system and the bleak futurism of Netflix series Black Mirror.

In December, Mastercard announced the system, posting on Twitter, “Voting, driving, applying for a job, renting a home, getting married and boarding a plane: what do these all have in common? You need to prove your identity. In partnership with @Microsoft, we are working to create universally-recognized digital identity.”

And now more details about the digital identity system have been released.

Mastercard’s president of cyber and intelligence solutions, Ajay Bhalla, explained, “It’s a consumer-centric model for digital identity that gives consumers control… It will securely bind a person’s identity to their smartphone or any other device, and the idea is that this will unlock new and enhanced experiences for people as they interact with businesses and service providers.”

According to Wired, “Institutions that offer the ID and those that use it to verify transactions (like say, car rental companies or governments) would pay Mastercard to manage and oversee this verification network.”

“For example, the universal ID could allow someone to prove that they are old enough to buy alcohol under a given country’s laws without having to share their specific age. Or they could prove that they have a valid passport that meets set requirements without a hotel needing to know and store their passport number,” Wired reported. “These types of controls could significantly cut down on the troves of personal information hackers can grab in data breaches, and could even help cut down on shady data brokering among corporate third parties.”

However, the idea has become controversial, with some warning that the system would create “invasive surveillance apparatuses,” and others claiming it feels too similar to China’s social credit system.

Some even compared the system to George Orwell’s dystopian novel Nineteen-Eighty-Four, and the dark science-fiction television show Black Mirror.

“Sounds good in practice, but as we’re fans of Black Mirror here, our imaginations immediately jump to the dark side of tech, whereby Microsoft and MasterCard become a superpower by controlling people’s access to online things by the simple virtue of holding their identity in a vice-like digital grip,” wrote Roland Moore-Colyer for the Inquirer in December. “Now that might seem like an extreme and fanciful case of tech dystopia, and of course, it is. But there’s arguably a risk that if a database of secured identities gets compromised, suddenly people could find themselves without a digital identity and thereby locked out of their favourite online services or getting defrauded by cyber crooks.”

Last year, Mastercard reportedly forced funding platform Patreon to ban conservative author Robert Spencer from its platform, while in the same year, it was revealed that Mastercard and Google were working together to track users’ retail purchases.


Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) revealed Thursday that former President Barack Obama said he was “proud” of her during a meeting this week with House Democrat freshmen in Washington, D.C.

“President Obama met with us new members of Congress and it was a thoughtful discussion. The best part was when he looked straight at me and said, “I’m proud of you,” Tlaib wrote on Instagram, sharing a photo of her posing with the former president.

The Michigan Democrat, who is first Palestinian-American woman to serve in Congress, has quickly established herself as one of the most divisive lawmakers in Washington. Hours after being sworn in, Tlaib spoke before a reception held by the progressive MoveOn.org in which she vowed to “impeach the motherfucker,” a reference to President Trump. She has also pushed several antisemitic tropes, accusing pro-Israel lawmakers of forgetting which “country they represent.”

They forgot what country they represent. This is the U.S. where boycotting is a right & part of our historical fight for freedom & equality. Maybe a refresher on our U.S. Constitution is in order, then get back to opening up our government instead of taking our rights away. https://t.co/KkmqjR58ZM — Rashida Tlaib (@RashidaTlaib) January 7, 2019

Tlaib has a history of associating with anti-Jewish radicals, including Abbas Hamideh, an anti-Israel extremist and staunch supporter of the Hezbollah terror group, who she posed for a photo with at a swearing-in ceremony. She is also a supporter of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, a global campaign promoting various forms of boycotts against the Jewish state.

According to several reports, Obama met with Democrats to discuss how to advance legislation in an ever-polarized Congress. He also warned that bills or proposals attracting too much media attention before ample support is secured could hurt its prospects of being turned into law.

One source told the Washington Post that the former president also told the House Democrat freshman they “shouldn’t be afraid of big, bold ideas—but also need to think in the nitty-gritty about how those big, bold ideas will work and how you pay for them.”

While Obama did not single out a specific policy, some inside the room believe Obama was referring to the Green New Deal, the far-left proposal to pursue 100 percent non-combustible energy by 2030. The proposal, unveiled earlier this year by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA), was voted down in the Senate this week 57-0, with 42 Democrats voting “present.”

Obama on Tuesday posted to social media about the formal meet-and-greet with Democrats, tweeting: “Last night I had the chance to meet with first-term Democrats in Congress – it’s a young, diverse class, stocked with a bunch of my campaign and administration alums who’ve taken the torch. This group is going to be driving progress for a long time to come.”


The simple reason that Joe Biden must run for President of the United States is that almost all the other Democratic candidates are so radical that only Biden can stop the party from taking itself — and perhaps the country — off a cliff.

That thought occurred to me as I covered a rally by socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in Los Angeles last week.

Sanders currently leads the polls among declared 2020 candidates for the Democratic Party nomination. His rhetoric is radical, and his supporters are as well.

What Sanders says from the podium is nothing compared to the radicalism of the Sanders staff — some of whom are illegal aliens — and some of Sanders’ eager supporters.

Worse, Sanders’s rivals are just as bad. In 2016, his ideas were considered crazy; in 2019, they are being embraced by nearly all of the candidates, though they are no more practical today.

Sander championed “Medicare for All,” for example, and openly admits that the policy would ban private insurance, meaning tens of millions of Americans would lose the coverage they currently have and be forced to accept government insurance. Only 15% of Americans support such a plan, but most of the House Democrats support it, as do many of the presidential candidates, including fellow frontrunner Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA).

The “Green New Deal,” which Sanders also backs, along with almost all of the Democrats running, is a socialist mess so extreme that even solar and wind power companies are avoiding it. The Senate voted on it this week, and it was rejected unanimously, with most Democrats — including all of the co-sponsors and presidential candidates — voting “present.” Its inventor, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), is less popular than Trump in her own state.

On foreign policy, Sanders has views that are largely unchanged from those of the Cold War, when he cavorted in the Soviet Union on his honeymoon. (As Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) joked in 2015, Sanders “went to the Soviet Union on his honeymoon and I don’t think he ever came back.”) Sanders is leading the charge to protect Venezuelan dictator Nicholas Maduro. Some of his advisers are also not just anti-Israel, but also antisemitic in their criticism.

There, too, the rest of the field has followed Sanders’s lead to the left. Not one elected Democrat attended the opening of the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem last year, and not one Democratic presidential candidate attended the annual American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) conference this week (though a few met with pro-Israel lobbyists in their offices on Capitol Hill). Pro-Israel Democrats are privately beginning to panic about their party.

Analysts currently expect Democrats to have a good chance of winning the White House. But the radicalism of the Democratic candidates could make a winnable election a shoo-in for Donald Trump. And if Democrats do win, they will bring in an administration committed to the most radical socialist policies any country will have enacted since the fall of communism.

The results for the United States, and for the world in general, could be devastating.

Biden has many flaws, and has never done well running for president on his own. The former vice president also has questions to answer about questionable dealings in China involving his son. And he has spent the past several weeks apologizing for perceived past misdeeds on race and gender.

But Democrat donors must be beating down his door. The party needs him to run. And so, too, does the country. His Democratic rivals are is looking scarier each day.

The Trump administration sued California’s State Water Resourced Control Board (SWRCB) in federal court in Sacramento on Thursday, escalating a legal war over the fate of the water in the San Joaquin River valley system.

The San Joaquin River and its tributaries provide crucial water supplies to farming communities in the Central Valley — and also provide the vast majority of the drinking water supply to San Francisco and surrounding areas.

However, environmentalists, fishing interests, and Native American communities have claimed that overuse of the river system’s waters has resulted in a steep decline in native fish populations in the San Joaquin-Sacramento Delta.

Last December, the SWRCB approved a controversial plan that would require the San Joaquin River and its tributaries to maintain an average of 40% of “unimpeded flow,” i.e. the flow that would exist in the river system without human activity, for the late winter and spring months of February through June.

Environmentalists argued the plan does not go far enough, saying 60% of unimpeded flow would have been necessary to make a real difference in boosting fish populations. Farmers countered that other factors are affecting fish populations, including predation by non-native fish species in the Delta.

The board approved the plan despite efforts by then-Governor Jerry Brown and incoming Governor Gavin Newsom to broker voluntary water conservation agreements between the state and the local water districts that would involve fewer restrictions. The Trump administration was also critical of the plan, and Republicans urged the administration to block it.

Once the plan was approved, the various water users — rural and urban — filed dozens of lawsuits. And one of Newsom’s first acts as governor was to replace the SWRCB’s chair, Felicia Marcus, an environmental attorney.

Now the U.S. Department of the Interior has joined the fray. The Sacramento Bee notes: “The lawsuit … says the state water board’s plan would violate California’s own environmental laws, as well as foul up the federal government’s ability to deliver water from New Melones reservoir on the Stanislaus River to member agencies of the Central Valley Project.”

The legal fights are likely to go on for years unless a comprehensive set of voluntary agreements can be reached.

Donald Trump thrilled residents in Michigan on Thursday by announcing support for $300 million for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative.

“I support the Great Lakes. Always have. They are beautiful, they are big, very deep, record-deepness, right?” he said. “And I am going to get, in honor of my friends, full funding of $300 million for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, which you have been trying to get for over 30 years.”

The president announced his support during a political rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

The Office of Management and Budget proposed slashing the project budget because it fell under the Environmental Protection Agency.

The fund helps remove invasive species and toxic substances in the water and works to clean up pollution and protect local habitats.

“We will get it done. We will get it done,” Trump promised. “It is time.”


A new Marist poll released this week found an overwhelming majority of New York state residents oppose abortion later in pregnancy.

According to the survey, sponsored by the Knights of Columbus, 75 percent of New Yorkers oppose abortion after the fifth month of pregnancy, including 69 percent of Democrats, 73 percent of independents, and 89 percent of Republicans.

#KofC and @maristpoll shows most New Yorkers want more legal protections for the unborn: https://t.co/kdI1VReFNM @crux — Knights of Columbus (@KofC) March 30, 2019

While most New Yorkers (62 percent) identify as pro-choice as opposed to pro-life (34 percent), the poll found a majority of New Yorkers would actually limit abortion to — at most — the first three months of pregnancy.

“New Yorkers simply do not support laws that allow late-term abortions,” said Carl Anderson, CEO of the Knights of Columbus. “It is now clear that these radical policies are being pursued despite opposition by the majority of New Yorkers, and by a majority of those who identify as Democrats, Republicans and independents.”

According to the poll, 63 percent of New Yorkers also say abortion should be “generally illegal” in the last trimester of pregnancy, while 32 percent say it should be “generally legal.” This outcome includes 53 percent of New York Democrats, 65 percent of independents, and 84 percent of Republicans.

Nationally, Americans say third trimester abortion should be “generally illegal” by a margin of 71 to 25 percent.

The poll found that, when given options to describe their position on abortion, 66 percent of New Yorkers said they would limit abortion to — at most — the first trimester of pregnancy. Only 21 percent would allow the procedure into the third trimester, including 54 percent of Democrats, 65 percent of independents, and 88 percent of Republicans.

National results have shown eight in ten Americans would limit abortion to — at most — the first trimester of pregnancy.

The poll is released in the wake of a new bill signed into law by New York Democrat Gov. Andrew Cuomo that allows abortion at any time during pregnancy and declares abortion to be a fundamental right.

In February, a Siena College poll found Cuomo’s approval rating plummeted by eight percentage points in the month following the signing of the abortion bill into law — from 51 to 43 percent.

According to the poll, the percentage of those who view Cuomo unfavorably climbed from 43 to 50 percent during that period, leaving the governor with his popularity at its lowest point since 2011, when he took office.

In January, Cuomo ordered authorities to light up the World Trade Center in pink to celebrate his new abortion law.

In an attempt to defend himself against sharp criticism for signing the radical abortion legislation into law, Cuomo wrote in a New York Times op-ed that he is a “former altar boy” and that his “Roman Catholic values are [his] personal values.”

“Now, for the first time ever, half of New Yorkers view Andrew Cuomo unfavorably. It’s his lowest favorability rating ever and his lowest-ever job performance as governor,” said Siena College poll spokesman Steven Greenberg. “And it is a dramatic drop in both ratings from last month.”

In February, the Marist poll and the Knights of Columbus released a national survey showing that Americans opposed abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy, 71 to 18 percent.

That same poll found a “sudden and dramatic” 17-point shift toward the pro-life position since the recent legislation in New York and also in Virginia.

Breitbart News reported:

The poll finds a double-digit shift, with Americans now as likely to identify as pro-life (47 percent) as pro-choice (47 percent) since a similar Marist poll conducted in January. In addition, pro-life Democrats alone have shifted from 20 to 34 percent, an outcome that shows more than one-third of Democrats now identify as pro-life.

The current poll of 981 randomly selected adult residents of New York state was conducted February 25 through March 4, 2019. Participants were contacted on landline or mobile numbers and interviewed in English by telephone using live interviewers. Results are statistically significant within plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.
