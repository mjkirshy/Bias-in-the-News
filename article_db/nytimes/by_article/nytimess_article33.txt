This nontraditional recipe features the ultimate paella cheat: The dish cooks in the oven, as opposed to being actively monitored on the stovetop over a flame. Cooking it this way wont get you the familiar socarrat on the bottom of the skillet, but the wonderfully crispy bits that develop at the edges of the roasting pan are delightful in their own way.
