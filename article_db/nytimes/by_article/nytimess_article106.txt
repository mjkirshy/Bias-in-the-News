Therapists, of course, deal with the daily challenges of living just as everyone else does. In fact, this familiarity is at the root of the connection we forge with strangers who trust us with their most intimate stories and secrets. Our training has taught us theories and tools and techniques, but whirring beneath our expertise is the fact that we know just how hard it is to be a person. Which is to say, we still come to work each day as ourselves  with our own sets of vulnerabilities, our own longings and insecurities and our own experiences and histories. Of all my credentials as a therapist, my most significant is that Im a card-carrying member of the human race. Without this humanity, Id be useless to help people.

But revealing this humanity is another matter.

Most therapists nowadays use some form of whats known as self-disclosure in their work, whether its sharing some of their own reactions that come up during the session or acknowledging that they watch the TV show a patient keeps referring to. Better to admit that you watch The Bachelor than to feign ignorance and accidentally say Colton Underwoods name when the patient hasnt mentioned him yet.

The question of what to share gets tricky. One therapist I know told a patient whose child had Tourettes syndrome that she, too, had a son with Tourettes, and it deepened their relationship. Another colleague treated a man whose father had taken his own life, but he never revealed to the patient that his own father had done the same. In each situation, theres a calculation to make, a subjective litmus test we use to assess the value of the disclosure: Is this information helpful for the patient to have?

Outside the therapy room, though, what are the rules? Here are some things you dont want to do in public as a therapist: Cry to a friend in a restaurant or say, I know, Mom! petulantly into your cellphone while in line at Costco with a patient nearby. If youre a respected child psychologist, like a colleague of mine, you dont want to be standing in the bakery when your 4-year-old has a meltdown about not getting another cookie, culminating with the ear-piercing proclamation Youre the worst mom ever! while your 6-year-old patient and her mother look on, aghast.
