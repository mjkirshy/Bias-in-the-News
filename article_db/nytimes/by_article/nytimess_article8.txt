A 7-year-old Guatemalan girl who died in United States custody last December was suffering from a bacterial infection that was so advanced she probably would have been visibly sick for many hours, said several physicians who reviewed a newly released autopsy report of her death.

By the time the girl, Jakelin Caal Maquin, arrived at a childrens hospital in El Paso with seizures and difficulty breathing, she already had severe blood abnormalities, according to a part of the report that summarized her condition in the emergency room of the Childrens Hospital at the Hospitals of Providence Memorial Campus.

The new findings were released on Friday by the El Paso County Office of the Medical Examiner. Customs and Border Protection officials and lawyers for the girls family have sparred over whether the severity of her infection  with a common streptococcus bacteria  should have been recognized and whether she should have been taken for medical care more quickly.
