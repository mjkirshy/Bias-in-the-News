HERAT, Afghanistan  A 2017 wall calendar dangled from a nail over Kawsar Roshans bed on the otherwise blank wall of her room. Best year for me she had written, in curly script, above aerial photos of lakes and waterfalls. She drew a smiley-face next to her wobbly English letters.

The out-of-date calendar was nothing too special, said Kawsar, though she does love waterfalls, especially Niagara Falls  which she saw with her own eyes during that best year.

Kawsar, then 16, saw a lot of places as a member of Afghanistans first-ever girls robotics team. More than any other Afghan girl she knows. Or boy. Or even grown-up, for that matter.

You may remember hearing about that team. In the summer of 2017, Kawsar and five teammates, along with their coach, were denied visas into the United States for a robotics competition in Washington, prompting an international outcry.
