This creamy, vibrant soup is a Thai-inspired version of the pured squash soup you know and love. The green curry paste, which is relatively easy to find in the international aisle of the grocery store, along with coconut milk and fish sauce, perfectly complements the butternut squash's sweetness. But it's the topping  a spin on miang kham, a snack in Thailand and Laos full of peanuts, coconut and chiles  that's the real standout.
