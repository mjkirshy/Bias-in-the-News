It is possible that you didnt know a 24-year-old black woman started the integration of the New York City mass transit system in 1854. Its a very good story that involves some kicking and screaming, a ruined hat and a future president of the United States.

And now shes getting a statue next to Grand Central Station. About time.

Were coming to the end of Womens History Month, and all in all, its been a pretty good celebration. Perhaps a little superior to the one when Donald Trump dropped in on a womens empowerment panel and asked the assembled high achievers whether any of them had ever heard of Susan B. Anthony.

So about Elizabeth Jennings, a Manhattan schoolteacher in the years before the Civil War. She was rushing to church services, where she was supposed to play the organ, when a trolley conductor told her that his car was only for white people and shed have to get off and wait for another ride.

Jennings was fearless. She grabbed onto an open window frame, screaming Murder! when the conductor tried to pull her off. She hung on for dear life until a police officer shoved her onto the sidewalk, soiling her going-to-church dress and smashing her bonnet.
