Even here Dubowitz is merely warming to his theme. Freeze Irans foreign exchange reserves? Doable. Expose the immense wealth of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and sanction the companies he and other leading regime figures control? Ditto. Unleash lawsuits against companies still doing business with Iran to recover billions of dollars in outstanding terrorism judgments against the country? That, too.

The point isnt to punish Iran for punishments sake. Its to create leverage for a better nuclear deal. Last May, Mike Pompeo set a dozen parameters for an agreement, including unqualified access to U.N. nuclear inspectors, permanent cessation of uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing, the end of Irans ballistic-missile program, withdrawal of its forces from Syria, and the release of U.S. nationals held in its prisons.

Pompeos demands have been alternatively dismissed as silly or reckless by most of Washingtons foreign policy establishment. But it says something about the debasement of diplomatic expectations  both of what we have a right to demand and what we think we can achieve  that any of it should be controversial.

Non-nuclear states that sponsor terrorism and subscribe to millenarian ideologies should never have access to any part of the nuclear fuel cycle, ever. Any U.S. administration that abdicates the responsibility to do everything it can to prevent such access effectively renounces Americas status as a superpower as well.

Irans G.D.P. is roughly equivalent to that of the greater Boston area, with 17 times the population. The regime may be a force to be reckoned with in the Middle East. But it is hardly a giant on the world stage, immune to any form of economic pressure.

The Trump administration has succeeded in dramatically raising the costs to Iran for its sinister behavior, at no cost to the United States or our allies. Thats the definition of a foreign-policy achievement. Its time to move the needle up again. The longer Hezbollah fighters go unpaid, or the Assad regime unaided, the better off the people of the Middle East will be.
