WASHINGTON  In a major legal blow to President Trumps push to expand offshore oil and gas development, a federal judge ruled that an executive order by Mr. Trump that lifted an Obama-era ban on oil and gas drilling in the Arctic Ocean was unlawful.

The decision, by Judge Sharon L. Gleason of the United States District Court for the District of Alaska, concluded late Friday that President Barack Obamas 2015 and 2016 withdrawal of about 120 million acres of Arctic Ocean from drilling will remain in full force and effect unless and until revoked by Congress. She wrote that an April 2017 executive order by Mr. Trump revoking the drilling ban is unlawful, as it exceeded the presidents authority.

The decision, which is expected to be appealed in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, immediately reinstates the drilling ban on most of the Arctic Ocean off the coast of Alaska, a pristine region home to endangered species including polar bears and bowhead whales where oil companies have long sought to drill. It also has broader implications for Mr. Trumps effort to push drilling across the American coastline and on public lands.

Specifically, the Arctic Ocean drilling case could give legal ammunition to opponents of Mr. Trumps efforts to roll back protections for two million acres of national monuments created by Mr. Obama and President Bill Clinton .
