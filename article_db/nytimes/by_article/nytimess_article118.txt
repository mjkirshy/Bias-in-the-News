Like everybody else, Ive often heard that chefs home refrigerators are famously empty. Because we work so hard, so long, so late, the mythology suggests, we dont ever cook at home. Everybody seems to know, and admire, that our home fridges are echo chambers but for a six-pack of beer and a bottle of hot sauce. I notice I respond to this bit of rock n roll chef hype the same way I do when I read about that supposedly inviolable routine of accomplished and serious writers, the one in which the writer wakes up and writes for four hours and then goes for a walk to clear the mind and then after lunch reads in the afternoon and then goes to the pub for a few drinks before dinner and then retires by the fire before bed.

Which is: Oh, man. Must be nice!

But if you find yourself in the thick of, say, a brisk chef career, with maybe a professional writing gig on the side, as well as the not-negligible project of keeping a home, loaded up with the added considerations of some compelling children in the household whom you might like to see and know before they are gone, you probably have managed to keep a few vegetables in the drawer and a carton of eggs and a bin of cheeses and deli meats at least. I recommend adding a container of this anchovy-garlic dressing to your fridge too, at all times. Its nothing, really  a jar of startlingly flavorful salad dressing essentially  but it does some improbable heavy lifting. And at mealtime, no matter how loosely defined, it can make you feel less like a barn animal at the trough and more like a civilized human at the table. Even if you are standing in front of the fridge with the door open rooting in the drawers at 2:30 in the morning.
